# Question

# Study Construct

- Systematic review (SR)
- 20 study SR
- Subjective indicators:
    - Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
    - Rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
- Objective measures:
    - Countermovement jump (CMJ)
    - Blood plasma markers
        - [Creatine kinase (CK)](#results)
        - [Lactate/lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)](#results)
        - [C reactive protein](#results)
        - [IL-6](#results)

Methods:
Studies included CWI immersion to the iliac crest/umbilicus at temperatures from 5-15 C. Other studies included CWI submerged to mid sternal level and shoulder level at 6-15 C.


# Results

Cold water immersion (CWI) was found to have:

- A decline in DOMS  (VAS scale) significantly lower VAS at 0 h and 24 hr , none at 48 h
Decline in RPE immediately (0/1-10 scales) at 0 hours (none at 24 or 48 h)
Reduced CMJ immediately (at 0 hr)

- [Creatine kinase (CK)]({{< var ref-creatine-kinase.path >}}) lowered at 24 hr, (no difference at 0 or 48 h)
lactate lowered at 24 and 48 h. 
No evidence that CWI impacts CRP and IL6 during 48 hours
They found that water temp and CWI sites have no effect on fatigue recovery
