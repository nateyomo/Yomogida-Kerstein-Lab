An ester linkage is a chemical bond between an acid and an alcohol. In triacylglycerols, the ester linkage consists of an acid (fatty acid) and it is chemically bound to an alcohol (glycerol)1.\n\n\nFunction\nTriacylglycerols are nonpolar and hydrophobic molecules since the polar hydroxyls of glycerol and the polar carboxylates of the fatty acids are bound in ester linkages1. Due to their nonpolar and hydrophobic state, triacylglycerols are essentially insoluble in water, which is crucial for their role in energy storage.\n\n\nSimple & Complex\nTriaglyceroles consisting of a single type of fatty acid in all 3 positions is called “simple triacylglycerols” and are named after the fatty acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nPalmitic acid (16:0) simple triacylglycerol → Tripalmitin\nStearic acid (18:0) simple triacylglycerol → Tristearin\nOleic acid (18:1) simple triacylglycerol → Triolein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMost naturally occurring triacylglycerols are mixed1\n\n\nTo name non-simple triacylglycerols without ambiguity, the name and position of each fatty acid must be specified1.\n\n\nRole in Energy Storage\nIn vertebrates, triacylglycerols are stored in specialized cells called “adipocytes”, or “fat cells”1. These adipocytes store large amounts of triacylglycerols as fat droplets that nearly fill the cell1.\n\n\nVersus polysaccharides\nTriacylglycerols have 2 significant advantages that make it better for energy storage than polysaccharides (starch or glycogen)1.\n\nFatty acid carbon atoms are more reduced and therefore yield more (&gt;2x) energy\nTriacylglycerols are hydrophobic and do not need to be hydrated1. Oppositely, polysaccharides need to be hydrated and thus require the organism to carry extra water to maintain polysaccharide hydration1.\n\nTriacylglycerols can hold much more energy (weeks to months) than glycogen1. Glycogen has its benefits since it can produce metabolic energy quicker due to their water solubility1.\n\n\nSerum\nBlood test for serum triglycerides\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "PUFAs refer to a family of lipids which have a double bond between the 3rd carbon and the 4th carbon from the methyl end of the chain1. This family of lipids plays an important role in human nutrition.\n\nOmega nomenclature\nSince the physiological function of the lipid is dictated by the position of the 1st double bond relative to the methyl end of the chain, PUFA’s have an alternative nomenclature based on the methyl end1.\n\nThe carbon of the methyl group is the most distant from the carboxyl group, and thus it is called ω (omega; the last letter in the Greek alphabet) carbon1.\nThis ω carbon is given the number 1 (C-1)1.\nthe carboxyl carbon is on the opposite end and thus has the highest number1.\nThis naming scheme allows one to signify the position of the double bond (number) from the methyl group (ω)1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nPUFA with a double bond between the C-3 and C-4 carbons are called omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids1\nPUFA with a double bond between C-6 and C-7 are called omega-6 (ω-6) fatty acids1\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet\nAn imbalance of omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs in the diet is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease1\nAccording to Lehninger, the optimal dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the diet ranges from 1:1 and 4:11.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

With these results, a dietary requirment of 1% and then 2% of the total daily caloric intake should be linoleic acid was established1. This idea was believed to be further supported by two studies where human infants intaking linoleic acid abolished the physiological symptoms of omega-6 deficiency1."

    "text": "Counterargument\nUpon review of these articles supporting the “essential” nature of linoleic acid, these studies have multiple drawbacks.\n\nThe conclusion established using the controlled diets were experiencing a “dual deficiency” in omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nsee2\n\n\n\nDual Deficiency\nSubsequent studies in rat models similar to those used to originally classify LA as an essential fatty acid have demonstrated that the dietary omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is able to diminish the symptoms of LA deficiency [22].\nThis strongly suggests that the absence of ALA in the original studies probably heightened the significance of the physiological symptoms caused by LA deficiency. It seems that, at least for the rat model, the nutritional requirement for LA has probably been seriously overestimated.\nA more precise estimation of the LA requirement is likely closer to a 75% reduction, or 0.5%, of the dietary energy rather than 2% [23].\nThis calls into question how “essential” LA really is in the human diet since we cannot determine what symptoms were due to deficiency of omega-6 or omega-3. This likely overestimates the LA requirement in humans. To make this worse, the Institute of Medicine (IoM) arbitrarily decided to further overestimate the recommended intake, creating an upper limit of 10%1. Even then, the USDA reports that most American adults are consuming above the IoM limit of 10%1."
