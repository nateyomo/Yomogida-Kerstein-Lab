Locomotor training using partial body weight support, a treadmill, and early assisted limb movements has also been shown to promote function induced recovery (see Chapter 10: Interventions to Improve Locomotor Skills and Case Study 3) The elements essential for success with these interventions are that (1) practice is task specific and (2) practice is intense, with steady increases in duration and frequency. For example, in CIMT, the patient with stroke practices grasping and manipulating objects during daily tasks using the more affected UE 4 to 6 hours per day, every day. The less-affected UE may be constrained with a mitt, thereby preventing all attempts at compensatory movements."

    "text": "Lesions of the anterior lobe of the cerebellum can also be accompanied by a discrete impairment in gait, and those affecting the flocculonodular lobe affect equilibrium [29]. Cerebellar lesions may affect gait by causing disequilibrium and by altering limb and trunk kinematics and interlimb coordination [20]. The cerebellum does not appear to actually generate postural and gait synergies because these automatic responses, albeit very dysmetric, are present in dogs with total cerebellectomy [58]. Disturbances of gait and balance are primarily caused by lesions of the vestibulocerebellum and spinocerebellum or their connections. Lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres cause irregular timing, force, and cadence of leg movements, leading to inaccurate and variable stepping [32]. Lesions of the vestibulocerebellum, or flocculonodular lobe, can produce1\nbalance and gait disturbances that resemble those caused by vestibular lesions [20]. Tremor of the head and trunk, truncal imbalance, and swaying and falling in all directions are characteristic of vestibulocerebellar lesions. Vestibular nystagmus may be present. Although most often patients with cerebellar lesions tend to fall to the side of the lesion, some patients with lesions in the tonsillar area develop increased tone (and increased reflexes) in the ipsilateral side and fall to the contralateral side. The clinical syndrome caused by lesions of the spinocerebellum is best characterized by alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, which primarily affects the anterior lobe of the cerebellum but also involves the olivary complex and the vestibular nuclei [71]. Patients with alcoholic cerebellar degeneration have a widened base, instability of the trunk, slow and halting gait with irregular steps and superimposed lurching. The gait abnormalities are accentuated at the initiation of gait, on turning, and with changes in gait speed. These patients may have severe gait ataxia without nystagmus, dysarthria, or arm dysmetria. Even the heel-to-shin test may give little inkling of the severity of the gait disturbance. The anterior lobe of the cerebellum is exquisitely sensitive to many metabolic injuries, not just alcohol. For instance, in severe hypoxia, the anterior lobe can be severely damaged, whereas the rest of the cerebellum may be spared1.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Brazis PW, Masdeu JC, Biller J.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Corticospinal tract lesions give rise to a spastic gait, unilateral or hemiparetic when the lesion is unilateral and paraparetic when the lesion is bilateral. The base of support is narrow, so much so that with bilateral lesions the legs tend to cross in front of each other in a pattern that has been called “scissors gait.” The leg is externally rotated at the hip. The knee is extended and stiff, so the patient walks as if on a stilt. The foot is plantar flexed and inverted; for this reason, the patient tends to scrape the floor with the outer edge of the foot; the patient’s turns are slow. With each step the affected leg is rotated away from the body, then toward it (circumduction). There is also difficulty picking up the toes on the hemiparetic side, when instructed to walk on the heels and decrease cadence of gait. The lesion can be anywhere along the corticospinal tract. When the lesion is unilateral, the abnormality is easy to diagnose.1\nBilateral lesions, particularly when they cause a slowly progressive syndrome, are more difficult to diagnose early in the course of the disease. The cervical myelopathy of cervical spondylosis, a relatively common syndrome, belongs to this category. Cervical spondylosis tends to cause demyelinating lesions in the posterior columns and corticospinal tracts of the cervical spinal cord. The most common place of involvement is at the C5 C6 interspace. Severe lesions in this location result in paraparesis and clumsiness of the hand with atrophy in the small muscles of the hand. Milder lesions may only give rise to unsteadiness while walking or standing, often accompanied by a positive Romberg sign [43]. The brachioradialis reflex may be depressed, and instead, a brisk finger flexor response is elicited when percussing the brachioradialis tendon (inverted radial reflex). Careful testing of vibratory sense may reveal a sensory level in the cervical region. Sometimes, the patient perceives the stimulus better in the thumb than in the small finger. Early diagnosis is important because the myelopathy of cervical spondylosis is often progressive if untreated [59].1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Brazis PW, Masdeu JC, Biller J.

You should avoid Grade V mobilizations (HVLAT)1. One should introduce the application of incrementally greater movements and loads or investigate VA flow using Doppler sonography or an magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) scan before performing a grade V technique in the cervical spine1. The clinician should consider avoiding placing the patient’s cervical spine in the extremes of rotation and side bending in both the examination and the subsequent intervention, which would obviate the need for these tests1."

Gradually, this will result in a gradual cessation of anterior horn cell function, resulting in cell death1. In the upp motor neurons, Betz cells would result from diminished release of neurotrophic hormone from the target neurons1.

Internal validity determines whether the study was setup in a way that will accurately answer the initial question without influence of other variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a study with internal validity?\n\n\n\n“If a study is internally valid, this means that any effects/changes or lack thereof in the dependent variable can be directly attributed to the manipulation of the independent variable” -Polgar & Thomas1.\n\n\n\n\nFace Validity\n\nFace validity refers to the extent to which a test or measure appears to measure what it purports to measure1.\nThus, it is “really based on the personal opinions of those either taking or giving a test.”1\nIndeed, the importance of face validity relates most significantly to the perceptions of research subjects1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFace validity is often identified with content validity since is less applicable to formal scientific testing1.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of validity to organize\nMeasurement validity relates to the extent to which an insvumerlt measures what it is intended to measure and can refer equally to nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio levels of measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In this exercise, one will have a leg on the ground (stance leg) and another leg in the air. Both shoulders will remain on the ground the whole time. As an example, we will imagine an individual using their R leg as the stance leg. Since both shoulders are stationary, the weight of the pelvis and raised leg (L) will add a load d/t gravity that pulls the L hip towards the ground, resulting in relative right rotation. Thus, in order to keep the pelvis level, one must perform active left rotation using the R multifidus since the multifidi perform C/L rotation unilaterally. An easy way to remember which multifid you are recruiting during S/L bridge is that the multifidi on the same side as the stance leg is being recruited."

The much larger deep head attaches on the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone (see Figs. 11.5 and 11.6). The smaller superficial head attaches to a region of the posterior side of the maxilla, just above the third molar (compare perspectives of Figs. 11.6 and 11.7).99 Both heads course nearly parallel with the masseter muscle and attach on the internal surface of the ramus, near the angle of the mandible (compare perspectives of Figs. 11.2 and 11.4). The actions of the two heads of the medial pterygoid are essentially identical. Acting bilaterally, the medial pterygoid elevates and, to a limited extent, protrudes the mandible. Because of the oblique line of force of the muscle, a unilateral contraction of the medial pterygoid produces a very effective contralateral excursion of the mandible”2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction between Medial pterygoid and masseter\n\n\n\n“T he medial pterygoid and masseter muscles form a functional sling around the angle of the mandible (Fig. 11.20). Simultaneous contractions of these muscles can exert a powerful biting force that is directed through the jaw and ultimately between the upper and lower molars.57 The maximal biting force in this region averages about 422 N (95 lb) in the adult, twice that generated between the incisors.61 Acting on the internal and external sides of the mandible, the masseter and medial pterygoid also produce an important sideto-side force between the upper and lower molars. As shown in Fig. 11.18, simultaneous contraction of the right medial pterygoid and left masseter produces left lateral deviation. Contraction of these muscles in this synergistic fashion can produce a very effective shear force between the molars and food, on both sides of the mouth. The combined muscular action is very effective at grinding and crushing food before swallowing.articular disc. The inferior head attaches within the pterygoid fossa and adjacent neck of the mandible. A third head of the muscle has also been proposed, based on the multiple pattern of distal attachments.”\n“The precise action and role of the two heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle during mastication is controversial and not completely understood.74,106 The lack of understanding partially reflects the muscle’s deep location and subsequent technical challenge to electromyographic study. It is generally agreed, however, that unilateral contraction of both heads of the lateral pterygoid produces contralateral excursion of the mandible (see Fig. 11.18). Furthermore, unilateral muscle contraction rotates the ipsilateral condyle anterior-medially within the horizontal plane—a typical kinematic component of contralateral excursion (reviewed in Fig 11.14B). Usually a given right or left lateral pterygoid muscle contracts synergistically with other muscles during mastication. For example, as depicted in Fig. 11.18, a biting motion that involves left lateral excursion is controlled by the right lateral and medial pterygoid muscles and, to a lesser extent, by the left masseter and temporalis.”\n“Bilateral contraction of both heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle produces a strong protrusion of the mandible.61 As fully described ahead in the discussion of muscular control of opening and closing of the mouth, the two heads of the lateral pterygoid are active at different phases of opening and closing of the mouth. (For this and other morphologic considerations, some authors have argued that the two heads of the lateral pterygoid are actually separate muscles.28) Most sources suggest that the inferior head is the primary depressor of the mandible, especially during resisted opening of the mouth.65,74,77,82 The superior head, in contrast, helps control the tension within the disc and its position during resisted closure of the jaw.65,74 This action is especially important during resisted, unilateral closure of the jaw, such as when biting down on a hard piece of candy.”\n\n\n\n\nPalpation\nIntraoral: Posterior and medial to mandibular molars (have subject deviate away)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Significance\n\n1.

The patient received natural and synthetic antibiotics and steroids to resolve the acute signs of infection, but this did not yield any functional improvement2. Rongies et al., found full and rapid resolution of extraocular paralysis and diploplia using periorbital hydrocortisone iontophoresis, visuomotor exercises combined with intense ideomotor stimulation2.\nInterventions\n\nIontophoresis\n\nIontophoretic treatment of various ophthalmic conditions2.\nUsed as a means of noninvasive, transdermal drug delivery\nPerformed in the orbital region affected by extraocular muscle palsy ( The selected technique of ocular iontophoresis was indirect, through a closed eyelid)2.\nDrug: Corhydron 100 [hydrocortisone] at 50 mg/5mL of a sodium chloride solution as a solvent2.\nThe procedure used direct (or galvanic) current.\nDuration of each single iontophoresis procedure was 20 minutes2\nPt position: Upright sitting position with head and forearms supported (to enable observation of autonomic nervous system related adverse effects)2.\n\nExercise\n\nExercise performed immediately after iontophoresis2.\n30-minute set of PT supervised exercises2.\nBreaks\n\nAllowed if: 1. Pt reported feeling of muscle fatigue or 2. distinct deceleration of eyeball movements was observed\nFrequency of breaks: gradually decreased from every several seconds to every 2 minutes\n\nExercise Type: Attempts to follow with the gaze an object (patient’s hand) moving diagonally in space (in alternate pattern), with additional simultaneous ideomotor stimulation2.\nThe amplitude of movement progressively increased during the rehabilitation sessions. The patient performed his exercises in sitting and standing positions positions which improved comfort by avoiding forced position. His head was still. Each exercise session was conducted in setting that limited the patient’s distraction. The patient was advised to perform these exercises at home 2-3 times a day. The outcome measures for this study were the range of eye movement, reaction times during eye movement and muscle endurance, in comparison with these in the unaffected eye. The results were evaluated visually by 3 independent researchers who were not involved in the process of treatment. The range of movement improvement has been documented in the picture.\n\nResults:\n\nRongies used daily physical therapy and the patient regained distinct movement within 4 days2.\nBy session 16, the patient displayed complete return of function in all paralyzed muscles2."

    "text": "In human skin, for example, there exist nociceptors that respond only to mechanical, only to cold thermal, or only to hot thermal stimuli as well as those that are insensitive to both mechanical and heat stimuli (mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors)1\nThe most abundant is the polymodal nociceptor, which responds to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. In general, nociceptors that innervate skin have the broadest range of modality selectivity1\nnociceptors innervating deeper structures tend to be less modality-selective and more polymodal in character. For example, mechanical sensitivity is a prominent feature of visceral and joint nociceptors because stimuli adequate for their activation include hollow organ distension and overrotation, respectively1.\nMany of these nociceptors also respond to chemical and/or thermal stimuli as well, although the functional significance of thermal sensitivity in deep tissues is uncertain1.\nAn important characteristic of polymodal nociceptors, whether the modalities of stimulation to which they respond are two or all three, is that when sensitized (e.g., by an inflammatory insult), responses to the other modality or modalities of stimuli to which it responds are all increased\n\nMechanosensitivity\nNociceptors with low mechanical thresholds for response and those with very high mechanical thresholds for response (i.e., sleeping nociceptors) are both clinically important.\nMechanosensitive sensory neurons with low thresholds for response have long been classified as “non-nociceptors” (because it was considered that nociceptors had to have response thresholds in the noxious range)1.\nSome mechanosensitive skin, joint, and many visceral sensory neurons have low thresholds for response (i.e., in the nonnoxious range) but possess characteristics that suggest an important role in pain.\n\nFirst: these low-threshold receptors encode stimulus intensity well into the noxious range and, moreover, typically give greater responses to all intensities of stimulation than do nociceptors with high mechanical thresholds for response1.\nSecond: they sensitize after tissue insult. Unlike nociceptors with low mechanical thresholds, mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors normally provide no information to the central nervous system but after tissue insult become spontaneously active and mechanosensitive1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Definition\nPain associated with cancer includes pain associated with disease progression as well as treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) that may damage the nervous system. Although some contend that pain associated with neoplastic disease is unique, in the majority of instances, we view it as fitting within our description of acute and chronic pain, as depicted in Figure 2.1. Moreover, pain associated with cancer can have multiple causes, namely, disease progression, treatment, and co-occurring diseases (e.g., arthritis). Regardless of whether the pain associated with cancer stems from disease progression, treatment, or a cooccurring disease, it may be either acute or chronic. Thus, we do not advocate a separate classification of cancer pain as distinct from acute and chronic pain. Some concerns have also been raised regarding the common usage of chronic malignant and chronic benign pain4; often, pain unrelated to cancer is implicitly view as “benign” to distinguish it from cancer-related pain. Certainly, people who have pain associated with neoplastic disease experience a unique and disease-specific situation, but from a mechanistic perspective, there may be little to substantiate continued use of this dichotomy. Moreover, patients who have chronic noncancer pain who are told that their pain is “benign” may feel denigrated because, from their perspective, the inference is that their pain is not a serious concern.1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Episodic or intermittent occurrences of pain, with each episode lasting for a relatively short period of time but recurring across an extended period of time (e.g., migraine headaches, tic douloureux, sickle cell crisis, dysmenorrhea). Our distinction between acute and chronic pain using the integration of the dimensions of time and pathology does not specifically include recurrent pain. In the case of recurrent pain, patients may experience episodes of pain interspersed with periods of being completely pain-free. Although recurrent pain may seem acute because each pain episode (e.g., headache) is of relatively short duration, the pathophysiology of many recurrent pain disorders (e.g., migraine) is not well understood. Syndromes characterized by recurrent acute pain share features in common with both acute and chronic pain. The fact that these syndromes extend over time, however, suggests that psychosocial and behavioral factors, not only physical pathology, may be major contributors to emotional and behavioral responses. IASP4 now includes recurrent pain lasting longer than 3 months within its definition of chronic pain. However, it is not clear whether multiple episodes lasting several days within 3 months would meet the chronic pain criterion or whether the pain must last at least 3 months. That is, would multiple migraines in a 3-month period be chronic even if there were pain-free periods within the 3 month period?1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Ballantyne J, Fishman S, Rathmell JP, eds.

    "text": "Sensory Pathway\n\n\n\nTrigeminal Sensory System Nuclei and Pathways (from Blumenfeld figure 12.81)\n\n\n\nSomatosensory afferent nerves convey crude touch, pain, and temperature sensation from the face and mouth to the lateral pons1.\nThese nerve fibers then descend the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus1.\n. Similarly, the spinal trigeminal tract is analogous to Lissauer’s tract (see Figures 6.4 and 7.2). Secondary sensory neurons from the spinal trigeminal nucleus cross the brainstem to ascend as the trigeminothalamic tract (or ventral trigeminothalamic tract). The trigeminothalamic tract is analogous to the spinothalamic tract (see Table 12.6), and the pathways travel together to the thalamus (see Figures 12.8 and 14.3). Trigeminothalamic tract fibers synapse in the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), and tertiary sensory neurons then travel in the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex. Like the anterolateral systems in the spinal cord, there are also pathways from the spinal trigeminal nucleus to intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the reticular formation, and other areas, to mediate the affective and arousal aspects of facial pain.\n\nIn summary, it is generally believed that sensory fibers involved in the conduction of pain and temperature spread over the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and then cross over to the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex4"

As will be described ahead, protrusion and retrusion are fundamental components of full opening and closing of the mouth, respectively.\nArthrokinematics:\n\n“During protrusion and retrusion the mandibular condyle and disc translate anteriorly and posteriorly, respectively, relative to the fossa (see Fig. 11.13). Maximum condylar translation of about 1.25 cm (about 12 inch) has been measured in each direction in healthy adults.8 The condyle and disc follow the downward slope of the articular eminence. The mandible slides slightly downward during protrusion and slightly upward during retrusion. The path and extent of the movement usually vary depending on the degree of opening and closing of the mouth (described ahead).”1"

For purposes of evaluating dental occlusion, dentists frequently refer to the side of the lateral excursion movement as the “working” side of the mandible.”1\n\n\nArthrokinematics\n“Lateral excursion involves primarily a side-to-side translation of the condyle and disc within the fossa. Slight multiplanar rotations are typically combined with lateral excursion. For example, Fig. 11.14B shows lateral excursion combined with a slight horizontal plane rotation. The mandibular condyle on the side of the lateral excursion serves as a relatively fixed pivot point, allowing a slightly wider arc of rotation by the contralateral condyle.”1"

    "text": "Depression & Elevation\n\n\n\nTMJ Depression and elevation (fig 11.151)\n\n\nOsteokinematics:\n\n“Depression of the mandible causes the mouth to open, a fundamental component of chewing (see Fig. 11.15A). Maximal opening of the mouth typically occurs during actions such as yawning and singing. In the adult the mouth can be opened an average of 45–50 mm as measured between the incisal edges of the upper and lower front teeth.18,43,97 T he interincisal opening is typically large enough to fit three adult “knuckles” (proximal interphalangeal joints). Typical mastication, however, requires an average maximal opening of 18 mm—about 38% of maximum (sufficient to accept one adult knuckle). Being unable to fit two knuckles between the edges of the upper and lower incisors is usually considered abnormal in the average sized adult. Elevation of the mandible closes the mouth—an action used to crush food during mastication (see Fig. 11.15B). During this process, the teeth within the elevating mandible strongly oppose the teeth within the fixed maxilla.”\n\nArthrokinematics:\n“Opening and closing of the mouth occur by depression and elevation of the mandible, respectively. During these movements, each TMJ experiences a combination of rotation and translation among the mandibular condyle, articular disc, and fossa. No other joint in the body experiences such a large proportion of translation and rotation. These complex arthrokinematics are a necessary mechanical component of mastication (grinding and crushing of food) and for speaking. Because rotation and translation occur simultaneously, the axis of rotation is constantly moving. In the ideal case the movements within both TMJs result in a maximal range of mouth opening with minimal stress placed on the articular surfaces.”\n\nEarly phase:\n\nfirst 35-50% of ROM1\n\n\n\n“The early phase, constituting the first 35% to 50% of the range of motion, involves primarily rotation of the mandible relative to the cranium. As depicted in Fig. 11.16A, the condyle rolls posteriorly within the concave inferior surface of the disc. (The direction of the roll is described relative to the rotation of a point on the ramus of the mandible.) The rolling motion swings the body of the mandible inferiorly and posteriorly. The axis of rotation for this motion is not fixed but migrates within the vicinity of the mandibular neck and condyle.32,77,83 The rolling motion of the condyle stretches the oblique portion of the lateral ligament, which may help initiate the late phase of opening the mouth”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is likely not possible to define a single rotation-to-translation kinematic of the TMJ during opening/closing due to natural intersubject variability in movement strategy and on overall cranial-dental anatomy1\n\n\n“The late phase of opening the mouth consists of the final 50% to 65% of the total range of motion. This phase is marked by a gradual transition from primary rotation to primary translation. This transition can be readily appreciated by palpating the condyle of the mandible during the full opening of the mouth. The full amount of translation is large, about 1.5 to 2 cm in the adult.18,66 During the translation, the condyle and disc slide together in a forward and inferior direction against the slope of the articular eminence (see Fig. 11.16B). At the end of opening, the axis of rotation shifts inferiorly. The exact point of the axis is difficult to define because it depends on the person’s unique rotation-totranslation ratio. At the later phase of opening, the axis is usually located below the neck of the mandible.Full opening of the mouth maximally stretches and pulls the disc anteriorly. The extent of the forward translation (protrusion) is limited, in part, by tension in the stretched, elastic superior retrodiscal lamina. The intermediate region of the disc translates forward while remaining between the superior aspect of the condyle and the articular eminence. This placement of the disc maximizes joint congruency and reduces intra-articular stress\nThe arthrokinematics of closing the mouth occur in the reverse order of that described for opening. When the mouth is fully opened and prepared to close, tension in the superior retrodiscal lamina starts to retract the disc, helping to initiate the early translational phase of closing. The later phase is dominated by rotation of the condyle within the concavity of the disc, terminated when contact is made between the upper and lower teeth.”"

The superficial surface of the muscle is covered by and partially adhered to a relatively thick sheet of fascia, which limits the ease of palpating the belly of the muscle. From its cranial attachment, the temporalis forms a broad tendon that narrows distally as it passes through a space formed between the zygomatic arch and the lateral side of the skull (see Fig. 11.5). The muscle attaches distally to the coronoid process and to the anterior edge and medial surface of the ramus of the mandible (see Fig. 11.2). Bilateral contractions of the temporalis muscles elevate the mandible, producing a very effective biting force.91 The more oblique posterior fibers elevate and retrude the mandible. Similar to the masseter, the temporalis courses slightly medially as its approaches its distal attachment. Unilateral contraction of the temporalis, therefore, as when chewing in a side-to-side manner, causes slight ipsilateral excursion of the mandible (see Fig. 11.18). As explained for the masseter, the effectiveness of the temporalis for producing ipsilateral excursion is enhanced when the muscle is activated from a position of contralateral excursiona natural, cyclic kinematic pattern used while chewing.”2\n\n\n\n\nPalpation\nTemporalis is a thin sheet so use light pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Significance\n\n1.

The considerably larger inferior head arises from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and adjoining region of the maxilla. As a whole, the lateral pterygoid muscle traverses nearly horizontally to insert into a region of the neck of the mandible, very near the joint (review Fig. 11.10).4,27,28,77,99 Although the specific anatomic details are debated,14 the superior head of the lateral pterygoid shares attachments with the pterygoid fossa (see Fig. 11.2), the medial wall of the capsule, and the medial side of the”2\n\n\n\n\nPalpation\n\nIntraoral: debatable (Turp 2001)\n\nposterior up towards the mandibular neck\ncranial directed pressure underneath zygomatic arch (have subject protrude)\nAsk them to protrude w/ palpation\n\n\n\n\nClinical Significance\nPractically functions to stabilize the articular disc of the TMJ\nTears or excessive elongation of the lateral ligament may cause the disc to migrate medially by an unopposed pull of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle2\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "AKA\n\n\n\n\nRegression toward mediocrity\n\n\n\nRegression towards the mean (RTM) refers to the statistical tendency for extreme scores to move or regress toward the mean value with repeated measurements1. Regression of the mean can usually cause an underestimation of treatment effects due to greater potential for improvement in extreme scores in the control group. Regression toward the mean states that if a score deviates from the mean on one occasion, then a subsequent measurement will be closer to the average1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nPatients in control group have significantly higher pain scores at baseline compared to patients in experimental group Example of Selection & Regression of the mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nA study chooses participants whether they are above or below a cut-off score1.\nDue to measurement error\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\nAccording to measurement theory, the observed score (\\(X_o\\)) is the sum of the “True score” (\\(X_T\\)) and some error (\\(e\\)). Measurement error (\\(e\\)) of the instrument may cause some individuals to erroneously be considered outside of the cut-off point and individuals who truly fit the criteria and excluded. Simultaneously, (\\(e\\)) can cause individuals who do not truly meet the criteria to be erroneously scored an extreme score far from their mean and therefore included in the participants. Once the study begins and more data points are taken over time, these individuals who were improperly included will begin to “regress” towards their mean score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTrue score (\\(X_T\\)) refers to the score if there were no error. True score does not refer to the accuracy of the score.\n\n\n\n\nFactors affecting RTM\n\nReliability: The less reliable the scale, the greater the RTM1\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\n\\(T_2\\): Predicted score at time 2\n\\(r\\): Test retest reliability\n\\(T_1\\): Score at time 1\n(\\(T_1 - \\overline{X}\\)): How much a score deviates from the mean\n\n\n\\[\nT_2 = \\overline{X} + r(T_1 - \\overline{X})\n\\]\nHow to interpret this result:\n\nThis does not indicate that a score will change1\nThis calculation shows the magnitude that RTM can affect the results1\n\n\n\nResources\n\nTo read more about RTM see: Streiner (2001) Regression toward the mean: its etiology, diagnosis, and treatment2\nDeep dive: Campbell (1999) A PRIMER ON REGRESSION ARTIFACTS3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Genetic studies of individuals with adult-onset FALS have determined that about 20% of these individuals have mutations in SOD1; however, the primary gene defect is unknown.

I’d recommend practicing stalling up high on the wave next to the white water while you wait for the close out section to stand up, then pump and get some speed and hit the lip at the right time and you’ll do an air. It’s all about timing. You want the lip to hit you forward toward the beach so you don’t go out the back of the wave. Having a super light board will help too because it’s very quick and lighter so it will go in the air easier."

    "section": "Chronological Movement analysis",
    "text": "Chronological Movement analysis\nPreparatory phase: The preparatory phase parallels the “approach phase” from Forsyth et al., (2018). In this phase, we assume the surfer is already standing on the surfboard and riding the wave. The preparatory phase begins before the surfer performs the bottom turn to perform the aerial (Forsyth et al 2018). The surfer must determine when he should time the initiation of the aerial as well as how much speed he should have. Based on these decisions, the surfer will either “pump” to increase speed or “stall” to decrease speed Once the surfer is at his/her desired speed, they will perform the bottom turn which will decide his/her initial trajectory up the wave and towards the “lip.” The surfer should keep their center of mass low and toward the board. As the surfer rides up towards the “lip” (the top of the breaking wave) they should keep their “toeside” rail (edge of the surfboard) submerged in order to increase depth of the “triple extension” movement, so they can launch into the air (Forsyth 2018).\n\nTake-off Phase\n\nThe movement phase includes both “take-off” and “airborne” phases in Forsyth’s 4 phase model of surfing aerials (Forsyth 2018).\nAs the surfer rides up the lip, the preparatory phase ends and the movement phase begins. The takeoff to airborne phase can be broken down into one mental idea: Compressing yourself and the board into the wave as if the wave was a spring, then “bouncing” off that spring into the air and away from the wave.\nTo “take-off” the surfer shifts their COM towards their back foot by performing hip and knee flexion in the lead leg and simultaneously extending the rear knee and plantar flexing the rear ankle.\n\nThis weight shift will raise the “nose” (Front end of the surfboard)\n\nThere is also a rotation component that is added to the extension moment.\n\nAs the surfer flexes his lead leg and extends his rear leg, he/she should be rotating away from the rear leg (relative external hip rotation) as well as contralateral rotation (away from the rear leg) at the spine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAccording to Forsyth et al., the surfer should “swing their arms upward and use the moment of the lip to accelerate him/herself upward and forward relative to the wave.”1 I agree that one should use trunk and UE momentum to propel themselves forward and upward, but I believe this result comes from multiple structures rotating away from the rear leg in the transverse and sagittal plane, rather than swinging your arms upward in the sagittal plane.\n\n\n\n\nAirborne Phase\nOnce the surfer has left the wave, the airborne phase has begun\n\nOnce the surfer has left the surface of the wave, they should perform hip flexion and knee flexion in order to bring their lower limbs toward their chest1.\nThis is done to allow the surfboard to carry momentum as well so it stays connected to the surfer’s feet.\nAlthough the board will be pushing off the wave with you after the previous action, there is nothing “gluing” the board to your feet\nThus, during the flight phase, the surfer needs to keep his/her COM and COG over the board.\nThis is accomplished by keeping one’s chest over the knees and extending the lower extremities into the board to maintain contact with the board until the landing phase.\nThis allows them to gain maximum elevation whilst ensuring they are prepared to land in a stable position\n\n\n\nLanding phase\nThe landing phase is the 4th and final phase described by Forsyth et al.,1\nThe recovery phase coincides with Forsyth’s final phase, the “landing phase” and begins when the surfboard makes contact with the wave (Forsyth 2018). In the last phase (airborne phase) the surfer was extending his/her lower extremities into the board to maintain contact In this phase, the surfer continues to extend at the hips and knees, not only to maintain contact witht he board, but also to increase the ROM of eccentric triple extension during the landing Increased ROM allows the surfer to absorb the vertical forces for a longer period of time The surfer should land with almost full extension, but careful not to place the knees into hyperextension. To absorb the vertical loads, the surfer will eccentrically move through triple extension. The surfer should lean their trunk over their lead knee in order to maintain his COM within his BOS. This brings their center of mass forward over the board in an attempt to successfully complete the maneuver Keeping the center of mass toward the front foot is important since the surfboard will be pushed forward by the wave, thus the surfer’s BOS will be moving anteriorly under a stationary COM during landing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt should benotd that Forsyth et al., identified 52 performance variables that likely contribute to successful or unsuccessful aerial performance (Forsyth 2018)."

During landing tasks, athletes aim to move through the greatest available range of joint motion in order to dampen the impact forces they experience27. This is typically characterised by athletes displaying a plantar flexed ankle at initial ground contact to enable the largest possible range of ankle joint motion during the subsequent landing thereby increasing the time over which the impact forces are absorbed\nResults of the present study, however, have shown that landing an aerial with the lead (front) ankle in a dorsiflexed position at initial board-wave contact, rather than a plantar flexed position, was significantly associated with a successful landing\nExplanation: This apparently contradictory finding can be explained by the need for a surfer to maintain contact with their surfboard throughout the final stages of the airborne phase and into the landing phase of the aerial manoeuvre 1\n\n\nRear ankle\n During the airborne phase, plantar flexion of the rear ankle would result in downward movement of the surfboard tail. As there is a need to maintain constant contact with the surfboard, this downward movement of the surfboard tail would assist in keeping the nose of the surfboard up, leaving the lead ankle in a dorsiflexed position 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRear ankle coupled movements\n\n\n\n“Dorsiflexing the ankle is also likely to be coupled with knee flexion, which would ensure the surfer’s total body centre of mass remains within their base of support, as well as over the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard”1\n\n\n\n\nBase of Support\n A wider base of support enhances stability when performing a discrete skill, and was also evident when landing aerials in surfing. A wide base of support provides a greater area over which a surfer’s total body centre of gravity can travel before generating a perturbing torque. This increased tolerance for error is particularly useful when trying to land on a largely unpredictable surface such as a wave. A wide stance also helps the surfer position their centre of mass closer to the centre of buoyance of the surfboard, as discussed below (see Critical Feature (iii)) 1\n\n\nCenter of Mass (COM)\nThe third clinical feature described by Forsyth (2018) was “Landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard”1\n was Due to the relative unpredictability of surfing and the open nature of a surfing environment, ensuring a surfer lands over the centre of their surfboard is essential to limit the effect of any unexpected perturbations, which might occur because of the changing water surface. Positioning the total body centre of mass directly above the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard reduces the potential to generate any destabilising torques31 during landing. The effect of not adhering to this critical feature was evident in the FS Air Reverse when athletes landed with their total body centre of mass over the nose of the surfboard, which was significantly associated with unsuccessful performance of the manoeuvre (see Table 4). 1\nQ3: What injuries may be associated or caused by repeating this motion? Why?\nThere is not much research on injuries due to repeated motion of this movement. The main risk of this movement is the landing that requires much power to absorb the landing while maintaining stability on an unstable surface. For these reasons, Forsyth found that there was an association between performing aerials and acute lower limb injury (Forsyth 2018).\n“When landing an aerial manoeuvre, surfers are required to absorb and arrest high forces and impact velocities as they fall from the air and make contact with the surface of the wave. A surfer’s ability to successfully perform and control these landings may influence the forces experienced across the lower limb joints” (Forsyth 2018)."

    "text": "The patient with Parkinson disease walks with a rigid trunk, reduced arm swing, slow and short steps, and a tendency for the knees to be flexed. The gait of patients with classical Parkinson disease differs from the gait of patients with the atypical parkinsonian syndromes, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Festination, a tendency for the patient to begin running after taking a few steps, may be present with classical Parkinson disease, but seldom with atypical Parkinson syndrome. The base of support is generally normal in early Parkinson disease but is often widened in atypical Parkinson disease, which is also often accompanied by impaired balance. Whereas a stoop is characteristic of classical Parkinson disease, patients with PSP walk quite erect. Early reduction of arm swing is more characteristic of classical Parkinson disease. This disease follows destruction of neurons of the substantia nigra. The parkinsonian syndromes are caused by more widespread lesions, some of which involve the lenticular nucleus1. \n1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Brazis PW, Masdeu JC, Biller J.

    "text": "Complex Central Origin Gait Disorders\nComplex gait disorders of central origin are less well characterized than the ones previously described. Nonetheless, they are probably more common, particularly in the elderly population. In some cases, they are caused by lesions of brainstem nuclei. Some others are due to damage of the control loop that begins in the paracentral cortex and PMC and projects to the putamen. Through direct and indirect pathways, modified by input from the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus, the putamen projects to the medial globus pallidus, which inhibits the activity of thalamic neurons in the ventrolateral and ventral anterior nuclei. These thalamic nuclei send facilitatory projections to the frontal cortex. This loop probably plays an important role in mediating overlearned, unconscious motor activity that runs in the background, such as gait and postural reflexes. Patients with lesions in this loop can markedly improve their gait by paying attention to it. They have a faulty “automatic pilot” for postural reflexes. Finally, other gait disorders result from direct dysfunction of the cortex in the posterior portion of the medial frontal region.\n\nCautious Gait"
