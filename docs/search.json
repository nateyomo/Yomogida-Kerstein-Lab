No difference between groups by day 28. Number of capillaries per fiber and the number of capillaries per mm^2 at 28 day post injury did not differ between groups Day 7: centrally nucleated regenerating mm fibers present in sham, only a few in icing group Percentage of regenerating fibers relative to number of fibers was greater in the icing group than in sham 28 d post injury and no difference at 7 days.\nAnswer: Compared to sham, Icing attenuated and/or delayed neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, expression of vWF, VEGF and nestin, and change in vessel volume within muscle 7 days after injury. Icing did not influence capillary density in mm 28 days post injury. The percentage of immature myofibers relative to the total number of fibers was greater in the icing group than sham 28 d after injury.

Familial ALS is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous1.\nMost cases of FALS are autosomal dominant1. Regardless, recessive and X-linked forms have been described1. For example, the rare juvenileonset ALS is reported to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern1.\n\n3.3.1 FALS Categorization\nFALS is categorized by mode of inheritance and further subcategorized by specific gene or chromosomal locus@osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.\nThe very large majority of adult individuals with ALS have no family history of the disease (sporadic ALS)1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA very small percentage of individuals with sporadic ALS do have a mutation in SOD1\n\n\nOver 20 chromosomal regions and a number of identified genes have been linked to ALS. 20% of hereditary ALS cases are attributed to one of 100+ mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)1. ~50% of individuals with an SOD1 ALS variant are symptomatic by 46yrs, and 90% are symptomatic by 70 years of age1."

    "text": "4.1 Sensory Pathway\n\n\n\nTrigeminal Sensory System Nuclei and Pathways (from Blumenfeld figure 12.81)\n\n\n\nSomatosensory afferent nerves convey crude touch, pain, and temperature sensation from the face and mouth to the lateral pons1.\nThese nerve fibers then descend the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus1.\n. Similarly, the spinal trigeminal tract is analogous to Lissauer’s tract (see Figures 6.4 and 7.2). Secondary sensory neurons from the spinal trigeminal nucleus cross the brainstem to ascend as the trigeminothalamic tract (or ventral trigeminothalamic tract). The trigeminothalamic tract is analogous to the spinothalamic tract (see Table 12.6), and the pathways travel together to the thalamus (see Figures 12.8 and 14.3). Trigeminothalamic tract fibers synapse in the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), and tertiary sensory neurons then travel in the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex. Like the anterolateral systems in the spinal cord, there are also pathways from the spinal trigeminal nucleus to intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the reticular formation, and other areas, to mediate the affective and arousal aspects of facial pain.\n\nIn summary, it is generally believed that sensory fibers involved in the conduction of pain and temperature spread over the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and then cross over to the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex4"

The superficial surface of the muscle is covered by and partially adhered to a relatively thick sheet of fascia, which limits the ease of palpating the belly of the muscle. From its cranial attachment, the temporalis forms a broad tendon that narrows distally as it passes through a space formed between the zygomatic arch and the lateral side of the skull (see Fig. 11.5). The muscle attaches distally to the coronoid process and to the anterior edge and medial surface of the ramus of the mandible (see Fig. 11.2). Bilateral contractions of the temporalis muscles elevate the mandible, producing a very effective biting force.91 The more oblique posterior fibers elevate and retrude the mandible. Similar to the masseter, the temporalis courses slightly medially as its approaches its distal attachment. Unilateral contraction of the temporalis, therefore, as when chewing in a side-to-side manner, causes slight ipsilateral excursion of the mandible (see Fig. 11.18). As explained for the masseter, the effectiveness of the temporalis for producing ipsilateral excursion is enhanced when the muscle is activated from a position of contralateral excursiona natural, cyclic kinematic pattern used while chewing.”2\n\n\n\n\n6 Palpation\nTemporalis is a thin sheet so use light pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Clinical Significance\n\n1.

    "text": "In human skin, for example, there exist nociceptors that respond only to mechanical, only to cold thermal, or only to hot thermal stimuli as well as those that are insensitive to both mechanical and heat stimuli (mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors)1\nThe most abundant is the polymodal nociceptor, which responds to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. In general, nociceptors that innervate skin have the broadest range of modality selectivity1\nnociceptors innervating deeper structures tend to be less modality-selective and more polymodal in character. For example, mechanical sensitivity is a prominent feature of visceral and joint nociceptors because stimuli adequate for their activation include hollow organ distension and overrotation, respectively1.\nMany of these nociceptors also respond to chemical and/or thermal stimuli as well, although the functional significance of thermal sensitivity in deep tissues is uncertain1.\nAn important characteristic of polymodal nociceptors, whether the modalities of stimulation to which they respond are two or all three, is that when sensitized (e.g., by an inflammatory insult), responses to the other modality or modalities of stimuli to which it responds are all increased\n\n1 Mechanosensitivity\nNociceptors with low mechanical thresholds for response and those with very high mechanical thresholds for response (i.e., sleeping nociceptors) are both clinically important.\nMechanosensitive sensory neurons with low thresholds for response have long been classified as “non-nociceptors” (because it was considered that nociceptors had to have response thresholds in the noxious range)1.\nSome mechanosensitive skin, joint, and many visceral sensory neurons have low thresholds for response (i.e., in the nonnoxious range) but possess characteristics that suggest an important role in pain.\n\nFirst: these low-threshold receptors encode stimulus intensity well into the noxious range and, moreover, typically give greater responses to all intensities of stimulation than do nociceptors with high mechanical thresholds for response1.\nSecond: they sensitize after tissue insult. Unlike nociceptors with low mechanical thresholds, mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors normally provide no information to the central nervous system but after tissue insult become spontaneously active and mechanosensitive1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "1 Definition\nPain associated with cancer includes pain associated with disease progression as well as treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) that may damage the nervous system. Although some contend that pain associated with neoplastic disease is unique, in the majority of instances, we view it as fitting within our description of acute and chronic pain, as depicted in Figure 2.1. Moreover, pain associated with cancer can have multiple causes, namely, disease progression, treatment, and co-occurring diseases (e.g., arthritis). Regardless of whether the pain associated with cancer stems from disease progression, treatment, or a cooccurring disease, it may be either acute or chronic. Thus, we do not advocate a separate classification of cancer pain as distinct from acute and chronic pain. Some concerns have also been raised regarding the common usage of chronic malignant and chronic benign pain4; often, pain unrelated to cancer is implicitly view as “benign” to distinguish it from cancer-related pain. Certainly, people who have pain associated with neoplastic disease experience a unique and disease-specific situation, but from a mechanistic perspective, there may be little to substantiate continued use of this dichotomy. Moreover, patients who have chronic noncancer pain who are told that their pain is “benign” may feel denigrated because, from their perspective, the inference is that their pain is not a serious concern.1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Episodic or intermittent occurrences of pain, with each episode lasting for a relatively short period of time but recurring across an extended period of time (e.g., migraine headaches, tic douloureux, sickle cell crisis, dysmenorrhea). Our distinction between acute and chronic pain using the integration of the dimensions of time and pathology does not specifically include recurrent pain. In the case of recurrent pain, patients may experience episodes of pain interspersed with periods of being completely pain-free. Although recurrent pain may seem acute because each pain episode (e.g., headache) is of relatively short duration, the pathophysiology of many recurrent pain disorders (e.g., migraine) is not well understood. Syndromes characterized by recurrent acute pain share features in common with both acute and chronic pain. The fact that these syndromes extend over time, however, suggests that psychosocial and behavioral factors, not only physical pathology, may be major contributors to emotional and behavioral responses. IASP4 now includes recurrent pain lasting longer than 3 months within its definition of chronic pain. However, it is not clear whether multiple episodes lasting several days within 3 months would meet the chronic pain criterion or whether the pain must last at least 3 months. That is, would multiple migraines in a 3-month period be chronic even if there were pain-free periods within the 3 month period?1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Ballantyne J, Fishman S, Rathmell JP, eds.

The articular surface of the fossa is formed by the articular eminence, occupying the sloped anterior wall of the fossa (see Figs. 11.5 and 11.10). The articular eminence functions as a load-bearing surface and therefore consists of thick compact bone, lined with fibrocartilage. Full opening of the mouth requires that each condyle slides forward across the articular eminence.56 Excessive shear and compression at this interface may eventually cause fragmentation of the fibrocartilage, a common indicator of early degenerative arthritis at the TMJ. The slope of the articular eminence is, on average, 55 degrees from the horizontal plane.36 The steepness of the slope partially determines the kinematic path of the condyle during opening and closing of the mouth. The nonarticular surface of the mandibular fossa consists of a very thin layer of bone and fibrocartilage that occupies much of the superior (dome) and posterior walls of the fossa (see Fig. 11.5). According to Okeson,77 this thin region is not an adequate loadbearing surface. A large upward force applied to the chin can fracture this region of the fossa, possibly even sending bone fragments into the cranium."

The much larger deep head attaches on the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone (see Figs. 11.5 and 11.6). The smaller superficial head attaches to a region of the posterior side of the maxilla, just above the third molar (compare perspectives of Figs. 11.6 and 11.7).99 Both heads course nearly parallel with the masseter muscle and attach on the internal surface of the ramus, near the angle of the mandible (compare perspectives of Figs. 11.2 and 11.4). The actions of the two heads of the medial pterygoid are essentially identical. Acting bilaterally, the medial pterygoid elevates and, to a limited extent, protrudes the mandible. Because of the oblique line of force of the muscle, a unilateral contraction of the medial pterygoid produces a very effective contralateral excursion of the mandible”2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction between Medial pterygoid and masseter\n\n\n\n“T he medial pterygoid and masseter muscles form a functional sling around the angle of the mandible (Fig. 11.20). Simultaneous contractions of these muscles can exert a powerful biting force that is directed through the jaw and ultimately between the upper and lower molars.57 The maximal biting force in this region averages about 422 N (95 lb) in the adult, twice that generated between the incisors.61 Acting on the internal and external sides of the mandible, the masseter and medial pterygoid also produce an important sideto-side force between the upper and lower molars. As shown in Fig. 11.18, simultaneous contraction of the right medial pterygoid and left masseter produces left lateral deviation. Contraction of these muscles in this synergistic fashion can produce a very effective shear force between the molars and food, on both sides of the mouth. The combined muscular action is very effective at grinding and crushing food before swallowing.articular disc. The inferior head attaches within the pterygoid fossa and adjacent neck of the mandible. A third head of the muscle has also been proposed, based on the multiple pattern of distal attachments.”\n“The precise action and role of the two heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle during mastication is controversial and not completely understood.74,106 The lack of understanding partially reflects the muscle’s deep location and subsequent technical challenge to electromyographic study. It is generally agreed, however, that unilateral contraction of both heads of the lateral pterygoid produces contralateral excursion of the mandible (see Fig. 11.18). Furthermore, unilateral muscle contraction rotates the ipsilateral condyle anterior-medially within the horizontal plane—a typical kinematic component of contralateral excursion (reviewed in Fig 11.14B). Usually a given right or left lateral pterygoid muscle contracts synergistically with other muscles during mastication. For example, as depicted in Fig. 11.18, a biting motion that involves left lateral excursion is controlled by the right lateral and medial pterygoid muscles and, to a lesser extent, by the left masseter and temporalis.”\n“Bilateral contraction of both heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle produces a strong protrusion of the mandible.61 As fully described ahead in the discussion of muscular control of opening and closing of the mouth, the two heads of the lateral pterygoid are active at different phases of opening and closing of the mouth. (For this and other morphologic considerations, some authors have argued that the two heads of the lateral pterygoid are actually separate muscles.28) Most sources suggest that the inferior head is the primary depressor of the mandible, especially during resisted opening of the mouth.65,74,77,82 The superior head, in contrast, helps control the tension within the disc and its position during resisted closure of the jaw.65,74 This action is especially important during resisted, unilateral closure of the jaw, such as when biting down on a hard piece of candy.”\n\n\n\n\n6 Palpation\nIntraoral: Posterior and medial to mandibular molars (have subject deviate away)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Clinical Significance\n\n1.

In this exercise, one will have a leg on the ground (stance leg) and another leg in the air. Both shoulders will remain on the ground the whole time. As an example, we will imagine an individual using their R leg as the stance leg. Since both shoulders are stationary, the weight of the pelvis and raised leg (L) will add a load d/t gravity that pulls the L hip towards the ground, resulting in relative right rotation. Thus, in order to keep the pelvis level, one must perform active left rotation using the R multifidus since the multifidi perform C/L rotation unilaterally. An easy way to remember which multifid you are recruiting during S/L bridge is that the multifidi on the same side as the stance leg is being recruited."

Then the results are measured using dependent variables\nAn odds ratio compares two groups of people who only differ based on exposure. You could think of exposure as the “independent variable.” When viewing the results, you could view the exposure rates as the “dependent variables.” Thus when comparing the two using an odds ratio, you are trying to ascertain whether the exposure was statistically significant in outcome rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Practical use:\n\nOdds ratios commonly are used to report case-control studies\n\n\n\n3 Calculation\n\nThe odds ratio (OR) is a measure of how strongly an event is associated with exposure.\nOR = odds that a case was exposed / Odds that a control was exposed\nThe odds ratio is a ratio of two sets of odds: the odds of the event occurring in an exposed group versus the odds of the event occurring in a non-exposed group\n\n\n\n\n\nDisease (Case)\nNo Disease (Control)\n\n\n\n\nExposed\nA\nB\n\n\nUnexposed\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Interpretation\n\n\n\n\nOR Value\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n&lt;1\nOdds of disease lower with exposed than non-exposed\n\n\n1\nNo difference in odds of disease\n\n\n&gt;1\nOdds of disease greater in exposed than non-exposed\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The patient received natural and synthetic antibiotics and steroids to resolve the acute signs of infection, but this did not yield any functional improvement2. Rongies et al., found full and rapid resolution of extraocular paralysis and diploplia using periorbital hydrocortisone iontophoresis, visuomotor exercises combined with intense ideomotor stimulation2.\nInterventions\n\nIontophoresis\n\nIontophoretic treatment of various ophthalmic conditions2.\nUsed as a means of noninvasive, transdermal drug delivery\nPerformed in the orbital region affected by extraocular muscle palsy ( The selected technique of ocular iontophoresis was indirect, through a closed eyelid)2.\nDrug: Corhydron 100 [hydrocortisone] at 50 mg/5mL of a sodium chloride solution as a solvent2.\nThe procedure used direct (or galvanic) current.\nDuration of each single iontophoresis procedure was 20 minutes2\nPt position: Upright sitting position with head and forearms supported (to enable observation of autonomic nervous system related adverse effects)2.\n\nExercise\n\nExercise performed immediately after iontophoresis2.\n30-minute set of PT supervised exercises2.\nBreaks\n\nAllowed if: 1. Pt reported feeling of muscle fatigue or 2. distinct deceleration of eyeball movements was observed\nFrequency of breaks: gradually decreased from every several seconds to every 2 minutes\n\nExercise Type: Attempts to follow with the gaze an object (patient’s hand) moving diagonally in space (in alternate pattern), with additional simultaneous ideomotor stimulation2.\nThe amplitude of movement progressively increased during the rehabilitation sessions. The patient performed his exercises in sitting and standing positions positions which improved comfort by avoiding forced position. His head was still. Each exercise session was conducted in setting that limited the patient’s distraction. The patient was advised to perform these exercises at home 2-3 times a day. The outcome measures for this study were the range of eye movement, reaction times during eye movement and muscle endurance, in comparison with these in the unaffected eye. The results were evaluated visually by 3 independent researchers who were not involved in the process of treatment. The range of movement improvement has been documented in the picture.\n\nResults:\n\nRongies used daily physical therapy and the patient regained distinct movement within 4 days2.\nBy session 16, the patient displayed complete return of function in all paralyzed muscles2."

One should introduce the application of incrementally greater movements and loads or investigate VA flow using Doppler sonography or an magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) scan before performing a grade V technique in the cervical spine1.

If you need to stall up and wait for the section to start closing out. If you watch pros they’ll frequently stomp the tail and wait for the wave to wall up more, then pump down the line a few times before launching off the lip.\nAs far as how long it takes, it just depends on the person and I think more importantly age. I learned to surf around 8-10 and didn’t learn to do a real air until 8th grade. So however long that is was my time taken. Im 30 now and still trying to learn how to do new grabs and rotations. Also, I think as a kid its a bit easier as you are trying to one up all your friends etc and have 8hr surf days and endless energy haha."

You don’t need super long waves, you just need the right section that throws a nice lip and you need to time it right. I’d recommend practicing stalling up high on the wave next to the white water while you wait for the close out section to stand up, then pump and get some speed and hit the lip at the right time and you’ll do an air. It’s all about timing. You want the lip to hit you forward toward the beach so you don’t go out the back of the wave. Having a super light board will help too because it’s very quick and lighter so it will go in the air easier."

    "section": "4.1 Chronological Movement analysis",
    "text": "4.1 Chronological Movement analysis\nPreparatory phase: The preparatory phase parallels the “approach phase” from Forsyth et al., (2018). In this phase, we assume the surfer is already standing on the surfboard and riding the wave. The preparatory phase begins before the surfer performs the bottom turn to perform the aerial (Forsyth et al 2018). The surfer must determine when he should time the initiation of the aerial as well as how much speed he should have. Based on these decisions, the surfer will either “pump” to increase speed or “stall” to decrease speed Once the surfer is at his/her desired speed, they will perform the bottom turn which will decide his/her initial trajectory up the wave and towards the “lip.” The surfer should keep their center of mass low and toward the board. As the surfer rides up towards the “lip” (the top of the breaking wave) they should keep their “toeside” rail (edge of the surfboard) submerged in order to increase depth of the “triple extension” movement, so they can launch into the air (Forsyth 2018).\n\n4.1.1 Take-off Phase\n\nThe movement phase includes both “take-off” and “airborne” phases in Forsyth’s 4 phase model of surfing aerials (Forsyth 2018).\nAs the surfer rides up the lip, the preparatory phase ends and the movement phase begins. The takeoff to airborne phase can be broken down into one mental idea: Compressing yourself and the board into the wave as if the wave was a spring, then “bouncing” off that spring into the air and away from the wave.\nTo “take-off” the surfer shifts their COM towards their back foot by performing hip and knee flexion in the lead leg and simultaneously extending the rear knee and plantar flexing the rear ankle.\n\nThis weight shift will raise the “nose” (Front end of the surfboard)\n\nThere is also a rotation component that is added to the extension moment.\n\nAs the surfer flexes his lead leg and extends his rear leg, he/she should be rotating away from the rear leg (relative external hip rotation) as well as contralateral rotation (away from the rear leg) at the spine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAccording to Forsyth et al., the surfer should “swing their arms upward and use the moment of the lip to accelerate him/herself upward and forward relative to the wave.”1 I agree that one should use trunk and UE momentum to propel themselves forward and upward, but I believe this result comes from multiple structures rotating away from the rear leg in the transverse and sagittal plane, rather than swinging your arms upward in the sagittal plane.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Airborne Phase\nOnce the surfer has left the wave, the airborne phase has begun\n\nOnce the surfer has left the surface of the wave, they should perform hip flexion and knee flexion in order to bring their lower limbs toward their chest1.\nThis is done to allow the surfboard to carry momentum as well so it stays connected to the surfer’s feet.\nAlthough the board will be pushing off the wave with you after the previous action, there is nothing “gluing” the board to your feet\nThus, during the flight phase, the surfer needs to keep his/her COM and COG over the board.\nThis is accomplished by keeping one’s chest over the knees and extending the lower extremities into the board to maintain contact with the board until the landing phase.\nThis allows them to gain maximum elevation whilst ensuring they are prepared to land in a stable position\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Landing phase\nThe landing phase is the 4th and final phase described by Forsyth et al.,1\nThe recovery phase coincides with Forsyth’s final phase, the “landing phase” and begins when the surfboard makes contact with the wave (Forsyth 2018). In the last phase (airborne phase) the surfer was extending his/her lower extremities into the board to maintain contact In this phase, the surfer continues to extend at the hips and knees, not only to maintain contact witht he board, but also to increase the ROM of eccentric triple extension during the landing Increased ROM allows the surfer to absorb the vertical forces for a longer period of time The surfer should land with almost full extension, but careful not to place the knees into hyperextension. To absorb the vertical loads, the surfer will eccentrically move through triple extension. The surfer should lean their trunk over their lead knee in order to maintain his COM within his BOS. This brings their center of mass forward over the board in an attempt to successfully complete the maneuver Keeping the center of mass toward the front foot is important since the surfboard will be pushed forward by the wave, thus the surfer’s BOS will be moving anteriorly under a stationary COM during landing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt should benotd that Forsyth et al., identified 52 performance variables that likely contribute to successful or unsuccessful aerial performance (Forsyth 2018)."

During landing tasks, athletes aim to move through the greatest available range of joint motion in order to dampen the impact forces they experience27. This is typically characterised by athletes displaying a plantar flexed ankle at initial ground contact to enable the largest possible range of ankle joint motion during the subsequent landing thereby increasing the time over which the impact forces are absorbed\nResults of the present study, however, have shown that landing an aerial with the lead (front) ankle in a dorsiflexed position at initial board-wave contact, rather than a plantar flexed position, was significantly associated with a successful landing\nExplanation: This apparently contradictory finding can be explained by the need for a surfer to maintain contact with their surfboard throughout the final stages of the airborne phase and into the landing phase of the aerial manoeuvre 1\n\n\n4.2.2 Rear ankle\n During the airborne phase, plantar flexion of the rear ankle would result in downward movement of the surfboard tail. As there is a need to maintain constant contact with the surfboard, this downward movement of the surfboard tail would assist in keeping the nose of the surfboard up, leaving the lead ankle in a dorsiflexed position 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRear ankle coupled movements\n\n\n\n“Dorsiflexing the ankle is also likely to be coupled with knee flexion, which would ensure the surfer’s total body centre of mass remains within their base of support, as well as over the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard”1\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Base of Support\n A wider base of support enhances stability when performing a discrete skill, and was also evident when landing aerials in surfing. A wide base of support provides a greater area over which a surfer’s total body centre of gravity can travel before generating a perturbing torque. This increased tolerance for error is particularly useful when trying to land on a largely unpredictable surface such as a wave. A wide stance also helps the surfer position their centre of mass closer to the centre of buoyance of the surfboard, as discussed below (see Critical Feature (iii)) 1\n\n\n4.2.4 Center of Mass (COM)\nThe third clinical feature described by Forsyth (2018) was “Landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard”1\n was Due to the relative unpredictability of surfing and the open nature of a surfing environment, ensuring a surfer lands over the centre of their surfboard is essential to limit the effect of any unexpected perturbations, which might occur because of the changing water surface. Positioning the total body centre of mass directly above the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard reduces the potential to generate any destabilising torques31 during landing. The effect of not adhering to this critical feature was evident in the FS Air Reverse when athletes landed with their total body centre of mass over the nose of the surfboard, which was significantly associated with unsuccessful performance of the manoeuvre (see Table 4). 1\nQ3: What injuries may be associated or caused by repeating this motion? Why?\nThere is not much research on injuries due to repeated motion of this movement. The main risk of this movement is the landing that requires much power to absorb the landing while maintaining stability on an unstable surface. For these reasons, Forsyth found that there was an association between performing aerials and acute lower limb injury (Forsyth 2018).\n“When landing an aerial manoeuvre, surfers are required to absorb and arrest high forces and impact velocities as they fall from the air and make contact with the surface of the wave. A surfer’s ability to successfully perform and control these landings may influence the forces experienced across the lower limb joints” (Forsyth 2018)."

Locomotor training using partial body weight support, a treadmill, and early assisted limb movements has also been shown to promote function induced recovery (see Chapter 10: Interventions to Improve Locomotor Skills and Case Study 3) The elements essential for success with these interventions are that (1) practice is task specific and (2) practice is intense, with steady increases in duration and frequency. For example, in CIMT, the patient with stroke practices grasping and manipulating objects during daily tasks using the more affected UE 4 to 6 hours per day, every day. The less-affected UE may be constrained with a mitt, thereby preventing all attempts at compensatory movements."

The articular surface of the fossa is formed by the articular eminence, occupying the sloped anterior wall of the fossa (see Figs. 11.5 and 11.10). The articular eminence functions as a load-bearing surface and therefore consists of thick compact bone, lined with fibrocartilage. Full opening of the mouth requires that each condyle slides forward across the articular eminence.56 Excessive shear and compression at this interface may eventually cause fragmentation of the fibrocartilage, a common indicator of early degenerative arthritis at the TMJ. The slope of the articular eminence is, on average, 55 degrees from the horizontal plane.36 The steepness of the slope partially determines the kinematic path of the condyle during opening and closing of the mouth. The nonarticular surface of the mandibular fossa consists of a very thin layer of bone and fibrocartilage that occupies much of the superior (dome) and posterior walls of the fossa (see Fig. 11.5). According to Okeson,77 this thin region is not an adequate loadbearing surface. A large upward force applied to the chin can fracture this region of the fossa, possibly even sending bone fragments into the cranium."

Slight multiplanar rotations are typically combined with lateral excursion. For example, Fig. 11.14B shows lateral excursion combined with a slight horizontal plane rotation.

    "text": "2.5 Depression & Elevation\n\n\n\nTMJ Depression and elevation (fig 11.151)\n\n\nOsteokinematics:\n\n“Depression of the mandible causes the mouth to open, a fundamental component of chewing (see Fig. 11.15A). Maximal opening of the mouth typically occurs during actions such as yawning and singing. In the adult the mouth can be opened an average of 45–50 mm as measured between the incisal edges of the upper and lower front teeth.18,43,97 T he interincisal opening is typically large enough to fit three adult “knuckles” (proximal interphalangeal joints). Typical mastication, however, requires an average maximal opening of 18 mm—about 38% of maximum (sufficient to accept one adult knuckle). Being unable to fit two knuckles between the edges of the upper and lower incisors is usually considered abnormal in the average sized adult. Elevation of the mandible closes the mouth—an action used to crush food during mastication (see Fig. 11.15B). During this process, the teeth within the elevating mandible strongly oppose the teeth within the fixed maxilla.”\n\nArthrokinematics:\n“Opening and closing of the mouth occur by depression and elevation of the mandible, respectively. During these movements, each TMJ experiences a combination of rotation and translation among the mandibular condyle, articular disc, and fossa. No other joint in the body experiences such a large proportion of translation and rotation. These complex arthrokinematics are a necessary mechanical component of mastication (grinding and crushing of food) and for speaking. Because rotation and translation occur simultaneously, the axis of rotation is constantly moving. In the ideal case the movements within both TMJs result in a maximal range of mouth opening with minimal stress placed on the articular surfaces.”\n\nEarly phase:\n\nfirst 35-50% of ROM1\n\n\n\n“The early phase, constituting the first 35% to 50% of the range of motion, involves primarily rotation of the mandible relative to the cranium. As depicted in Fig. 11.16A, the condyle rolls posteriorly within the concave inferior surface of the disc. (The direction of the roll is described relative to the rotation of a point on the ramus of the mandible.) The rolling motion swings the body of the mandible inferiorly and posteriorly. The axis of rotation for this motion is not fixed but migrates within the vicinity of the mandibular neck and condyle.32,77,83 The rolling motion of the condyle stretches the oblique portion of the lateral ligament, which may help initiate the late phase of opening the mouth”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is likely not possible to define a single rotation-to-translation kinematic of the TMJ during opening/closing due to natural intersubject variability in movement strategy and on overall cranial-dental anatomy1\n\n\n“The late phase of opening the mouth consists of the final 50% to 65% of the total range of motion. This phase is marked by a gradual transition from primary rotation to primary translation. This transition can be readily appreciated by palpating the condyle of the mandible during the full opening of the mouth. The full amount of translation is large, about 1.5 to 2 cm in the adult.18,66 During the translation, the condyle and disc slide together in a forward and inferior direction against the slope of the articular eminence (see Fig. 11.16B). At the end of opening, the axis of rotation shifts inferiorly. The exact point of the axis is difficult to define because it depends on the person’s unique rotation-totranslation ratio. At the later phase of opening, the axis is usually located below the neck of the mandible.Full opening of the mouth maximally stretches and pulls the disc anteriorly. The extent of the forward translation (protrusion) is limited, in part, by tension in the stretched, elastic superior retrodiscal lamina. The intermediate region of the disc translates forward while remaining between the superior aspect of the condyle and the articular eminence. This placement of the disc maximizes joint congruency and reduces intra-articular stress\nThe arthrokinematics of closing the mouth occur in the reverse order of that described for opening. When the mouth is fully opened and prepared to close, tension in the superior retrodiscal lamina starts to retract the disc, helping to initiate the early translational phase of closing. The later phase is dominated by rotation of the condyle within the concavity of the disc, terminated when contact is made between the upper and lower teeth.”"

    "text": "3.4 Test-Retest Reliability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest-Retest reliability reflects the variation in measurements taken by an instrument on the same subject under the same conditions1. In other words, Test-Retest reliability quantifies the similarity of scores when a study participant completes a test at 2 separate instances2. If this test was reliable, we would expect the 2 scores to be similar, if not identical, on both occasions (assuming that the person has not changed in the interim)2.\nUse case:\n\nIt is generally indicative of reliability in situations when raters are not involved or rater effect is neglectable, such as self-report survey instrument1.\n\nDuration between tests:\n\nWhen assessing test-retest reliability, the length of time between time 1 and 2 creates an issue since there is a fine balance the researchers must find with time since there is trade-off between 2 competing requirements2.\nIf the duration is too short, the participants will answer the questionnaire by memory in order to appear consistent2.\nIf the duration is too long, the person’s mood, anxiety, symptoms, or whatever we are measuring could change2.\nThe usual testretest interval is about 2 weeks, but this can be altered based on a number of factors2.\nThe Longer the scale the less time is required between measurements (the person is less likely to remember all of their answers)2.\nDuration is also determined by how quickly the attribute being tested can change2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if my scale has low Test-Retest Reliability?\n\n\n\n\nA self administered scale with poor test-retest reliability cannot be changed without altering psychometric validity2\nA clinician-administered scale can be slightly changed by insuring that the instructions are clear and understood by the participant2"

Patients may have photo- and phonosensitivity,4 but fever and meningismus may be mild or absent.8 Analysis of the CSF demonstrates a lymphocytic pleocytosis, a mildly increased protein concentration, and a normal glucose concentration. Papilledema due to intracranial hypertension has been reported in children with Lyme meningitis and may rarely occur in adults."

Moreover, itmay indicate the ability of an experimental method to detect and measure systematic differences between subjects. This ability islimited since those differences may be more or less masked by individual variations of"

Practically, this model is rarely used in clinical reliability analysis because majority of the reliability studies typically involve the same set of raters to measure all subjects. An exception would be multicenter studies for which the physical distance between centers prohibits the same set of raters to rate all subjects. Under such circumstance, one set of raters may assess a subgroup of subjects in one center and another set of raters may assess a subgroup of subjects in another center, and hence, 1-way random-effects model should be used in this case."

Otherwise, we would have a measure of the degree to which 1 person can accurately copy from another, which tells us much about the raters, but little about the subject.\nTests for Inter-Rater Reliability\n\nTotal Agreement: Percentage of examinations in which the task scores assigned by the two raters were identical (total agreement)2\nCohen’s Kappa: The chance corrected measure of agreement on tasks\nKrippendorff’s Alpha\n\nHas the advantage of high flexibility regarding the measurement scale and the number of raters, and, unlike Fleiss’ K, can also handle missing values3.\n\nPearson’s coefficients: Of the correlation between the two raters’ scores for each subscale\nT-Tests: between the two raters’ mean scores for the each subscale\nIntraclass Correlation Coefficient\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Poor Interrater reliability\n\n\n\n\nIf 1 rater gives a score of 7 and another a score of 12, we wouldn’t be sure which, if either, score is correct1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do with poor inter-rater reliability\n\n\n\nHow to improve inter-rater reliability: - The solution is usually more training of the raters1 - A common strategy is for raters to independently evaluate about 10 people who will not be part of the final sample, and to discuss why they disagreed on specific items; were the criteria unclear, ambiguous, poorly stated, or whatever? - This is repeated on a new group until satisfactory inter-rater reliability is achieved - If the study lasts more than a few months, it is usually a good idea to evaluate inter-rater reliability toward the middle to see if there has been any slippage in the level of agreement. - Problems exist with this method if thescale requires interviewing the subject1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.
