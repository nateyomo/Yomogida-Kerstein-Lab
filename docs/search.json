Locomotor training using partial body weight support, a treadmill, and early assisted limb movements has also been shown to promote function induced recovery (see Chapter 10: Interventions to Improve Locomotor Skills and Case Study 3) The elements essential for success with these interventions are that (1) practice is task specific and (2) practice is intense, with steady increases in duration and frequency. For example, in CIMT, the patient with stroke practices grasping and manipulating objects during daily tasks using the more affected UE 4 to 6 hours per day, every day. The less-affected UE may be constrained with a mitt, thereby preventing all attempts at compensatory movements."

    "text": "The 3dimensional hip flexor stretch is an exercise inspired by the Gray Institute1.\nStart in a split stance with the lead (contralateral) leg elevated on a box. The rear leg is considered “ipsilateral” since this is the set of hip flexors we are targeting with this stretch. Internally rotate the ipsilateral leg so the toes are pointing medially.\nNext we will perform 3 sets of movements to stretch the hip flexors in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.\n\nSagittal plane\nTo stretch the hip flexors in the sagittal plane, we will use momentum and swing the arms into extension, the core into flexion, and the hips into flexion.\nThen we will move in the opposite direction with the arms leading. This will end with the arms in full flexion, the trunk in extension, and the hips in extension which will place a stretch on the hip flexors in the sagittal plane.\n\n\nFrontal Plane\nTo stretch the hip flexors in the frontal plane, we will start with our arms raised above our heads. We will swing our arms towards the ipsilateral side, resultibng in ipsilateral sidebend, and hip abduction.\nThen we will move the opposite way and swing our arms to the contralateral side, resulting in contralateral sidebend, and hip adduction of the ipsilateral hip.\n\n\nTransverse plane\nStart with your arms flexed to 90° in front of you. Use your arms as a driver to rotate contralaterally. A chain reaction will occur that results in trunk contralateral rotation and external rotation of the ipsilateral hip.\nMove the opposite way, to create trunk ipsilateral rotation and internal rotation of the ipsilateral hip.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Icing did not influence capillary density in mm 28 days post injury. The percentage of immature myofibers relative to the total number of fibers was greater in the icing group than sham 28 d after injury.

The faster the rate of the stretch, the stronger the neurological signal sent from the muscle spindle, and as a result, the greater the efferent muscle contraction (the shortening cycle of the plyometric movement). The other mechanoreceptor that plays a significant role in the plyometric stretch-shorten cycle is the GTO. The function of the GTO is to act as a protective reflex preventing over-contraction or too much tension in the muscle. Thus, the GTO assists with modulating forces during plyometric exercises. Consequently, the purpose of plyometric training is to increase the excitability of the neurologic receptors for improved reactivity of the neuromuscular system while desensitizing the GTO.66-69 Explosive plyometric exercises may improve the neural efficiency through enhancement of neuromuscular coordi-"

This pass requires great attention to detail. You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work. This pass can take about four or five hours for beginners, and about an hour for an experienced reader. At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.”1"

Festination, a tendency for the patient to begin running after taking a few steps, may be present with classical Parkinson disease, but seldom with atypical Parkinson syndrome. The base of support is generally normal in early Parkinson disease but is often widened in atypical Parkinson disease, which is also often accompanied by impaired balance. Whereas a stoop is characteristic of classical Parkinson disease, patients with PSP walk quite erect. Early reduction of arm swing is more characteristic of classical Parkinson disease. This disease follows destruction of neurons of the substantia nigra.

For example, walking on an icy street may force normal individuals to adopt a similar gait pattern to minimize the risk of falling1.\n\n\n\n\nClinical Presentation\nThis gait disorder is seen mainly in older people. It may represent a milder or compensatory phase of any of the disorders causing poor balance and is not localizing1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Brazis PW, Masdeu JC, Biller J.

    "text": "FORWARD AND BACKWARD WALKING The patient practices walking forward and backward as a progression from high-stepping. The therapist focuses on appropriate timing and sequencing, beginning with the weight shift forward and diagonally or backward and diagonally with weight acceptance onto the stance limb. The movements are repeated to allow for a continuous movement sequence.\nManual contacts can be used to guide movements and facilitate missing elements. For example, in the presence of a retracted and elevated pelvis (a problem that exists for many patients with stroke and LE spasticity), the therapist can facilitate anterior pelvic elevation during swing by placing the hands on the lateral, superior, and slightly anterior aspect of the pelvis. For backward progression, the therapist’s hand can be placed over the gluteal muscles and posterior thigh to facilitate hip extension. Approximation through the pelvis can be used to facilitate weight acceptance on the stance limb. This also helps to prevent the knee on the stance limb from hyperextending. For forward progression VCs include “Shift forward, and step” and for backward progression, “Shift backward, and step.”\n\nProgression\nTo progress the activity of walking forward and backward, the therapist can do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManual Facilitation\n\nDecrease the amount of manual facilitation, placing increasing demands on active control\n\n\n\nEnvironment\n\nAlter the environment by progressing from walking in parallel bars, to next to parallel bars or a wall, to overground walking (i.e., decrease level of assistance)\nAlter the environment by (1) varying the walking surface from flat to carpeted to irregular (outdoors), (2) including anticipatory timing demands, such as the time required to cross a street at a stoplight, and (3) including goal-directed leisure or occupational requirements (return-to-work skills)\n\n\n\nStep Length\n\nIncrease the step length from initially reduced to normal\n\n\n\n\n\nCadence\n\nChange the speed of walking from initially reduced, to normal, to an increased pace\n\n\n\nAcceleration / Deceleration\n\nVary the acceleration or deceleration by having the patient practice stopping and starting or turning on cue\n\n\n\nBOS\n\nModify the BOS from feet apart (wide base), to normal, to feet close together (narrow base), to tandem walking (heel-to-toe pattern).

The stride cycle is contains all motions/events that occur between the same event occuring twice on one side. Generally, it is categorized from ground contact on one foot to ground contact again on the same foot1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGait patterns use the term “heel strike,” but in running, the term “ground contact” or “foot strike” is used since initial contact can occur at the rearfoot, midfoot, or forefoot1\n\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n\nABCD Motions\n\nB Motion\n\n\n\nABCD Drills\n\n“Aside from strength training, how can one improve running form and performance? Because running involves a neuromuscular component, running form can be improved through specific form drills that coordinate the movements of the involved parts of the anatomy. The drills, developed by coach Gerard Mach in the 1950s, are simple and cause little impact stress. Essentially, these drills, commonly referred to as the ABCs of running, isolate the phases of the gait cycle: knee lift, upper leg motion, and push-off. By isolating each phase and slowing the movement, the drills, when properly performed, develop the runner’s kinesthetic sense, promote neuromuscular response, and aid in strength development. A properly performed drill should lead to proper running form because the drill becomes the running performance—just at a faster velocity. Originally, these drills were designed for sprinters, but they can be used by all runners. They should be performed once or twice per week and can be completed in 15 minutes. Focus on proper form.”2\n\nA Motion\n\n\n\n3 forms of A Motion2\n\n\n“The A motion (figure 1.2a, b, and c) is propelled by the hip flexors and quadriceps. The movement can be performed either while walking or, more dynamically, as the A skip or A run. The movement involves knee flexion and forward rotation of the pelvis (figure 1.2c). Meanwhile, the arm carriage is simple and balances the action of the lower body rather than propelling it. The arm on the opposite side of the raised leg is bent 90 degrees at the elbow; it swings forward and back like a pendulum while the shoulder joint acts as a fulcrum. The other arm moves simultaneously in the opposite direction. Both hands should be held loosely at the wrist joints and should not be raised above shoulder level. Emphasize driving down the swing leg, which initiates the knee lift of the other leg.”2\nA Walk (drill) A Skip (drill) A run (drill)\n\n\nB Motion\n\n\n\n3 forms of B Motion2\n\n\n“The B motion (figure 1.3a, b, and c) depends on the quadriceps to extend the leg and the hamstrings to drive the leg toward the ground in preparation for the impact phase (figure 1.3c). In sequence, the quadriceps extend the leg from the position of the A motion to potential full extension, then the hamstrings group forcefully drives the lower leg and foot to the ground. During running, the tibialis anterior dorsiflexes the ankle, which positions the foot for the appropriate heel landing; however, dorsiflexion should be minimized in the B motion so that the foot lands closer to midstance. This precision reduces the impact experienced by the heel; in addition, because the biomechanics of the foot are less involved here than in running, this motion does not promote forefoot injury.”2\nB Walk (drill) B Skip (drill) B run (drill)\n\n\nC Motion\n\n\n\n2 forms of B Motion2\n\n\n“The final phase of the running gait cycle is dominated by the hamstrings (figure 1.4a and b). When the foot makes contact with the ground, the hamstrings continue to contract, not to limit the extension of the leg but to pull the foot upward, under the glutes, in order to begin another cycle. Accordingly, the emphasis of this exercise (figure 1.4b) is to pull the foot up, directly under the buttocks, thus shortening the arc and the duration of the phase so that another stride can be commenced. This exercise is performed rapidly, in staccato bursts. The arms swing quickly, mimicking the faster movement of the legs, and the hands come a little higher and closer to the body than in the A and B motions. This motion is also facilitated by a more pronounced forward lean of the torso, similar to the body position used in sprinting.”2\nC Walk (drill) C Skip (drill) C run (drill)\n\n\nD Drill\nD Walk (drill) D Skip (drill) D run (drill)\n\n\n\nShoes\n\nMinimalist Index"

    "text": "How triplanar pelvic position affects overall system tension. When pelvic pronation occurs, the trunk and pelvis spiral across 3 planes, moving the left side of the pelvis forward and downward toward the stable right lower extremity. The pelvic drop, coupled with this forward and downward motion, forces the right hip into adduction and internal rotation. As the left knee moves from a position of stability towards knee valgus the musculoskeletal tension throughout the entire system is now compromiseddischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019?\n\n\n The golf swing is an example of how system tension could affect the lower extremity. Consider a golfer preparing to strike a ball. As the backswing is completed, the left hip and knee maintain alignment with trunk positioning and stability (arrows in panel A of the FIGURE), which in turn maintains system tension (represented here by an imaginary rubber band wrapped around the golfer)dischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019?.\nThe rubber band represents the interconnected muscular pathways coursing through the anterior and posterior kinetic chainsdischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019?.

    "text": "Hoover’s sign is considered positive if there is weakness of hip extension (left) which returns to normal with contralateral hip flexion against resistance (right)1.\n\n\n\nPurpose\nA clinician can check for Hoover’s sign in order to differentaite between general hip extension weakness and functional hip extension weakness.\n\n\nTechnique\nassuming the L hip is demonstrating weakness\n\nPatient goes into hip extension against resistance with L leg\nTest patient’s ability to perform resisted hip flexion on the right leg which indirectly tests hip extension on the left leg.\nIf the patient has L hip extension weakness against direct resistance, but has sufficient strength against resistance with R hip flexion, this is considered positive\n\n\n\nto Organize\n“Hoover’s sign was also tested in every subject. In the supine position, the patient is told to lift one extended leg, and the examiner exerts an opposing downward pressure on the lifted leg. At the same time, the examiner places his other hand under the heel of the unlifted leg, and evaluates the synergic downward pressure by exerting an opposing upward force.”2\n“Hoover’s original description indicated that the sign is composed of two separate tests.8 The first, here named Hoover’s test 1, examines the complementary opposition of the paretic leg when the sound leg is lifted. This downward pressure is compared against the strength of the hip extensor manually tested beforehand. The paresis was judged to be non-organic if the paretic leg exerted full downward opposition, stronger than the manually tested strength. The paresis was judged to be organic if the downward pressure was equally weak to the manually tested strength. When the manually tested strength of the hip extensor was full, this test was not diagnostic.”2\n“Hoover’s test 2 examines the complementary opposition of the sound leg when the patient lifts or attempts to lift the paretic leg. When the sound leg exerts only weak downward pressure and is passively lifted by the examiner’s hand, the paresis is judged to be non-organic. A normally strong downward opposition of the sound leg suggests organic paresis. When the manually tested strength of the hip flexor is full, this test is not diagnostic.”2\n“We judged that Hoover’s sign as a whole indicated nonorganic paresis if at least one of the two tests suggested nonorganic paresis, because both phenomena indicating nonorganic paresis were unlikely to occur in organic paresis.”2\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "“This test does not rely on the objectivity of the end-feel. Instead, an indirect shearing maneuver is used, and the reproduction of pain is considered a positive test. The patient lies in the side-lying position facing the clinician, with the lumbar spine positioned in neutral and the hips and knees flexed to approximately 45 degrees. The clinician, using the fleshy part of one forearm, applies a downward pressure on the lateral aspect of the patient’s trunk at the level of the L3 transverse process (Fig. 28-49). This produces a lateral translation of the entire lumbar spine in the direction of the bed. The pressure is applied and monitored for pain. The test is repeated with the patient side lying on the opposite side.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Dutton M. Dutton’s Orthopaedic Examination, Evaluation, and Intervention. 5th ed.

The leg furthest from the edge of the bed (nontested leg) is flexed 90 degrees at the hip and held by the clinician using one hand. The clinician passively positions the upper leg (test leg) into hyperextension at the hip so that it hangs over the edge of the table (Fig. 29-25). The clinician applies a further stretch to the test leg into hip extension and adduction up to six times while a flexion-based counter force is applied to the flexed leg. Pain with this maneuver is considered a positive test for an SIJ lesion, pubic symphysis instability, hip pathology, or an L4 nerve root lesion. The test also stresses the femoral nerve.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Dutton M. Dutton’s Orthopaedic Examination, Evaluation, and Intervention. 5th ed.

One should introduce the application of incrementally greater movements and loads or investigate VA flow using Doppler sonography or an magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) scan before performing a grade V technique in the cervical spine1. The clinician should consider avoiding placing the patient’s cervical spine in the extremes of rotation and side bending in both the examination and the subsequent intervention, which would obviate the need for these tests1."

The clinician stabilizes the distal humerus with one hand and palpates the distal forearm with the other. The anterior band of the MCL tightens in the range of 20–120 degrees of flexion, becoming lax in full extension, before tightening again in hyperextension. The posterior bundle is taut in flexion beyond 55 degrees. The anterior band is tested by flexing the elbow to between 20 and 30 degrees to unlock the olecranon from its fossa, as a valgus stress is applied continuously (Fig. 17-37). The posterior band is best tested using a “milking” maneuver. The patient is seated, and the arm is positioned in shoulder flexion, elbow flexion beyond 55 degrees, and forearm supination. The clinician pulls downward on the patient’s thumb (Fig. 17-38). This maneuver generates a valgus stress on the flexed elbow. A positive sign is indicated by the reproduction of pain.

    "section": "Consistent hand placement and force generation",
    "text": "Consistent hand placement and force generation\n\nLever Arm\nLever arm: The patient’s ability to resist examiner force has a great deal to do with the length of the lever arm through which the force is applied. The patient will be able to resist force to a greater extent (sometimes much greater) when a short lever arm is used versus a long lever arm (see the Try This! exercise on the following page). Thus, it is imperative that the length of the lever arm is consistent each time the test is performed through the course of rehabilitation. Most commonly, to allow for more sensitive and discriminative grading during MMT, you should use a long lever arm.33,71\n\n\nDirection of Force\n“Direction of force: The placement of the hand that provides the testing force, as well as the direction(s) of the force provided, are highly important. Once the limb or body segment is in the optimal testing position, pressure is applied in a direction (or directions) that is directly opposite the line of pull of the muscle. The more precise your direction of force, the better each muscle’s primary action can be elicited. Imprecise direction of examiner-applied force can substantially diminish the accuracy of the test. For example, testing of the tibialis posterior requires the ankle joint to begin in a position of plantar flexion and inversion, with the examiner’s force applied in the directions of dorsiflexion and eversion.72 If the examiner fails to apply adequate force in the direction of dorsiflexion (primarily applying force in the direction of eversion) then the patient’s tibialis anterior would likely attempt to kick in because it is also a strong ankle invertor.”\n\n\nSpeed of Force production\n“The resistive force you provide should ramp up over the course of 1–2 seconds, be held 3–5 seconds, and then be ramped down over the course of 1–2 seconds”\n\n\nMagnitude of Force\n“As mentioned in the Gross Muscle Strength section, you must provide adequate force to overcome the force produced by the patient for any given muscle. The magnitude of force will naturally be different for smaller muscles versus larger ones.57 It should be intuitive that one will not provide the same amount of force when testing the biceps as one would use to test the extensor digitorum of the hand.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "“The Trendelenburg sign indicates a weakness of the gluteus medius muscle during unilateral weight bearing. This position produces a strong contraction of the gluteus medius, which is powerfully assisted by the gluteus minimus and TFL, in order to keep the pelvis horizontal. For example, when the body weight is supported by the left foot (Fig. 19-19), the left hip abductors contract both isometrically and eccentrically to prevent the right side of the pelvis from being pulled downward by gravity. The clinician crouches or kneels behind the patient so that the eyes are level with the patient’s pelvis, and ensures that the patient does not lean to one side during the testing. The patient is asked to stand on one limb by flexing the opposite hip to approximately 30 degrees. The patient may use a light touch with the ipsilateral upper extremity for balance, or the clinician may provide gentle manual pressure to maintain balance and reduce any trunk shift. Once balanced, the patient is asked to raise the nonstance pelvis as high as possible. From the posterior view, the clinician observes the angle formed by a line that connects the iliac crest and a line vertical to the testing surface. If the patient can maintain the elevation of the hip of the nonstance side for 30 seconds, the test is considered negative. A positive Trendelenburg sign is indicated if one of the following criteria is met22:”1\n\nThe patient is unable to hold the elevated pelvic position for 30 seconds.\nNo elevation is noted on the nonstance side.\nThe stance hip adducts, allowing the pelvis on the nonstandard side to\n\n“drop downwardly below the level of the stance side pelvis (Fig. 19-19). A goniometer may be used to quantify the amount of pelvic movement by placing the axis of the goniometer on the ASIS, the stationary arm along an imaginary line between the two ASIS landmarks, and the moving arm along the anterior midline of the femur.126”1\n“A false-negative may occur if the patient is allowed to shift his or her trunk too far laterally over the stance limb (reverse Trendelenburg sign) in an attempt to prevent the contralateral pelvis from dropping and to reduce the demand on the hip abductors. A number of dysfunctions can produce the Trendelenburg sign. These include superior gluteal nerve palsy, lumbar disk herniation, weakness or tear of the gluteus medius, and advanced degeneration of the hip. Thus, if used in isolation, this test has little diagnostic value”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Dutton M. Dutton’s Orthopaedic Examination, Evaluation, and Intervention. 5th ed.

    "text": "Syndesmosis & Mortise\n\nCotton (Clunk) Test.\n\n“The patient lies in the supine position with their foot over the end of the bed. One hand is used to stabilize the distal leg on the bed while the clinician uses the other hand to grasp the heel and move the calcaneus laterally (see Fig. 21-44).93 A clunk can be felt as the talus hits the tibia and fibula if there has been significant mortise widening.”2\n\nThe Crossed-Leg Test\n\n“The crossed-leg test mimics the squeeze test (see later) and attempts to induce separation of the distal syndesmosis.95,98 The patient sits in a chair, with the injured leg resting across the knee of the uninjured leg. The resting point should be at approximately mid-calf. The clinician then applies a gentle force on the medial aspect of the knee of the test leg (Fig. 21-49). Pain experienced in the area of the distal syndesmosis suggests the presence of injury. This test may not be useful for patients with knee or hip pathology because it may be difficult for them to assume the test position. Reliability and validity data for this test are not yet available.”2\n\nSqueeze Test\n\n“In the squeeze test, the patient lies in supine or side-lying position and the clinician squeezes the lower third of the leg at a point just above the ankle (Fig. 21-52). Pain felt in the distal third of the leg may indicate a compromised syndesmosis (high ankle sprain), if the presence of a tibia and/ or fibula fracture, calf contusion, or compartment syndrome (see Chapter 5) has been ruled out.”2\n\nThe One-Legged Hop Test\n\n“The one-legged hop test is performed by having the patient stand on the injured leg and hop continuously.95 Nussbaum et al.97 reported that patients with syndesmosis injuries could not complete 10 repetitions of unilateral hopping without significant pain. However, the one-legged hop test should be used with caution, and perhaps only if the other special tests are negative because performing this test may impose further separation of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis.95”2\n\nKleiger Test (External Rotation Test)\n\n“The Kleiger (external rotation) test is a general test to implicate the syndesmosis if pain is produced over the anterior or posterior tibiofibular ligaments and the interosseous membrane, but can also be used to assess the integrity of the medial (deltoid) ligament of the ankle complex. If this test is positive, further testing is necessary to determine the source of the symptoms. The patient sits with their legs dangling over the end of the bed; the knee flexed to approximately 90 degrees, and the foot relaxed. The clinician stabilizes the lower leg with one hand and, using the other hand, grasps the foot and externally rotates it (Fig. 21-45). Pain experienced at the anterolateral aspect of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis is a positive sign for syndesmosis injury, whereas pain on the medial aspect of the ankle and/or displacement of the talus from the medial malleolus (depending on severity) with the ankle positioned in plantar flexion may indicate a tear of the medial (deltoid) ligament of the ankle.”2\n\nThe Point Test\n\n“The point test also referred to as the palpation test, is used to impose pressure on the anterior distal tibiofibular syndesmosis.94,95 The patient can be positioned in supine or sitting. The clinician applies pressure directly to the anterior aspect of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis (Fig. 21-46). Pressure is applied gradually, and a positive test involves a report of pain by the patient.”2\n\nThe Dorsiflexion Compression Maneuver\n\n“The dorsiflexion compression maneuver is performed to force the wider anterior portion of the talar dome into the ankle mortise, thereby inducing separation of the distal fibula and tibia. The patient sits at the edge of the examination table, and the clinician stabilizes the patient’s leg with one hand, while the clinician’s other hand passively moves the foot into dorsiflexion (Fig. 21-47). Pain experienced at the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis is a positive test result. A variation of the dorsiflexion maneuver exists, known as the dorsiflexion compression test, which involves patients moving their ankle joints into extreme dorsiflexion in bilateral weight-bearing. Patients are asked to note the pain they experience in this position and the position of the tibia is noted with an inclinometer. The patient then assumes an upright position and the clinician applies medial–lateral compression with two hands on the malleoli of the injured leg. The clinician maintains the medial–lateral compression, as the patient is asked to move the ankles into dorsiflexion again and to report if the endrange pain has changed compared with the previous movement. A positive test result is either a reported reduction in the end-range pain or an increase in dorsiflexion ROM.”2\n\nFibula Translation Test\n\n“The patient is placed in the side-lying position with the tested leg uppermost. The clinician applies an anterior and posterior force on the fibula at the level of the syndesmosis (Fig. 21-48). A positive test is a pain during translation and more displacement of the fibula than the compared side. Although a cadaver study by Beumer et al.96 found this test to have a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 88% (LR+ 6.8; LR− 0.2), the study only found increased translation when all ligaments were removed in the cadavers.”\n\nHeel-Thump Test\n\n“The heel-thump test is performed to force the talus into the mortise, in an attempt to impose a separation of the distal syndesmosis.95,99 The patient lies at the edge of the examination table, with the ankle resting in plantar flexion. The clinician holds the patient’s leg with one hand and with the other hand applies a gentle but firm thump on the heel with their fist (Fig. 21-50). This force is applied at the center of the heel and in line with the long axis of the tibia. Pain experienced at the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis suggests the presence of injury. Although the heel thump test has been recommended to help differentiate between a syndesmotic sprain and a lateral ankle sprain, this test may not be specific for a syndesmotic sprain as the test has also been recommended to assess the possible presence of tibial stress fractures.100 Reliability and validity data for this test are not yet available.”2\n\nPosterior Drawer Test\n\n“The posterior drawer test can also be used to test for the presence of instability at the distal tibiofibular joint. The patient is supine. The hip and knee are flexed to provide as much dorsiflexion of the ankle as possible. This drives the wide anterior part of the talus back into the mortise. An anterior stabilizing force is then applied to the cruris, and the foot and talus are translated posteriorly (Fig. 21-51). If the distal tibiofibular joint is stable, there will be no drawer available, but if there is instability, there will be a drawer.”2"

    "section": "Lateral Collaterals",
    "text": "Lateral Collaterals\n“The lateral collateral ligaments of the ankle resist inversion. An additional function is to prevent excessive varus movement, especially during plantar flexion. In extreme plantar flexion, the mortise no longer stabilizes the broader anterior part of the talus, and varus movement of the ankle is then possible.”2\n\nCalcaneus Tilt\n\n“The patient lies in the supine position. The lower leg is stabilized using a lumbrical grip while the other hand grasps the foot and calcaneus. The clinician applies a medially directed force in an attempt to adduct the calcaneus, thereby gapping the lateral side of the ankle (Fig. 21-53). Pain on the lateral aspect of the ankle with this test, and/or displacement (depending on severity) may indicate a sprain of the ligament.”2\n\nTalar Tilt\n\n“This test is used to determine whether the CFL is torn. The patient lies in a supine or side-lying position with the foot relaxed and the knee flexed. The clinician places the foot in the anatomical (90 degrees) position to bring the CFL perpendicular to the long axis of the talar. The talus is then tilted from side to side into adduction and abduction (Fig. 21-54). Adduction tests the CFL and, to some degree, the ATFL, whereas abduction stresses the deltoid ligament. No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this test.”2\n\nAnterior Drawer Test\n\n“The anterior drawer stress test is performed to estimate the stability of the ATFL. The test is performed with the patient seated at the end of the bed or lying supine with their knee flexed, to relax the gastrocnemiussoleus muscles, and the foot supported perpendicular to the leg. The clinician uses one hand to stabilize the distal aspect of the leg, while the other hand grasps the patient’s heel and positions the ankle in 10–20 degrees of plantar flexion (Fig. 21-55). Either the heel is very gently pulled forward, or the clinician can manually apply a posterior force on the tibia. The clinician attempts to visually and manually assess the quantity of talar movement and to determine if an asymmetry exists between the involved and the uninvolved ankle. If the test is positive, the talus, and with it the foot, rotates anteriorly out of the ankle mortise around the intact medial (deltoid) ligament of the ankle, which serves as the center of rotation. Variances in hand position, joint congruency, forces imparted, the perception of movement, scoring methods, and tissue variability are factors that may affect the reliability of this test.101”2\n“It has been reported that 4 mm of laxity in the ATFL, resulting from posttraumatic attenuation or fibrosis, will give a clinically apparent anterior drawer (2 mm is normal)false-positive findings may be seen in up to 19% of uninjured ankles in those with ligamentous laxity.102,103 As is often the case, when combining the results from several tests, diagnostic accuracy can be enhanced. For example, a 2013 study by Croy et al.102 reported that when the combination of pain on lateral ligament palpation, hematoma formation of the lateral ankle, and a positive anterior drawer test were used a lateral ligament lesion was correctly diagnosed in 95% of cases.”2\n\nThe Dimple Sign\n\n“Another positive sign for a rupture of the ATFL, if pain and spasm are minimal, is the presence of a dimple located just in front of the tip of the lateral malleolus during the anterior drawer test. This results from a negative pressure created by the forward movement of the talus, which draws the skin inwards at the site of the ligament rupture. This dimple is also seen with a combined rupture of the ATFL and CFLs. However, the dimple is only present within the first 48 hours after injury, due to organized hematoma and repair tissue blocking the communication between the joint and the subcutaneous tissues.”2"

As the nerve fiber terminates, it forms the motor endplate1. The motor endplate is made up of multiple branching nerve terminals that invaginate upon the surface of the muscle fiber, but does not penetrate the muscle fiber plasma membrane1. The muscle fiber membrane invaginated by the motor endplate is known as the synaptic gutter or trough1.\n“The invaginated membrane is called the synaptic gutter or synaptic trough, and the space between the terminal and the fiber membrane is called the synaptic space or synaptic cleft, which is 20 to 30 nanometers wide. At the bottom of the gutter are numerous smaller folds of the muscle membrane called subneural clefts, which greatly increase the surface area at which the synaptic transmitter can act.”1\n“In the axon terminal are many mitochondria that supply adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy source used for synthesis of a transmitter, acetylcholine, which excites the muscle fiber membrane. Acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytoplasm of the terminal but is absorbed rapidly into many small synaptic vesicles, about 300,000 of which are normally in the terminals of a single end plate. In the synaptic space are large quantities of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which destroys acetylcholine a few milliseconds after it has been released from the synaptic vesicles.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In NSAIDs, there is a reduction in satellite cell differentiation,3 a process that is essential for muscle regeneration. There is also inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity, which is thought to be necessary for muscle growth, and, lastly, attenuation of mitochondrial function,8 which reduces endurance capacity of muscle. In human studies, the influence of NSAIDs is less clear. In healthy older adults, NSAIDs protected against inflammation-induced muscle weakness and age-related muscle loss,13 despite no improvement in muscle size.14 Opioids are known to decrease corticospinal excitability15,16 and increase exercise-induced central fatigue through intracortical inhibition,17 which could have a substantial effect on motor drive and muscle activation during exercise. Remarkably, however, the specific impact of opioids, muscle relaxants, and central nervous system inhibitors on muscle physiology is largely unknown.18,19”2\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "title": "Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Neuman\n“G reater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) involves degenerative changes of the distal tendinous attachments of the gluteus medius and minimus and, in some cases, associated bursitis.67 GTPS can be a primary cause of lateral hip pain, most commonly affecting women more than 40 years of age.6,81 Classic signs include aching or point tenderness near or on the greater trochanter (where the gluteal muscles attach), weakened hip abduction, and a gait deviation consistent with weak or painful hip abductor muscles (described later in this chapter). Symptoms are often exacerbated by activities that demand high, sustained, or repetitive forces from the hip abductors, such as standing on one limb, climbing stairs or hills, or prolonged walking. As with all pain in the hip region, associated co-morbidities must be ruled out as well as pain referred from the low back region.81”1\n“The primarily pathology underlying GTPS is believed to be tendinopathy of the gluteus medius and minimus. MRI often shows a thickening or a thinning of the affected tendons as well as partialor full-thickness tears.6,41,81,179 Tears occur more frequently in the tendon of the gluteus medius as it attaches to the lateral and superior-posterior facets of the greater trochanter.6 In up to 20% of cases, bursitis may be associated with GTPS, either in the bursa beneath the distal attachments of the gluteus medius and minimus or, more frequently, in the bursa over the posterior-inferior aspect of the greater trochanter and just under the gluteus maximus”\n“The pathology associated with tendinopathy of the gluteus medius or gluteus minimus has features similar to rotator cuff pathology.50 For this reason, GTPS has been loosely referred to as the “rotator cuff syndrome of the hip.” The supraspinatus and gluteal tendons both tend to show degenerative changes on the undersurface of the tendon as it abuts against bone.68 Pain is usually insidious and chronic in both GTPS and rotator cuff syndrome, typically involving attritional degeneration or tears rather than acute rupture from an isolated event. The degenerative changes that tend to occur in these muscles are, in some way, related to a failure of the tissues to absorb and tolerate mechanical stress. Forces from the gluteal muscles, required at every mid stance phase of gait, impose relatively large and repetitive stresses on their respective tendons.5 Such stress is ordinarily described as tension, because it pulls the tendon away from the bone, but insofar as the very distal aspect of that tendon is pulled directly into the bone, the stress is also a localized compression.81 The magnitude of the compressional stress may be influenced by simultaneous forces acting on the overlying fascia lata of the thigh exerted in part by the tensor fasciae latae muscle. Stiffening of this complex could create an inward push against the underlying gluteal tendons as they wrap superior-medially over the greater trochanter, amplifying the localized compression on the gluteal tendons.81 Over time, the repeated compressional stress might degrade and weaken the tissue matrix of the tendon insertion. Subsequent small tears or abrasions in the tendon theoretically place greater stress on the intact, healthy parts of the tendon, thereby predisposing these tissues to degeneration as well. The precise pathology of GTPS and the associated gluteal tendinopathy are not well understood.”1\n“Although theoretical, one factor leading to GTPS may be related to a prior history of weakness or otherwise reduced abduction torque potential of the gluteus medius and minimus. A scenario of weakness of the gluteal muscles could increase the compensatory demands on the more superficial abductor hip mechanism (i.e., the tensor fasciae latae muscle and associated lateral fascia of the thigh). Such compensation, if occurring at every gait cycle, could plausibly abrade the gluteal tendons to the point that they undergo attritional degeneration or even failure. Much more biomechanical and histologic research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of GTPS in order to better treat this condition.”1\n\n\nConservative Treatment\n“Conservative treatment has been described for GTPS, including use of anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid injection, a cane in the hand contralateral to the affected hip, and physical therapy.41,81 Grimaldi and Fearon have proposed a physical therapy approach that limits activities or exercises involving hip adduction (both pelvic-on-femoral and vice versa). This precaution is believed to minimize compressional stress on the insertions of the gluteal tendons as the tensor fasciae latae and associated lateral fascia are stretched across the lateral side of the hip. In addition, initial physical therapy sessions may incorporate non–pain-provoking isometric abduction exercises in positions that limit hip adduction. As thoroughly outlined by Grimaldi and Fearon,81 methods of applying greater resistance with non–isometric-type exercises may be judiciously incorporated when tolerated.”1\n\n\nSurgical Treatment\n“When conservative treatment is unsuccessful, surgical repair of the tendons may be indicated. Both open and endoscopic surgical approaches have been shown to produce favorable results”1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Neumann DA, Kelly ER, Kiefer CL, Martens K, Grosz CM.

    "text": "Holding Strength\n“The holding strength of muscles is about 40% greater than the contractile strength. That is, if a muscle is already contracted and a force then attempts to stretch out the muscle, as occurs when landing after a jump, this action requires about 40% more force than can be achieved by a shortening contraction. Therefore, the force of 525 kilograms previously calculated for the patellar tendon during muscle contraction becomes 735 kilograms (1617 pounds) during holding contractions, which further compounds the problems of the tendons, joints, and ligaments. It can also lead to internal tearing in the muscle. In fact, forceful stretching of a maximally contracted muscle is one of the surest ways to create the highest degree of muscle soreness.”1"

    "section": "",
    "text": "“The innate immune system responds almost immediately to microbes and injured cells, and repeated exposures induce virtually identical innate immune responses. The receptors of innate immunity are specific for structures that are common to groups of related microbes and do not distinguish fine differences among microbes. The principal components of innate immunity are (1) physical and chemical barriers, such as epithelia and antimicrobial chemicals produced at epithelial surfaces; (2) phagocytic cells (neutrophils, macrophages), dendritic cells (DCs), mast cells, natural killer (NK cells), and other innate lymphoid cells; and (3) blood proteins, including components of the complement system and other mediators of inflammation. Many innate immune cells, such as DCs, some macrophages, and mast cells, are tissue resident, and they function as sentinels to keep watch for microbes that may invade the tissues. The innate immune response combats microbes by two main strategies—by recruiting phagocytes and other leukocytes that destroy the microbes, in the process called inflammation; and by blocking viral replication or killing virusinfected cells by mechanisms distinct from inflammatory reactions. We will discuss the features, mechanisms, and components of innate immunity in Chapter 4.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Abbas AK, Lichtman AH, Pillai S, Baker DL.

    "section": "Step 1 – Interpret the interaction term first.",
    "text": "Step 1 – Interpret the interaction term first.\nIf the interaction term is statistically significant, you know that simply interpreting the main effects will not lead to an accurate understanding of the results. You also know that any interpretations you make of the main effects will need to be qualified to include information about the interaction effects. This is important because the statistically significant interaction effect may be indicating that the overall pattern of differences across the groups at the level of the main effects are not likely to be consistent across all the rows or columns in your design.\nStep 2 – Interpret the main effects.\nIf there are statistically significant main effects and interactions, then you should comment upon the main effects, but do so in a qualified way, while emphasizing that the interactions may be the more important findings. For example, if there is an overall difference from pretest to posttest, but there is also a group by time interaction, it is possible that the treatment group grew over time and the control group did not. In this case, it would not be meaningful to emphasize an overall difference over time when it may be due only to the treatment group. However, in another case both groups may grow over time and there is an overall average growth rate that is meaningful. This pattern may or may not be accompanied by an advantage for the treatment group.\nIf you only have statistically significant main effects and not interactions, then it will be necessary to follow up on any statistically significant main effects where there are three of more groups with post hoc comparisons. These comparisons will be made at the level of the overall group means for the main effect in question, collapsed across levels of any other variable in the model. If the main effect is for a between subjects term, SPSS will perform these post hoc comparisons for you. If they are for a within subjects effect, you will need to use the spreadsheet on the web.\nStep 3 – Graph the data “both ways”.\n“Both ways” means exchange the row and column variables to determine which picture is most useful. Typically it is most helpful to illustrate “change over time”, or whatever the within-subjects variable is, on the X axis. Typically it is also most helpful to put the group variable, or whatever the between-subjects term is, as the separate lines variable. This means that the time variable is on the X axis and the Groups are represented by different lines.\nRemember to use the Profile Analysis Approach to interpreting these graphs. This means that the Main Effect for Group is represented by the height of the lines. If the lines are at the same height, no difference, and if they are at different heights then there may be enough of a difference for a statistically significant main effect.\nThe Main Effect for Time is represented by the slope of the lines. Flat lines mean no differences over time and no statistically significant effects. Sloped lines mean there may be a statistically significant main effect for time, or change over time. Think about the overall main effect for time as a test of whether the line that would represent the overall means for each time point is a flat or sloped line.\nThe Group X Time Interaction is represented on the graph by the parallelism of the lines. If the lines are parallel, there is not a statistically significant interaction effect. If the lines are not parallel, then there may be a statistically significant interaction effect. This means that the groups were changing at different rates and the overall average line may not represent the real patterns in the data.\nStep 4 – If the interaction term is statistically significant, qualify the interpretation of the main effects.\nStep 5 – If there is a statistically significant main effect with only two levels, no more analyses are needed for that effect. Simply examine the two marginal means (row or column totals).\nStep 6 – If there is a main effect with more than two levels, perform post hoc comparisons among the marginal means (row or column totals).\nStep 7 – Next, turn to the interaction effects.\nThere is not one rule that fits all situations. The exact comparisons needed to make interpretations will vary from analysis to analysis. Look for the portion of your graphs where the lines are non-parallel. The means that comprise these sections of the graph will be a good place to start in Step 8.\nStep 8 – Consider Simple Effects first.\nThis means look at the pattern of differences with rows or columns in your design first. If they are different, then you have your answer about where the interaction is coming from. This means that you can use the Tukey spreadsheet to tell you the pattern of group differences within rows or columns in your design. Say for example that cells 1, 2, and 3 make up the first row in your design and cells 4, 5, and 6 make up the second row. If the results of the Tukey tests show that 1 &gt; 2, 3 in the first row, while 4, 5 &gt; 6 in the second row, then you have explained the interaction.\nIf this approach does not completely explain the interaction, then you will need to consider looking at cell mean comparisons across rows and columns. Again, there are no simple rules to guide you here. There is no substitute for studying the graphs and determining what comparisons are the most important.\nStep 9 – Effect size calculations.\nAgain, there is no one rule that will fit every situation. Your job is to illustrate the findings from your study with the effect sizes that fit the pattern in the results. The best strategy is to use effect sizes to illustrate the most important findings from the study. Effect sizes can be an effective way to contrast the amount of difference in one part of your design with the amount of difference in a contrasting part of the design. Often the most useful effect sizes are those that contrast differential rates of growth across the groups.\nFor Within-subjects terms, use the Dependent Case tab in the spreadsheet. Remember to enter the correlation between the two time points in question if you intend to use the confidence intervals. For Between-subjects terms, use the Independent Case tab in the spreadsheet."

Since we are using the exact same test and cutoff value, we would expect the number of people correctly identified as positive (true positive rate) to stay the same2.

It explicitly tries to correct for both model complexity and sample size by including each in its computation. Lower RMSEA values indicate better fit. The question of what is a “good” RMSEA value is debatable. Although previous research had sometimes pointed to a cut-off value of .05 or .08, more recent research points to the fact that drawing an absolute cut-off for RMSEA is inadvisable [17]. An empirical examination of several measures found that the RMSEA was best suited to use in a confirmatory or competing models strategy as samples become larger [47]. Large samples can be considered as consisting of more than 500 respondents. One key advantage to RMSEA is that a confidence interval can be constructed giving the range of RMSEA values for a given level of confidence. Thus, it enables us to report that the RMSEA is between 0.03 and 0.08, for example, with 95 percent confidence. ”1\n\nInterpretation\nThe smaller the RMSEA, the better the fit2.\n\n\n\nRMSEA\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n&lt;0.05\nVery Good2\n\n\n&lt;0.10\nGood2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n0.05 is generally used a cutoff value for RMSEA which is often the same as the cut-off for p-values, but this is merely a coincidence2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "“In case-control or cross-sectional studies, where we cannot calculate incidence rates, the odds ratio (OR) is typically calculated. The OR is the ratio of the exposure odds (O) among the case group to the exposure odds among the control group (Figure 2): Ocase ¼ A/C, Ocontrol ¼ B/D,OR¼ Ocase/Ocontrol), and it is interpreted similarly to the RR. An OR equal to 1 indicates no association, an OR less than 1 suggests that the exposure is protective (exposure is less likely among the case group), and OR greater than1 suggests that the exposure is a risk factor (exposure is less likely among the control group). For example, in a case-control study examining the association between infection with human papillomavirus b and risk of squamous cell carcinoma, an OR of 4.0 (95% CI ¼ 1.3e12.0) was observed (Asgari et al., 2008). This OR indicates that the odds of being exposed (i.e., having this human papillomavirus subtype) were 4 times greater among the case group than the control group or, put another way, that cases were 4 times more likely to have this human papillomavirus subtype than controls.”1 “When the outcome is rare, the OR approximates the RR. This assumption, known as the rare disease assumption, can be visualized in Figure 2. When the proportions in cells A and C are small, A þ B z B and C þ D z D. Therefore, RR ¼ [A/ (A þ B)]/[C/(C þ D)] z (A/B)/(C/D) ¼ (A/C)/(B/D) ¼ OR. When the outcome is more common (&gt;10%), however, the OR provides more extreme estimates than the RR. In Figure 2, where 44% of the study population has the outcome, the OR is much smaller than the RR.”1\n\n\n\n“The hazard ratio (HR) is the ratio of the rate at which the exposed group experiences an outcome to the rate at which the unexposed group experiences an outcome, and it provides the instantaneous risk at a given time rather than the cumulative risk over the length of a study. It is calculated in survival or time-to-event analyses, in which the outcome variable is the time (days, months, years, etc.) until the occurrence of the event of interest, such as development of a disease, disease complication (e.g., cancer recurrence), death, or other outcome. Participants who do not experience an event during the follow-up period are censored. This occurs if the participant is lost to follow-up, the follow-up period ends and the participant is event-free, or the participant experiences another outcome. At the time of censoring, the participant stops contributing follow-up time to the analysis. This type of censoring is known as right-censoring, because the true unobserved event lies to the right of the censoring time. For example, in a survival analysis of acral lentiginous melanoma, both melanoma-specific survival and overall survival, or all-cause mortality, were examined. In the melanoma-specific survival analysis, only melanoma-related deaths were considered events, and participants who died of causes not related to melanoma were right-censored at the time of death. In the overall survival analysis, however, deaths from any cause were considered events (Asgari et al., 2017). In contrast to right-censoring, left-censoring occurs when the event has already taken place before the observation period begins, and the true unobserved event lies to the left of the censoring time. Estimation of the HR, as with Cox proportional hazards regression, accounts for only rightcensored data (Clark et al., 2003).”1\n“When the HR is equal to 1, instantaneous event rates at a particular time are the same in the exposed and unexposed groups. When the HR is equal to 0.5, half as many people in the exposed group have experienced an event compared with the unexposed group, and when HR is equal to 2, twice as many people have experienced an event. For example, in a study examining the association between systemic immune suppression and Merkel cell carcinoma-specific survival, an HR of 3.8 was observed (95% CI ¼ 2.2e6.4) (Paulson et al., 2013). This estimate indicates that the rate of death from Merkel cell carcinoma was 3.8 times higher in people with systemic immune suppression. Because the 95% CI excludes the null value of 1, we can conclude that this HR is statistically significant.”2\n\n\n\n“Correlation coefficients, including the Pearson r and Spearman rho statistics, measure the strength and direction between two variables and range from e1(perfectnegative correlation) to þ1 (perfect positive correlation). A positive correlation coefficient indicates that both variables increase or decrease together, whereas a negative coefficient implies that as one variable increases, the other decreases (see examples in Table 2). The Pearson r statistic is generally used when data are continuous rather than categorical, and it assumes that the data are normally distributed and that the variables are linearly related. When these assumptions are not met, or when categorical data are involved, Spearman rho may be more appropriate. Spearman rho assumes a monotonic relationship between ranked variables and can be used for ordinal-level data. It is essentially a Pearson correlation using variable ranks rather than variable values. Spearman rho is the nonparametric version of Pearson r,and therefore it may be appropriate for nonnormally distributed data or when variables are not linearly related (McDonald, 2014a). For example, in a study examining cutaneous sarcoidosis, Rosenbach et al. (2013) calculated the correlations between disease severity and quality of life using several different instruments. The Physician’s Global Assessment of disease severity was found to be moderately positively correlated with Skindex-29 assessments of symptoms (Pearson r ¼ 0.41) but weakly negatively correlated with the Sarcoidosis Health Questionnaire assessment of quality of life (Pearson r ¼ e0.18). The Physician’s Global Assessment, Skindex-29, and Sarcoidosis Health Questionnaire data were normally distributed. Because the data from another assessment, the Dermatology Life Quality Index, were not normally distributed and the sample size was small, the authors used the Spearman rho correlation coefficient to identify a weak positive correlation with the Physician’s Global Assessment (r ¼ 0.24).”1\n\n\n\n“Linear regression is used to assess the relationship between a continuous outcome variable and one or more categorical or continuous predictor variables. For continuous predictors, a positive b coefficient represents the increase in the outcome variable for every 1-unit increase in the predictor variable. Conversely, a negative b coefficient represents the decrease in the outcome variable for every 1-unit increase in the predictor variable. Beta coefficients for categorical predictors have a similar interpretation, except that the coefficient represents the change in the outcome variable when switching from one category of the predictor variable to another. For instance, a study of patients with systemic sclerosis sought to investigate associations between demographic and medical variables and sleep disturbance, measured using a sleep quality scale. The number of gastrointestinal symptoms (continuous predictor) and sleep disturbance (continuous outcome) were positively associated (b ¼ 0.19, P ¼ 0.001). The beta coefficient indicates that for each 1-unit increase in the number of gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep quality score increases by 0.19 units. Female sex was also positively associated with sleep disturbance, although the association was not statistically significant (b ¼ 0.07, P ¼ 0.164). Because sex is a categorical variable, this beta coefficient indicates that being female, as opposed to being male, is associated with a 0.07-unit increase in sleep quality score (Milette et al., 2013).”1\n\n\n\n“The chi-squared and Fisher exact statistics are often used for testing relationships between categorical variables. These tests evaluate whether the proportions of one categorical variable differ by levels of another categorical variable (see example in Table 2). The null hypothesis for the chi-squared/ Fisher exact test is that the variables are independent; that is, the level of variable A does not predict the level of variable B. For each level of one variable, the expected frequencies at each level of the second variable are calculated. The chisquared test statistic is based on the difference between the frequencies that are actually observed and those that would be expected if there were no relationship between the two variables. The more computationally intensive Fisher exact test is typically used only when sample sizes are small. These tests do not evaluate the magnitude of the association but indicate whether the association is statistically significant. For example, in a study examining patient satisfaction after treatment for nonmelanoma skin cancer with either destruction, excision, or Mohs surgery, categorical patient characteristics were compared among treatment groups using chi-squared or Fisher exact tests. The training level of the treating clinician (attending, resident, or nurse practitioner) differed significantly by treatment group (P &lt; 0.001) (Asgari et al., 2009a).”1\n\n\n\n“The risk difference is the absolute difference in risk between exposed and unexposed groups, and it is useful for evaluating the excess risk of disease associated with an exposure. The relative risk reduction is the proportion of risk that is reduced in the exposed group relative to the unexposed group. The number needed to treat is the number of patients who must be treated for one patient to benefit. Calculations for risk difference, relative risk reduction, and number needed to treat are shown in Figure 2, and examples are provided in Table 2.”"

An RR less than 1 suggests that the exposure is protective (Iexposed &lt; Iunexposed), and an RR greater than 1 suggests that the exposure is a risk factor for the outcome (Iexposed &gt; Iunexposed). For example, the relationship between dietary vitamin D intake and risk of melanoma was investigated in a cohort study, and a RR of 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.94e1.82) was observed for the highest quartile of vitamin D compared with the lowest quartile (Asgari et al., 2009b). The point estimate indicates a 31% increased risk of melanoma (or 1.31 times the risk) among participants with the highest level of vitamin D intake, but because the CI includes the null value of 1, we would not consider the finding statistically significant.”2"

This family of lipids plays an important role in human nutrition.\n\nOmega nomenclature\nSince the physiological function of the lipid is dictated by the position of the 1st double bond relative to the methyl end of the chain, PUFA’s have an alternative nomenclature based on the methyl end1.\n\nThe carbon of the methyl group is the most distant from the carboxyl group, and thus it is called ω (omega; the last letter in the Greek alphabet) carbon1.\nThis ω carbon is given the number 1 (C-1)1.\nthe carboxyl carbon is on the opposite end and thus has the highest number1.\nThis naming scheme allows one to signify the position of the double bond (number) from the methyl group (ω)1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nPUFA with a double bond between the C-3 and C-4 carbons are called omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids1\nPUFA with a double bond between C-6 and C-7 are called omega-6 (ω-6) fatty acids1\n\n\n\n\n\nDiet\nAn imbalance of omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs in the diet is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease1\nAccording to Lehninger, the optimal dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in the diet ranges from 1:1 and 4:11.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "“The female sex hormone estrogen probably also accounts for some of the difference between female and male performance, although not nearly so much as testosterone. Estrogen increases the deposition of fat in the female, especially in the breasts, hips, and subcutaneous tissue. At least partly for this reason, the average young (age 16–19 years) nonathletic female has about 34% body fat composition, in contrast to the nonathletic young male (age 16–19 years), who has about 23% (Figure 85-1). The average percentages for body fat are higher in older men and women and have increased substantially over the past 20 to 30 years as the prevalence of obesity has risen in populations of most developed countries. In the United States, for example, the prevalence of obesity in now approximately 37% of the adult population. Increased body fat composition is a detriment to the highest levels of athletic performance in events in which performance depends on speed or on the ratio of total body muscle strength to body weight.”1"

Reported cases include poor positioning while under anesthesia, neoplastic structures impinging the musculocutaneous nerve, and strenuous upper extremity exercise without apparent underlying disease1. Some theorize that exercise-related cases are caused by entrapment of the nerve within the coracobrachialis and/or traction between a proximal fixation point at the coracobrachialis and a distal fixation point at the deep fascia at the elbow1.\nInjury to this nerve can also result from demanding physical work involving shoulder flexion and repetitive elbow flexion with a pronated forearm.35 Although rare, an isolated lesion to the musculocutaneous nerve can result in weakness of the biceps, coracobrachialis, and brachialis (Table 3-3). These muscles help stabilize the elbow and the G-H joint and maintain the static position of the arm."

    "text": "The navicular (“navy”) is named after its resemblance to a ship1. The navicular articulates proximally with the talus and distally with the cuneiforms1.\n“The navicular is named for its resemblance to a ship (i.e., referring to “navy”). Its proximal (concave) surface accepts the head of the talus at the talonavicular joint (see Fig. 14.4). The distal surface of the navicular bone contains three relatively flat facets that articulate with the three cuneiform bones.”1\n\nNavicular Tuberosity\n“The medial surface of the navicular has a prominent tuberosity, palpable in the adult at about 2.5 cm inferior and distal (anterior) to the tip of the medial malleolus (see Fig. 14.6). This tuberosity serves as one of several distal attachments of the tibialis posterior muscle.”1\n\n\nPalpation\n“he navicular is the most prominent bone on the medial aspect of the foot. The navicular tuberosity can be located by moving proximally from the medial aspect of the first cuneiform (see Fig. 21-1). The talonavicular joint line lies directly proximal to the navicular tuberosity. In addition, the posterior tibialis, which can be made more prominent with resisted plantar flexion, adduction, and supination, can be used as a reference as it inserts on the plantar surface of the navicular (see later). Tenderness of the navicular could indicate the presence of a fracture or osteochondritis of the navicular (Köhler disease).”2\n\n\nNavicular Drop\nTest for navicular drop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The posterior aspect of the calcaneus and surrounding soft tissue is palpated for evidence of exostosis (“pump bump” or Haglund’s deformity) and associated swelling (retrocalcaneal bursitis). The inferior medial process of the calcaneus, just distal to the weight-bearing portion of the calcaneus, serves as the attachment of the plantar fascia and is often tender with plantar heel pain.”2\n\n\nDysfunction\n\nThe apophysis In the pediatric patient, the apophysis is considered the weakest point in the muscle-tendon-bone attachment, as opposed to the tendon in adults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n\nCalcaneal Osteomyelitis\n\n\n\nMSK\n\nSever’s Disease (Calcaneal Apophysitis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustentaculum Tali\n“Distal and inferior to the medial malleolus, a shelf-like bony prominence of the calcaneus, the sustentaculum tali, can be palpated.

    "text": "Functional Role\n“The patella functions as a “spacer” between the femur and quadriceps muscle, which increases the internal moment arm of the knee extensor mechanism (Fig. 13.27). By definition, the knee extensor internal moment arm is the perpendicular distance between the mediallateral axis of rotation and the line of force of the muscle. Because torque is the product of force and its moment arm, the presence of the patella augments the extension torque at the knee.”1\n“Researchers have shown that the knee extensor internal moment arm changes considerably across the full arc of knee flexion and extension.166,297,301 Although the data published on this topic differ considerably based on methodology and natural variability, most studies report that the knee extensor moment arm is greatest between about 20 and 60 degrees of knee flexion (see bar on horizontal axis in graph of Fig. 13.26).41,166,297 This range of relatively high leverage partially explains why knee extension torques are typically highest across a significant part of this same range of motion. Maximal-effort knee extension torque typically falls off dramatically in the last 30 degrees of extension, likely because of a combination of reduced extension leverage and shortened muscle length.”1\n“At least three fact”\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "title": "Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Cruciate Ligament\n“The two central intra-articular cruciate ligaments derive their name from the Latin word crucere (cross) because they cross each other (Fig. 20-1). Both the ACL and the PCL lie in the center of the joint, and each is named according to their attachment sites on the tibia.1 The cruciate ligaments, which differ from those of other joints in that they restrict normal, rather than abnormal, motion, are the main stabilizing ligaments of the knee and restrain against anterior (ACL) and posterior (PCL) translations of the tibia on the femur. They also restrain against excessive internal and external rotation and varus/valgus movements of the tibia.”1\n“The blood supply to the cruciate ligaments is largely provided from the middle and inferior geniculate branches of the popliteal artery. The cruciate ligaments are innervated by the posterior articular nerve, a branch of the posterior tibial nerve.1 The function of this nerve supply is questionable although it may serve as proprioceptive in nature. In addition, the cruciate ligaments contain mechanoreceptors, suggesting that disruption of the ligament structure can produce partial deafferentation of the joint.10 Evidence of a proprioceptive function of the ACL comes from extensive histologic observations demonstrating that the ACL appears to contain proprioceptive nerve endings.1 Although these cruciate ligaments function together, they are described separately.”1\n\n\nInfo\n“Posterior cruciate (see Fig. 20-1). It provides the primary restraint to posterior translation and medial rotation of the tibia on the femur and is a secondary restraint to valgus and varus rotation of the tibia.”1\n\n\nAnatomy\n“The PCL attaches posteriorly to the insertion of the posterior horns of the lateral and medial menisci on the posterior part of the posterior intercondylar fossa of the tibia.1 From here, the PCL extends obliquely medially, anteriorly, and superiorly to attach to the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle (see Fig. 20-1). Overall, the ligament is wider at its femoral origin and narrowest near the tibial insertion.1 The PCL is covered by synovial lining and is therefore considered to be extrasynovial yet intra-articular.”1\n\n\nBiomechanics\n“Information regarding the biomechanical function of the PCL is scant compared with that of the ACL. It is known that the PCL is 50% thicker and has twice the tensile strength of the ACL.1 The PCL is more vertical in extension and horizontal in flexion. Like the ACL, the PCL consists of two bundles: anterior lateral and posterior medial. Overall, the ligament is most taut with further flexion of the knee.14 Specifically, the anterior lateral bundle is taut in flexion, while the posterior medial bundle is taut in extension.”1\n\n\nFunction\n“The PCL provides the vast majority of the total restraint to posterior translation of the tibia on the femur, with the remainder being provided by the collateral ligaments, posterior portion of the medial and lateral capsules, and the popliteus tendon. The contribution percentage resisting posterior translation decreases as the knee extends. The PCL also restrains internal rotation of the tibia on the femur and helps prevent posteromedial instability at the knee.14”1\n“Other functions of the PCL include acting as a secondary restraint to external rotation of the tibia on the femur at 90 degrees of flexion, assisting with a rolling/gliding mechanism of the tibiofemoral joint, and resisting varus/valgus forces at the knee after the collateral ligaments have failed.14”1\n“In concert with the PCL are the anterior and posterior meniscofemoral ligaments. Although these ligaments arise from the common PCL origin, they are distinct structures having different insertion sites.18 Both are named with respect to the orientation to the PCL (see “Lateral Meniscus” section). Since the insertion site of the meniscofemoral ligaments is different from that of the PCL, if a midsubstance tear of the PCL occurs, it is possible that one or both of the meniscofemoral ligaments may remain intact.”1\n\n\nDysfunction\n“A significant force is needed to tear the PCL. Thus, tears of the PCL are usually the result of severe contact injuries that often occur in traumatic situations, such as a dashboard injury during a motor vehicle accident.”1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Cruciate Ligament\n“The two central intra-articular cruciate ligaments derive their name from the Latin word crucere (cross) because they cross each other (Fig. 20-1). Both the ACL and the PCL lie in the center of the joint, and each is named according to their attachment sites on the tibia.1 The cruciate ligaments, which differ from those of other joints in that they restrict normal, rather than abnormal, motion, are the main stabilizing ligaments of the knee and restrain against anterior (ACL) and posterior (PCL) translations of the tibia on the femur. They also restrain against excessive internal and external rotation and varus/valgus movements of the tibia.”1\n“The blood supply to the cruciate ligaments is largely provided from the middle and inferior geniculate branches of the popliteal artery. The cruciate ligaments are innervated by the posterior articular nerve, a branch of the posterior tibial nerve.1 The function of this nerve supply is questionable although it may serve as proprioceptive in nature. In addition, the cruciate ligaments contain mechanoreceptors, suggesting that disruption of the ligament structure can produce partial deafferentation of the joint.10 Evidence of a proprioceptive function of the ACL comes from extensive histologic observations demonstrating that the ACL appears to contain proprioceptive nerve endings.1 Although these cruciate ligaments function together, they are described separately.”1\n\n\nInfo\n“Anterior cruciate (Fig. 20-1). It provides the primary restraint to anterior translation and medial rotation of the tibia on the femur and is a secondary restraint to valgus and varus rotation of the tibia.”1\n“The ACL is a unique structure and one of the most important ligaments to knee stability. In addition to serving as a primary restraint to anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur, the ACL provides significant mechanical stabilization to the knee joint by preventing excessive hyperextension, as well as tibial rotation and anterior tibial translation while in flexion.11–13”1\n“The ACL (see Fig. 20-1) is composed of a vast array of individual fascicles. These, in turn, are composed of numerous interlacing networks of collagen fibrils. The fascicles originate on the inner aspect of the lateral femoral condyle in the intercondylar notch (resident’s ridge), which serves as the anterior limit of the ACL in the anatomical position, and travel obliquely and distally through the knee joint. They enter the anterior intercondylar surface of the tibial plateau, where they partially blend with the lateral meniscus. As the fascicles of the ACL course through the knee joint and attach to their insertion sites, they fan out and give a slight spiral appearance to the ligament, a phenomenon that is more pronounced during knee flexion.”1\n\n\nSynovium\n“The synovial tissue that enfolds the ACL consists of an intimal layer, facing the joint cavity, and a subsynovial layer. The subsynovial layer is in direct contact with the ACL and contains neurovascular structures. The ACL is considered intra-articular yet extrasynovial because of the posterior invagination of the synovial membrane.”\n\n\nInnervation\n“Although the posterior articular nerve is the major nerve for the ACL, afferent fibers have also been demonstrated in the medial and lateral articular nerves.1”1\n\n\nHistology\n“Like all ligaments, the ACL behaves as a viscoelastic structure, allowing it to dissipate energy and to adjust its length and internal load distribution as a function of load history.14 This means that the normal ACL is capable of microscopic adjustments to internal stresses over time, thus influencing the laxity, stresses, and kinematics of the joint in subtle but potentially important ways. One anatomic factor that contributes to selective fiber recruitment during tensile loading is the specific location of the insertions of the ACL on the femur and the tibia. These differing insertion sites allow different fibers of the ACL to be recruited with every subtle three-dimensional (3D) change in the position of the joint.14”1\n\n\nFunctional Divisions (Bundles)\n“The ACL consists of two functional bundles—the anteromedial (A-M) and posterolateral (P-L) bundles—named for their position on the tibia. The femoral footprints of the A-M and P-L bundles are vertically aligned when the knee is in full extension, and the femoral origin of the A-M bundle is located superior to the P-L insertion.15 In this configuration, the two bundles are parallel to each other, whereas with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion, the two bundles cross each other, and the femoral insertions are nearly horizontally aligned.15,16 The tensile strength of the ACL is equal to that of the knee collaterals, but it is half that of the PCL.14 Since its fibers are unyielding, forcing the ACL more than 5% beyond its resting length may result in rupture.14 Several factors can influence the amount of tension on the ACL16,17:”1\n\n“When the knee is in full extension, the A-M and P-L bundles are under tension.”1\n“When the knee is at 60–90° of flexion, the P-L bundle is lax and allows rotation of the tibia on the femur.”1\n“The P-L bundle limits anterior translation of the tibia at low angles of knee flexion (0–30°).”1\n“The A-M bundle primarily resists anterior translation of the tibia and undergoes less change in length than the P-L bundle throughout the range of knee motion.”1\n“The P-L bundle is maximally lengthened when the knee is in full extension, and the A-M bundle is under maximum tension when the knee is flexed between 45 and 60°”1\n“Compressive loading of the tibiofemoral joint, such as that occurs during WB, has been shown to reduce anteroposterior laxity and stiffen the joint when compared with the non–weight-bearing (NWB) position. These changes appear to reflect the increased strain borne by the ACL during the transition from NWB to WB. Thus, the popular belief in the beneficial effects of early WB and closed-kinetic chain exercises (CKCEs) following anterior cruciate reconstruction may be open to question.”1\n\nSee Table 20-1 of Dutton1\n\n\n\n\nPeak Strain\nSee Table 20-1 of dutton1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The superficial band is separated from the deep layer of the ligament by a bursa.

    "text": "Single leg bridge\nOne can recruit the multifidus muscle by having a patient perform a single leg bridge. In this exercise, one will have a leg on the ground (stance leg) and another leg in the air. Both shoulders will remain on the ground the whole time. As an example, we will imagine an individual using their R leg as the stance leg. Since both shoulders are stationary, the weight of the pelvis and raised leg (L) will add a load d/t gravity that pulls the L hip towards the ground, resulting in relative right rotation. Thus, in order to keep the pelvis level, one must perform active left rotation using the R multifidus since the multifidi perform C/L rotation unilaterally. An easy way to remember which multifid you are recruiting during S/L bridge is that the multifidi on the same side as the stance leg is being recruited."

Moving superiorly from the midline onto the skull, you come to the external occipital protuberance. Its most prominent protrusion is called the inion, or the “bump of knowledge.” Move laterally from the external occipital protuberance to palpate the superior nuchal lines, short transverse ridges that may or may not be palpable.\nNuchal ligament —If the patient elongates his spine by pulling the crown of the head up and dropping the chin in toward the throat, you will be able to palpate the cordlike nuchal ligament connecting the spinous processes of each of the cervical vertebrae. When the patient is relaxed the nuchal ligament will not be readily palpable. Spinous processes of C1–T12—Carefully differentiate each of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, understanding that C1 spinous process cannot be palpated.\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYomogida N, Kerstein C.

The much larger deep head attaches on the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone (see Figs. 11.5 and 11.6). The smaller superficial head attaches to a region of the posterior side of the maxilla, just above the third molar (compare perspectives of Figs. 11.6 and 11.7).99 Both heads course nearly parallel with the masseter muscle and attach on the internal surface of the ramus, near the angle of the mandible (compare perspectives of Figs. 11.2 and 11.4). The actions of the two heads of the medial pterygoid are essentially identical. Acting bilaterally, the medial pterygoid elevates and, to a limited extent, protrudes the mandible. Because of the oblique line of force of the muscle, a unilateral contraction of the medial pterygoid produces a very effective contralateral excursion of the mandible”2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction between Medial pterygoid and masseter\n\n\n\n“T he medial pterygoid and masseter muscles form a functional sling around the angle of the mandible (Fig. 11.20). Simultaneous contractions of these muscles can exert a powerful biting force that is directed through the jaw and ultimately between the upper and lower molars.57 The maximal biting force in this region averages about 422 N (95 lb) in the adult, twice that generated between the incisors.61 Acting on the internal and external sides of the mandible, the masseter and medial pterygoid also produce an important sideto-side force between the upper and lower molars. As shown in Fig. 11.18, simultaneous contraction of the right medial pterygoid and left masseter produces left lateral deviation. Contraction of these muscles in this synergistic fashion can produce a very effective shear force between the molars and food, on both sides of the mouth. The combined muscular action is very effective at grinding and crushing food before swallowing.articular disc. The inferior head attaches within the pterygoid fossa and adjacent neck of the mandible. A third head of the muscle has also been proposed, based on the multiple pattern of distal attachments.”\n“The precise action and role of the two heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle during mastication is controversial and not completely understood.74,106 The lack of understanding partially reflects the muscle’s deep location and subsequent technical challenge to electromyographic study. It is generally agreed, however, that unilateral contraction of both heads of the lateral pterygoid produces contralateral excursion of the mandible (see Fig. 11.18). Furthermore, unilateral muscle contraction rotates the ipsilateral condyle anterior-medially within the horizontal plane—a typical kinematic component of contralateral excursion (reviewed in Fig 11.14B). Usually a given right or left lateral pterygoid muscle contracts synergistically with other muscles during mastication. For example, as depicted in Fig. 11.18, a biting motion that involves left lateral excursion is controlled by the right lateral and medial pterygoid muscles and, to a lesser extent, by the left masseter and temporalis.”\n“Bilateral contraction of both heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle produces a strong protrusion of the mandible.61 As fully described ahead in the discussion of muscular control of opening and closing of the mouth, the two heads of the lateral pterygoid are active at different phases of opening and closing of the mouth. (For this and other morphologic considerations, some authors have argued that the two heads of the lateral pterygoid are actually separate muscles.28) Most sources suggest that the inferior head is the primary depressor of the mandible, especially during resisted opening of the mouth.65,74,77,82 The superior head, in contrast, helps control the tension within the disc and its position during resisted closure of the jaw.65,74 This action is especially important during resisted, unilateral closure of the jaw, such as when biting down on a hard piece of candy.”\n\n\n\n\nPalpation\nIntraoral: Posterior and medial to mandibular molars (have subject deviate away)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Significance\n\n1.

When the hip is internally rotated past 40°, the OE generates an external rotation torque2.\n\n\nOverview\n“The obturator externus muscle arises from the external side of the obturator membrane and adjacent ilium (see Fig. 12.14). The belly of this muscle is visible from the anterior side of the pelvis after removal of the adductor longus and pectineus muscles (see Fig. 12.26, left side). The muscle attaches posteriorly on the femur at the trochanteric fossa (see Fig. 12.6). (Based on its leverage to produce adduction, location, and innervation, the obturator externus is more anatomically associated with the adductor group of muscles than with the other five short external rotators. The obturator externus is innervated by nerve roots that originate from the lumbar plexus [via the obturator nerve], as are most of the other adductor muscles. The other small external rotators, in contrast, are innervated through the sacral plexus, with nerve roots as low as S2.)”3\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The action of these muscles as secondary internal rotators is discussed later in this chapter. Understanding that the adductor muscles produce torques in all three planes of motion helps justify their large size and possibly their vulnerability to strain­ related injury.”1"

    "text": "Frontal Plane Function\n“Frontal Plane Function The most obvious function of the adductor muscles is production of adduction torque. This torque controls the kinematics of both femoral­on­pelvic and pelvic­on­femoral hip adduction. Fig. 12.33 shows an example of selected adductor muscles contracting bilaterally to control both forms of motion. On the right side, several adductors are shown accelerating the femur to strike the soccer ball. Adding to the forcefulness of this action is the down­ ward rotation or lowering of the right iliac crest—a motion occur­ ring by pelvic­on­femoral adduction of the left hip. Although only the adductor magnus is shown on the left side, other adductor muscles assist in this action. The overall adduction of the planted left hip typically incorporates eccentric activation of the gluteus medius to help decelerate and thus help control the kinematics of pelvic­on­femoral motion. Weakness of the hip abductors during a soccer kick may place excessive valgus strain on the planted knee, which has been theorized to increase the risk of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in female soccer players.”1"

    "text": "Sagittal Plane Function\n“Regardless of hip position, the posterior fibers of the adductor magnus are powerful extensors of the hip, similar to the hamstring muscles.222 Of interest, however, is that within an arc of about 40 to 70 degrees of hip flexion, the line of force of most of the other adductor muscles runs directly through or close to the medial­lateral axis of rotation of the hip. At this point, the adductor muscles, as a group, lose much of their potential to produce torque in the sagittal plane.103 When outside the 40­ to 70­degree flexed posi­ tion, however, the individual adductor muscles regain leverage as significant flexors or extensors of the hip.57,103 Consider, for example, the adductor longus as a representative adductor muscle during a fast sprint (Fig. 12.34A). From a position of about 100 degrees of hip flexion, the line of force of the adductor longus is well posterior to the medial­lateral axis of the joint. At this position the adductor longus has an extensor moment arm and is capable of generating an extension torque—similar to the posterior head of the adductor magnus. From a hip position of near extension, however, the line of force of the adductor longus is well anterior to the medial­lateral axis of rotation (see Fig. 12.34B). The adduc­ tor longus now has a flexor moment arm and generates a flexion torque qualitatively similar to that of the rectus femoris, for example. The adductor muscles therefore provide a useful source of flexion and extension torque at the hip. The bidirectional torques are useful during high­power, cyclic motions such as sprinting, cycling, running up a steep hill, and descending and rising from a deep squat. When the hip is near full flexion, the adductors are most mechanically prepared to augment the exten­ sors. In contrast, when the hip is near full extension, they are most mechanically prepared to augment the flexors. This utilitarian function of the adductors may partially explain their relatively high susceptibility to soreness or strain injury during running and jumping, especially while quickly changing directions.”1"

Additional distal attachments of this muscle include the MCL, both menisci, and the oblique popliteal ligament. For most of its course, the sinewy semitendinosus tendon lies posterior to the semimembranosus muscle. Just proximal to the knee, however, the tendon of the semitendinosus courses anteriorly toward its distal attachment on the anteriormedial aspect of tibia. Both heads of the biceps femoris attach primarily to the head of the fibula, with lesser insertions to the lateral collateral ligament, the capsule of the proximal tibiofibular joint, and the lateral tubercle of the tibia.265”2\n“The semimembranosus muscle (Fig. 19-8) arises from the lateral facet of the ischial tuberosity and the ischial ramus. This muscle inserts into the posteromedial aspect of the medial tibial condyle and has a key expansion that reinforces the posteromedial corner of the knee capsule. The semimembranosus pulls the meniscus posteriorly, and internally rotates the tibia on the femur, during knee flexion, although its primary function is to extend the hip and flex the knee.”3\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Over the flattened lateral surface of the thigh, the fascia latae thickens to form a strong band, the iliotibial tract. When the hip is flexed, the TFL is anterior to the greater trochanter and helps maintain the hip in flexion. As the hip extends, the TFL moves posteriorly over the greater trochanter to assist with hip extension. The TFL is also a weak extensor of the knee, but only when the knee is already extended. The muscle is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve, L4–L5.”3\n“The tensor fascia latae attach to the ilium just lateral to the sartorius (see Fig. 12.26). This relatively short muscle attaches distally to the proximal part of the iliotibial band. The band extends distally across the knee to attach to the lateral tubercle of the tibia. The iliotibial band is a component of a more extensive connec­tive tissue known as the fascia lata of the thigh.216 Laterally, the fascia lata is thickened by attachments from the tensor fasciae latae and the gluteus maximus. The remainder of the fascia lata encir­ cles the thigh, located within a plane deep to subcutaneous fat. At multiple locations, the fascia lata of the thigh turns inward between muscles, forming distinct fascial sheets known as intermuscular septa. These septa partition the main muscle groups of the thigh according to innervation. The intermuscular septa of the thigh ultimately attach to the linea aspera on the posterior surface of the femur, along with attachments of most of the adductor muscles and several of the vasti muscles (components of the quadriceps).”4\n“From the anatomic position, the tensor fascia lata is a primary flexor and abductor of the hip. The muscle is often considered a secondary internal rotator,57,162,177 although its leverage for this action is likely only functionally significant when activated from a position of external rotation. As suggested by its name, the tensor fasciae latae increase tension in the fascia lata. Although speculation, activation of the tensor fasciae latae (and theoretically the gluteus maximus and to a lesser extent the psoas minor170) can transmit a force around the thigh and between muscle groups. In some manner, this tensional force within the fascia lata may influ­ ence the function of the underlying thigh muscles. Tension in the fascia lata is most certainly transmitted inferiorly through the iliotibial band and may help stabilize the extended knee. Repeti­ tive tension within the iliotibial band may cause inflammation at its insertion site near the lateral tubercle of the tibia. Maneuvers designed to stretch a tightened tensor fascia lata (which may include the iliotibial band and adjacent tissues) are often per­ formed with the knee extended combined with various combina­ tions of hip adduction and extension.”4\n\n\nMuscle length test (MLT)\n\nThomas test\n\nThe TFL can be biased by manually externally rotating the hip during the Thomas test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome clinicians test TFL length during the Thomas test by seeing if the hip is abducted and moving it into 0° abduction, but this is not as specific as external rotation since it would not differentiate that from Sartorius tightness.\n\n\n\n\nStretches\n\n3D hip flexor stretch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Strength Test\n\n“Plantar flexion strength can be tested initially in non–weight-bearing (Fig. 21-22). However, unless there is significant weakness, clinician strength is usually insufficient to overcome ankle plantar flexor force, which necessitates a weight-bearing assessment of ankle plantar flexor strength. If no plantar flexion weakness is apparent in non–weight-bearing, a heel raise test is performed in the functional position, standing with the knee extended and the opposite foot off the floor Technically, one heel raise through full ROM, while standing with support on one leg, scores a 3/5 (fair) with manual muscle testing, with five single-limb heel raises scoring a 4/5 (good) and 10 single-limb heel raises scoring a 5/5 (normal). From a functional viewpoint, a wider range of scoring can sometimes prove more useful. Table 21-9 outlines an alternative scoring method. An alternative test, which is frequently used to assess talocrural and overall ankle function and is ften prescribed as an exercise, is the heel rise task. The task is performed using a block or a step, and the patient is positioned in standing with the balls of both feet on the block/step edge and the remaining parts of the feet over the edge. The patient may use a solid object for balance only. The patient is then asked to rise and lower his or herself on the balls of their feet as far as possible in each direction. The test can be also applied having the patient stand on only one leg. It is interesting to note that one study75 that measured both the ankle plantar flexion angle and the ankle dorsiflexion angle during this task found that the angles achieved were 23.7 degrees and 30.4 degrees respectively. The apparently large dorsiflexion angle compared to what is typically measured using a goniometer is likely the result that the motion combines both talocrural movement and forefoot movement.11 Although the task of raising up on the toes is generally thought to be predominantly performed by the triceps surae, a study by Kulig et al.76 reported significant contributions of the fibularis muscles and tibialis posterior during this task.”3"

    "text": "Strength Testing\n“The tibialis posterior muscle produces the motion of inversion in a plantar flexed position. The leg is stabilized in the anatomic position, with the ankle in slight plantar flexion. The plantar flexion is important to minimize the influence of the tibialis anterior muscle.77 Resistance is applied to the medial border of the forefoot into eversion and dorsiflexion (Fig. 21-24) VIDEO. The standing heel raise test can also be used to detect tibialis posterior weakness. It is thought that during a standing heel rise that the tibialis posterior and fibularis muscles co-contract to control hindfoot position. Thus, when the hindfoot everts during the heel-rise task, this is seen as a clinical sign of tibialis posterior weakness.”3"

    "text": "Overall Function\n\nPelvic-on-Femoral Hip Extension\n“The following sections describe two different situations in which the hip extensor muscles control pelvic­on­femoral extension. Hip Extensors Performing a Posterior Pelvic Tilt. With the supralumbar trunk held relatively stationary, the hip extensor and abdominal muscles act as a force­couple to posteriorly tilt the pelvis (Fig. 12.40). The posterior tilt extends the hip joints slightly and reduces the lumbar lordosis.”1\n“The muscular mechanics involved with posterior tilting of the pelvis are generally similar to those described for the anterior tilting of the pelvis (compare Figs. 12.28 and 12.40). In both tilting actions, the hip and trunk muscles form a force­couple for rotating the pelvis through a relatively short arc around the femoral heads. During standing, tensions exerted by the hip’s capsular ligaments and by hip flexor muscles normally determine the end range of the posterior pelvic movement, in stark contrast to how the lumbar spine restricts the end range of an anterior pelvic tilt.”1"

    "section": "Control Forward Lean",
    "text": "Control Forward Lean\n“Leaning forward while standing is a very common activity. Con­ sider, for example, the forward lean used when brushing your teeth over a sink. The muscular support at the hip for this near static posture is primarily the responsibility of the hamstring muscles. Consider two phases of a forward lean shown in Fig. 12.41. During a slight forward lean (see Fig. 12.41A), body weight is displaced just anterior to the medial­lateral axis of rotation at the hips. This slightly flexed posture is restrained by minimal activation from the gluteus maximus and hamstring muscles. A more significant forward lean, however, displaces body weight farther in front of the hips (see Fig. 12.41B). Supporting this markedly flexed posture requires greater muscle activation from the hamstring muscles. The gluteus maximus, however, remains relatively inactive in this position—a point verifiable by palpation and inferred from electromyographic data.70 The appar­ ent increased responsibility of the hamstrings (in contrast to the gluteus maximus) can be explained biomechanically and physi­ ologically. Forward leaning increases the hip extension moment arm of the hamstring muscles whereas it decreases the hip exten­ sor moment arm of the gluteus maximus.185 (Compare the 15­degree and 30­degree points in the graph in Fig. 12.41.) Leaning forward, therefore, mechanically optimizes the extension torque potential of the hamstrings.103 A significant forward lean also elongates the hamstring muscles across both the hip and the knee joints. The resulting increased passive tension in these elon­ gated biarticular muscles helps support the partially flexed posi­ tion of the hips. For these reasons the hamstrings appear uniquely equipped to support the hip during a forward lean. Apparently the nervous system holds the gluteus maximus partially in reserve for more powerful hip extension activities, such as rapidly climb­ ing a flight of stairs.”1"

    "section": "Femoral-on-Pelvic Hip Extension",
    "text": "Femoral-on-Pelvic Hip Extension\n“As a group, the hip extensor muscles are frequently required to produce large and powerful femoral­on­pelvic hip extension torque to rapidly accelerate the body forward and upward. Con­ sider, for example, the demands placed on the right hip extensors while one climbs a steep hill (Fig. 12.42). The flexed position of the right hip while the climber is carrying a heavy pack imposes a large external (flexion) torque at the hip. The flexed position, however, favors greater extension torque generation from the hip extensor muscles. Furthermore, with the hip mark­ edly flexed, many of the adductor muscles can produce an exten­ sion torque, thereby assisting the primary hip extensors. Activation of the low back extensor muscles helps support the flexed trunk, and also stabilizes the pelvis so that the strongly activated hip extensor muscles have a secure proximal attachment.” neumann “Fig 12.42 underscores the functional interdependence among many of the muscles of the lower extremity, particularly those involved with activities that combine hip­and­knee extension and ankle plantar flexion, such as climbing, sprinting, cycling, or jumping. Consider, for instance, the kinetic interaction between the rectus femoris and the gluteus maximus—two principle muscles necessary to perform the climbing activity depicted in Fig. 12.42. Large knee extension torque is required from the rectus femoris to offset the large knee flexion torques produced not only by body weight (and the supported external load) but also by large active knee flexion torques generated by the simultaneously activated hamstring and gastrocnemius muscles. Because of the biarticular arrangement of the rectus femoris, large forces produced by this muscle to extend the knee will, by necessity, also contribute to a large hip flexion torque: a torque that appears mechanically counterproductive to the movement of hip extension. Such muscles as the gluteus maximus and adductor magnus must thus match and exceed the hip flexion torque created by the active rectus femoris. Only then will the hip extensors accelerate the body upward and forward.”1"

Inferiorly, the capsule attaches to the edges of the articulating surfaces of the tibial plateaus, with the exception of the intercondylar eminence, and a small portion of the anterior intercondylar region.1 A synovial membrane lines the inner portion of the knee joint capsule. By lining the joint capsule, the synovial membrane excludes the cruciate ligaments from the interior portion of the knee joint, making them extrasynovial yet intra-articular.”1\n“The articularis genu, located superior to the patella, is thought to function to retract the knee capsule during knee extension.

Many studies have confirmed the role of the menisci in load transmission by showing decreased contact area and increased peak articular stresses following partial or total meniscectomy. WB produces axial forces across the knee, which compress the menisci, resulting in “hoop” (circumferential) stresses. By converting joint loading forces to radial-directed hoop stresses on their circumferential collagen fibers, and taking advantage of their viscoelastic nature, the menisci transmit approximately 50% of the joint load when the knee is in extension, and approximately 90% when the knee is in flexion.14 The lateral meniscus carries 70% of the compressive load in the lateral compartment, compared with just 40% of the medial meniscus in its respective compartment.25”1"

This is compensated for by the fact that the medial tibial plateau has a surface area roughly 50% larger than the lateral plateau, and articular cartilage that is approximately three times thicker than the lateral articular cartilage.1”1"

This increases the stability of the knee, especially during axial rotation and valgus–varus stresses.14 If the ACL is intact, the menisci do not significantly contribute to anteroposterior stability. However, in an ACLdeficient knee, the posterior horn of the medial meniscus functions as a secondary restraint to an anteroposterior translation by wedging between the femur and the tibia. In contrast, the increased mobility of the lateral meniscus prevents it from contributing to anteroposterior stability.26 This difference helps to explain the higher incidence of medial meniscus tears seen in ACL-deficient knees.26”1"

The lateral meniscus has greater mobility because it does not attach to the LCL, and, as mentioned previously, its capsular attachment is interrupted by the passage of the popliteus tendon. The posterior medial corner of the medial meniscus has the least amount of motion because it is constrained by its attachment to the tibial plateau by the meniscotibial portion of the posterior oblique ligament, which has been reported to be more prone to injury.23 During knee motion, the menisci move on the tibial plateau with the femoral condyles to maintain joint congruence. The femur, accompanied by the menisci, rolls anteriorly on the tibia during extension and posteriorly during flexion (Fig. 20-3).”1\n\n“During flexion of the knee, the menisci move posteriorly. The medial meniscus is moved about 5 mm by the pull of the semimembranosus tendon, and the lateral meniscus is pulled about 11 mm by the popliteus, resulting in an external rotation of the tibia.”1\n“During extension, the menisci move anteriorly.”1\n“During external rotation of the tibia, the menisci will follow the displacement of the femoral condyles, which means that the medial meniscus is pushed posteriorly, and the lateral meniscus is pulled anteriorly. During internal rotation, the opposite occurs. These rotations are conjunct, integral with flexion and extension, but can also be adjunct and independent, best demonstrated with the knee semiflexed. Conjunct external rotation of the tibia on the femur during the last stages of knee extension is part of a locking mechanism called the “screw home” mechanism, described later.”1\n“The medial coronary ligament is stretched during external rotation of the tibia, whereas the lateral coronary ligament is stretched during internal rotation of the tibia.”1"

It inserts distal and lateral to the patella at the tubercle of Gerdy on the lateral condyle of the tibia. Anteriorly, it attaches to the lateral border of the patellar. Posteriorly, it is attached to the tendon of the biceps femoris. Laterally, it blends with an aponeurotic expansion from the VL (see Chapter 19).”2\n“Like the patellar tendon, the ITB can be viewed as a ligament or a tendon. Its location adjacent to the center of rotation of the knee allows it to function as an anterolateral stabilizer of the knee in the frontal plane and to both flex and extend the knee.1 During stationary standing, the primary function of the ITB is to maintain knee and hip extension, providing the thigh muscles an opportunity to rest. While walking or running, the ITB helps maintain flexion of the hip and is a major support of the knee in squatting from full extension until 30 degrees of flexion. In knee flexion greater than 30 degrees, the iliotibial tract becomes a weak knee flexor, as well as an external rotator of the tibia.”2\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Jones B.

Therefore, clinical diagnosis relies predominantly on sensory symptoms and signs.”1\n“Thoracic nerves supply (by way of the intercostal nerves) the intercostal and abdominal muscles, which function predominantly in elevation and depression of the ribs, contraction of the abdomen, and flexion of the trunk. Thoracic nerve lesions result in intercostal muscle paralysis, which causes retraction of the costal interspace during inspiration and bulging of the interspace during cough or a Valsalva maneuver. Lower thoracic and upper lumbar root lesions may result in excessive protrusion of the abdomen during inspiration. When the abdominal muscles are affected there may be difficulty in rising from a recumbent position, and if these muscles are paralyzed unilaterally the umbilicus is pulled toward the normal side during inspiration or head elevation against resistance (while the patient is in the prone position). When there is bilateral lower abdominal muscle paresis below or at the T10 level, this maneuver results in elevation of the umbilicus (Beevor sign). Sensory disturbances are often predominantly or solely subjective. The patient complains of severe burning paresthesias or lightning-like pains. These occur in a unilateral or bilateral segmental distribution (radiating around the thorax or abdomen) and are precipitated by any maneuver that causes increased intraspinal pressure or stretching of the dorsal root (coughing, sneezing, Valsalva maneuver, neck flexion, spine movements). There may be sensory loss in the thoracic dermatome involved, but because of the overlapping cutaneous supply by adjacent nerve roots, complete section of a single dorsal root results in little or no sensory loss. An abdominal pseudohernia may be caused by herpes zoster truncal T12 radiculoneuropathy [19].”1\n“Axillary pain may be a heralding sign of neoplasm involving the upper thoracic root [32]. Pain in the armpit that is severe or progressive may be indicative of a malignant pathology, and evaluation should target the upper thoracic root regions.”1\n“A benign condition of unknown etiology, termed notalgia paresthetica, has been described in which burning, pruritus, and paresthesias develop over an area (approximately the size of the palm of the hand) at the medial margin of the scapula [27]. Decreased sensitivity to pain may occur in this area, which is likely in the territory of the dorsal branches of roots T2 to T6.”1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Brazis PW, Masdeu JC, Biller J.

With the patient lying down on his or her back on an examination table or exam floor, the examiner lifts the patient’s leg while the knee is straight. If the patient experiences sciatic pain when the straight leg is at an angle of between 30 and 70 degrees, then the test is positive and a herniated disc is likely to be the cause of the pain. A meta-analysis reported the accuracy of the straight leg test as 91% sensitive and 26% specific [7]. If raising the opposite leg causes pain (cross or contralateral straight leg raising), the sensitivity is 29% and the specificity is 88% [7]. The straight leg raising test and the cross straight leg raising test are two tests based on stretching of the nerves in the spine. The diagnostic accuracy of the straight leg raising test is thus limited by its low specificity [7].”4"

Paresis may occur in the scalene and levator scapulae muscles of the neck (including the infrahyoids, semispinalis capitis and cervicis, longissimus capitis and cervicis, intertransversarii, rotatores, multifidi), and in the trapezius (shoulder elevation), this last muscle being predominantly innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI). Diaphragmatic paresis may also result because the phrenic nerve receives some of its fibers from the C3 segment.”3\n“Irritation of the C3 nerve root may cause a painful, burning, red ear (red ear syndrome) [15]. The increased ear temperature may be caused by antidromic release of vasodilator peptides. This red ear syndrome may also occur with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and with thalamic lesions [15].”3\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "The PFJ is a complex articulation, dependent on both dynamic and static restraints for its function and stability. The patella (Fig. 20-1), a ubiquitous sesamoid bone found in birds and mammals, plays an important role in the biomechanics of the knee. Its articular anatomy is uncomplicated: it is a very hard, triangular-shaped bone, situated in the intercondylar notch and embedded in the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle above and the patellar tendon below. The groove has a complex architecture with increasing height of the groove’s lateral facet at the proximal aspect, providing a deeper “patella track” in knee extension.5 In healthy individuals, aspects of the femoral trochlea including its depth, as well as the shape and height of the lateral trochlea, can affect patellar tracking.6,7 From 20 to 30 degrees of knee flexion, the patella is confined within the trochlea and hence, the bony joint components provide inherent stability but, once beyond this range, there is little intrinsic bony support and stability must be provided by other soft-tissue structures, both passively and actively.6 The thickness of the patella varies considerably, attaining a maximum height of 2–2.5 cm (0.77–1 in) at its central portion.1 The posterior surface of the patella can include up to seven facets. The geometry of these facets varies between individuals and may affect patellar tracking.6 A smaller facet, known as the odd facet, exists medially and is delineated by a second vertical ridge. These concave medial and lateral facets are separated by a vertical ridge and are covered with aneural hyaline cartilage, the thickest cartilage in the body (up to 7 mm thick).1 The articular cartilage of the patella is unique because it lacks conformity with the underlying bone.8 The hyaline cartilage, here as elsewhere, functions to minimize the friction that occurs at the functional contact areas of the joint surfaces.\nRadiographic and cadaver studies have classified the patella into three Wiberg classifications (type A–C) based on the size and shape of these lateral and medial facets.\nThe patellar surface of the femur is divided into medial and lateral facets that closely correspond to those on the posterior surface of the patella. The PFJ functions to\nprovide the articulation with low friction; ▶ protect the distal aspect of the femur from trauma and the quadriceps from attritional wear; ▶ improve the cosmetic appearance of the knee; ▶ improve the moment arm (distance from the center of gravity and the center of rotation) of the quadriceps. This is achieved by elevating the quadriceps femoris muscle from the center of knee rotation. This increases the efficiency of the quadriceps muscle and provides it with leverage for extending the leg. The patellar contribution to the knee extensor moment arm increases with increasing amounts of knee extension; and ▶ decrease the amount of anteroposterior tibiofemoral shear stress placed on the joint."

Because increased knee flexion is associated with a greater relative increase in compression force than relative increase in articular contact area, the stress (force/area) is also greatest in the patellofemoral joint in the position of 60 to 90 degrees of knee flexion.53,261 Without the relatively large contact area to disperse the large compression force produced by the quadriceps, the stress within the joint would likely rise to intolerable physiologic levels.40,111 Having the area of joint contact greatest at positions that are generally associated with the largest muscular-based compression force naturally protects the joint against stress-induced cartilage degeneration. This mechanism allows most healthy and normally aligned patellofemoral joints to tolerate large compression forces over a lifetime, often with little or no appreciable discomfort or degeneration of the articular cartilage or subchondral bone. As will be explained, for many persons, however, the natural high-force environment within the patellofemoral joint is a major contributing factor to the development of patellofemoral pain syndrome.”1"

    "section": "Factors affecting Patella Tracking",
    "text": "Factors affecting Patella Tracking\n“The large compression forces that naturally occur at the patellofemoral joint are typically well tolerated, provided that the forces are evenly dispersed across the largest possible area of articular surface. A joint with less than optimal congruity, or one with subtle structural anomalies, will likely experience abnormal “tracking” of the patella. As a consequence, the patellofemoral joint is exposed to higher joint contact stress, thereby increasing its risk for developing degenerative lesions and pain. Such a scenario may lead to patellofemoral pain syndrome or potentially trigger osteoarthritis later in life. ”1\n\nQuadricep Role\n“Among the most important influences on patellofemoral joint biomechanics are the magnitude and direction of force produced by the overlying quadriceps muscle. As the knee is extending, the contracting quadriceps pulls the patella not only superiorly within the trochlear groove of the femur, but also slightly laterally and posteriorly. The slight but omnipresent lateral line of force exerted by the quadriceps results, in part, from the larger crosssectional area and force potential of the vastus lateralis. Because of the purported association between patellofemoral joint pain and excessive lateral tracking (and possible dislocation) of the patella, assessing the overall lateral line of pull of the quadriceps relative to the patella is a meaningful clinical measure. Such a measure is referred to as the quadriceps angle, or more commonly the Q-angle (Fig. 13.29A).91,244 The Q-angle is determined first by constructing a line representing an estimation of the resultant force vector of the different heads of the quadriceps. This line connects a point between the anterior-superior iliac spine and the midpoint of the patella.310 A second line is drawn representing the long axis of the patellar tendon, made by connecting a point on the tibial tuberosity with the midpoint of the patella. The Q-angle is formed at the intersection of these two lines, typically measuring about 13 to 15 degrees (±4.5 degrees) within a healthy adult population.244 The Q-angle assessment has been criticized for its poor association with pathology at the patellofemoral joint, inadequate standardized measurement protocol, and inability to measure dynamic alignment.124,177,260 Nevertheless, the Q-angle remains a popular and simple clinical index for a general assessment of the relative lateral pull of the quadriceps on the patella. Factors that naturally offset or limit the lateral pull of the patella are described in the next section. If these factors fail to operate in a coordinated fashion, the patella may track (shift and tilt) more laterally within the trochlear groove—kinematics that reduce contact area, increase patellofemoral joint stress and pain, and potentially increase the likelihood of chronic lateral dislocation of the patella.”1\n“Activation of the quadriceps as a whole also pulls and compresses the patella posteriorly against the femur, thereby stabilizing its path of movement relative to the distal femur. This stabilization effect increases with the knee in greater flexion (review Fig. 13.28). Even in full knee extension, however, some fibers of the quadriceps are aligned to produce a posterior compression through the patellofemoral joint.287 This is particularly apparent by observing a side-view diagram of the line of force of the oblique fibers of the vastus medialis (see Fig. 13.29B). Although relatively small, this posterior stabilizing effect on the patella is especially useful in the last 20 to 30 degrees of extension, at a point when (1) the patella is no longer fully engaged within the trochlear groove of the femur and (2) the resultant patellofemoral joint compression (stabilizing) force produced by the activated quadriceps as a whole is least.4”"

These factors are important to optimal tracking. In this context, optimal tracking is defined as movement between the patella and femur across the greatest possible area of articular surface with the least possible stress. Understanding the factors that favor optimal tracking provides insight into most pathomechanics and many treatments for pain and other dysfunctions of the patellofemoral joint. Both local and global factors will be described. Local factors are those that act directly on the patellofemoral joint. Global factors, on the other hand, are those related to the alignment of the bones and joints of the lower limb. Although these factors are described as separate entities, in reality, their effectiveness in optimizing patellar tracking is based on the sum of their combined influences.”1"

    "text": "The calcaneocuboid joint is a plane synovial joint1\n“The anterior surface of the calcaneus, which articulates with the reciprocally shaped posterior surface of the cuboid, is relatively convex in an oblique horizontal direction and relatively concave in an oblique vertical direction.8 The cuboid, most lateral in the distal tarsal row, is located between the calcaneus proximally and the fourth and fifth metatarsals distally. To the posterior (dorsal) surface are attached posterior (dorsal) calcaneocuboid, cubonavicular, cuneocuboid, and cubometatarsal ligaments, and to the proximal edge of the plantar ridge, deep fibers of the long plantar ligament. To the projecting proximal–medial part of the plantar surface are attached a slip of the tendon of tibialis posterior and flexor hallucis brevis (FHB). To the rough part of the medial cuboidal surface are attached the interosseous, cuneocuboid, and cubonavicular ligaments, and proximally the medial calcaneocuboid ligament, which is the lateral limb of the bifurcated ligament.8 The capsule is thickened posteriorly (dorsally) to form the posterior (dorsal) calcaneocuboid ligament. The joint has a large plantar phalanx to provide additional support during weight-bearing. A number of ligaments help provide support to this region. The spring ligament (plantar calcaneonavicular Fig. 21-3) connects the navicular bone to the sustentaculum tali on the calcaneus. The ligaments of the calcaneocuboid joint include the long plantar ligament and a portion of the bifurcate ligament posterior (dorsally).”1\n“The long and strong plantar ligament attaches to the plantar surface of the calcaneus, the tuberosity on the plantar surface of the cuboid bone, and to the bases of the second, third, and fourth (and possibly fifth) metatarsals.8 The plantar ligament functions to provide indirect plantar support to the joint, by limiting the amount of flattening of the lateral longitudinal arch of the foot. Together with the groove in the cuboid bone, it forms a tunnel for the passage of the fibularis (peroneus) longus tendon across the plantar surface of the foot.8 The perpendicular arrangement of the long and short plantar ligaments may compress the calcaneocuboid joint increasing its stability.11 During inversion, the cuboid inverts approximately twice as much as the calcaneus.19”1\n“The bifurcate ligament functions to support the medial and lateral aspects of the foot when weight-bearing in a plantar flexed position (twisted).”1\n“The plantar calcaneocuboid ligament, sometimes referred to as the short plantar ligament, is a relatively broad and strong strap-like structure that extends from the area of the anterior tubercle of the calcaneus to the adjacent plantar surface of the cuboid bone. It provides plantar support to the joint and possibly helps to limit flattening of the lateral longitudinal arch.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Dutton M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "“The tibiofemoral joint consists of the distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the tibia (Fig. 20-1). The tibiofemoral joint has great demands placed on it in terms of both stability and mobility. The femur is the largest bone in the body and represents approximately 25% of a person’s height.2 Its distal aspect (Fig. 20-1) is composed of two femoral condyles that are separated by an intercondylar notch or fossa. The intercondylar notch serves to accept the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).”1\n“The femoral condyles (see Fig. 20-1) project posteriorly from the femoral shaft. The smaller lateral femoral condyle is ball-shaped and faces outward, whereas the elliptical-shaped medial femoral condyle faces inward. The lateral condyle serves as the origin of the popliteus, whereas the lateral epicondyle serves as the origin of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). The medial epicondyle (see Fig. 20-1) serves as the insertion site for the adductor magnus, the medial head of the gastrocnemius, and the medial collateral ligament (MCL).”2\n“The anteroposterior length of the adult medial femoral condyle is on average 1.7 cm greater than that of its lateral counterpart, resulting in an increased length of the articular surface on the medial femoral condyle as compared with that of the lateral femoral condyle.1 Thus, the articulating surfaces are asymmetric, yet work in unison.4 The distal and the posterior portion of the femoral condyles articulate with the tibia.”1\n“The proximal tibia (see Fig. 20-2) is composed of two plateaus separated by the intercondylar eminence, including the medial and lateral tibial spines. The tibial plateaus are concave in a mediolateral direction. In the anteroposterior direction, the medial tibial plateau is also concave, whereas the lateral is convex, producing more asymmetry and an increase in lateral mobility. The medial plateau has a surface area that is approximately 50% greater than that of the lateral plateau, and its articular surface is three times thicker.1 The concavity of the tibial plateaus is accentuated by the presence of the menisci (see later).”1\n\nBiomechanics\n“The tibiofemoral joint, or knee joint, is a ginglymoid, or modified hinge joint, which has six degrees of freedom. For example, during gait it rotates about the sagittal, transverse, and coronal axes (i.e., osteokinematics), and translates in the sagittal, transverse, and coronal planes (i.e., arthrokinematics). The bony configuration of the knee joint complex is geometrically inappropriate and lends little inherent stability to the joint. Joint stability is, therefore, reliant on the static restraints of the joint capsule, ligaments, and menisci, and the dynamic restraints of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. Since the ligaments share tensile load-carrying functions with the musculotendinous units, these structures can be considered to complement each other’s functions directly. The PCL is located very near the long axis of tibial rotation and has been described as the main stabilizer of the knee.”1\n“The most common knee motions consist of flexion and extension in the sagittal plane, coupled with other motions such as varus and valgus motions, and external and internal rotation. This is because the longitudinal axis of the knee is not perpendicular to the sagittal plane but lies along a line that connects the origins of the collateral ligaments on the medial and lateral femoral epicondyles.”1\n“All the motions about the tibiofemoral joint consist of a rolling, gliding, and rotation of the femoral condyles and the tibial plateaus (Fig. 20-5). This rolling, gliding, and rotation occur almost simultaneously, albeit in different directions, and serve to maintain joint congruency.”1\n\n“Flexion and extension occur with a mediolateral translation around a mediolateral axis. In the relaxed standing position, with the knee straight or slightly flexed, the vector force is behind the knee; therefore, there is a tendency for further knee flexion unless the quadriceps contracts.”1\n“A varus–valgus angulation occurs with anteroposterior translation around an anteroposterior axis.”1\n“External and internal rotation of the joint occurs with superior–inferior translation around a superoinferior axis and transverse plane. The available range of motion (ROM) in rotation is dependent on the flexionextension position of the knee.37 The amount of rotation progressively increases from no rotation at the terminal extension to 70 degrees of rotation (40 degrees of external rotation and 30 degrees of internal rotation) available at 90 degrees of flexion. The amount of available rotation decreases as further flexion occurs.”1\n\n“During the initial 30 degrees of knee flexion, the LCL provides a greater contribution to resisting tibial varus, and the PMTC provides a greater contribution to resisting tibial external rotation and posterior translation.32,38 For flexion to be initiated from a position of full extension, the knee joint must first be “unlocked.” As mentioned previously, the service of locksmith is provided by the popliteus muscle, which acts to internally rotate the tibia with respect to the femur, enabling flexion to occur.”1\n“During flexion of the knee, the femur rolls posteriorly and glides anteriorly, with the opposite motion occurring during extension of the knee. This arrangement resembles a twin wheel, rolling on a central rail. Available knee flexion can vary between 120 and 160 degrees, depending on the position of the hip and the girth of the soft tissues around the leg and the thigh.”1\n“From 30 to 5 degrees of WB knee extension (moving toward full knee extension), the lateral condyle of the femur, together with the lateral meniscus, becomes congruent, moving the axis of movement more laterally. The tibial glide now becomes much greater on the medial side, which produces internal rotation of the femur, and the ligaments, both extrinsic and intrinsic, start to tighten near terminal extension. At this point, the cruciate ligaments become crossed and are tightened.”1\n“In the last 5 degrees of extension, rotation is the only movement accompanying extension. This rotation is referred to as the “screw home” mechanism and is a characteristic motion in the normal knee, in which during terminal knee extension the tibia externally rotates relative to the femur (Fig. 20-3). This motion is known to be a complex function of surface geometry of the menisci, tension in the ligamentous structures, and the action of muscles. This external rotation of the tibia through swing into stance allows for the tibia and foot to be in the correct alignment at initial contact.39 Interestingly, the screw home mechanism is reduced in ACL-deficient knees, which could be attributed to a reduction in passive tension developed during terminal stance, thereby influencing the sensation of knee instability in these individuals.”1\n“Knee hyperextension is usually available from 0 to 15 degrees.41 During knee hyperextension, the femur does not continue to roll anteriorly but instead tilts forward. This creates anterior compression between the femur and the tibia. In the normal knee, bony contact does not limit hyperextension as it does at the elbow. Rather, hyperextension is checked by the soft-tissue structures. When the knee hyperextends, the axis of the thigh runs obliquely inferiorly and posteriorly, which tends to place the ground reaction force anterior to the knee. In this position, the posterior structures are placed under tension, which helps to stabilize the knee joint, negating the need for quadriceps muscle activity.”1\n\n\nCapsular Pattern\n“The normal capsular pattern of the knee joint is a gross limitation of flexion and slight limitation of extension. The ratio of flexion to extension is roughly 1:10; thus, 5 degrees of limited extension corresponds to a 45–60-degree limitation of flexion. The causes of a capsular pattern in the knee are the same as for any other joint. These include traumatic arthritis, rheumatoid and reactive arthritis, osteoarthrosis, monarticular and steroid-sensitive arthritis, crystal synovitis or gout, hemarthrosis, and septic arthritis.”1\n\n\nClosed vs Open Chain\n“Open-kinetic chain (OKC) and closed-kinetic chain (CKC) exercises have different effects on tibial translation and ligamentous strain and load:”1\n\n“During active OKC knee extension, the shear component produced by unopposed contraction of the quadriceps depends on the angle of knee flexion, increasing as the knee flexion angle increases.”1\n“During CKC exercises for the lower extremity, the flexion moment arms of the knee and the hip increase as a squat is performed.”1\n\n\n\nDysfunction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACL Deficient Knees\n\n\n\n“The transition from NWB to WB has been found to produce a threefold increase of anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur in the ACL-deficient knee compared with the contralateral normal knees.”1\n\n\n\n\nROM\n\n\nJoint assessment\n\n\nMuscular assessment\n\n\nMobilization\n\n\nExercises\n\nKnee Controlled Articular Rotations (CAR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Automatic processing is reactive to triggers such as simple questions about one’s name1.\nThis was originally termed “system 1” or “the heuristic system,” but these terms are misleading by implying the reference to a single system2. As a result, “system 1” was replaced with “the autonomous set of systems (TASS)” to emphasize the fact multiple processing systems are working in conjunction2.\n\nDo not require “controlled attention” and as a result requires less mental resources2\n\nCorrelated features\n\nSome have argued that automatic processing is “mandatory” when triggered, but this is simply a correlation not a defining feature2.\nAutomatic processing is considered “fast” based on its rapid execution2.\n\n“These disparate categories make clear that the categories of Type 1 processing have some heterogeneityencompassing both innately specified processing modules or procedures and experiential associations that have been learned to the point of automaticity. The many kinds of Type 1 processing have in common the property of autonomy, but otherwise, their neurophysiology and etiology might be considerably different. For example, Type 1 processing is not limited to modular subprocesses that meet all of the classic Fodorian (Fodor, 1983) criteria or the criteria for a Darwinian module (Cosmides, 1989; Sperber, 1994). Type 1 processing also encompasses (general) processes of implicit learning and conditioning. Also, many rules, stimulus discriminations, and decisionmaking principles that have been practiced to the point of automaticity (Kahneman & Klein, 2009; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977) are processed in a Type 1 manner.”2"

Measures of working memory capacity have been shown to be predictive of performance in a wide variety of cognitive tasks (L. F. Barrett, Tugade, & Engle, 2004) and highly correlated with fluid intelligence (Colom, Rebollo, Palacios, Juan-Espinosa, & Kyllonen, 2004; Kane, Hambrick, & Conway, 2005). It is the engagement of this system specifically that Jonathan Evans (e.g., 2008, 2010a) has emphasized in the definition of Type 2 processing and which underlies many of its typically observed correlates: that it is slow, sequential, and correlated with measures of general intelligence. He has also suggested that Type 2 thinking enables uniquely human facilities, such as hypothetical thinking, mental simulation, and consequential decision making2 (Evans, 2007a, 2010b).”2\n“As reviewed above, Keith Stanovich, together with his collaborator Rich West, has focused much of his research program on individual differences in both cognitive ability (linked with IQ) and thinking dispositions, showing selective correlations with responses on a wide range of reasoning and decision-making tasks (Stanovich, 1999, 2009b, 2011; Stanovich & West, 2000). Central to his dual-processing argument is that Type 2 aspects of performance on such tasks are selectively correlated with intelligence measures, whereas features attributed to Type 1 processing are largely independent of such measures. Because working memory capacity and general intelligence are known to be highly correlated, this framework is easily reconciled with Evans’s emphasis on the engagement of working memory in Type 2 processing. Stanovich (Stanovich, 2011; Stanovich & Toplak, 2012) has also strongly emphasized the features that he calls “cognitive decoupling” in his definition of Type 2 processing. This is again compatible with Evans’s (2007a, 2010b) view that such processing is necessary for hypothetical thought. In order to reason hypothetically, we must be able to prevent our representations of the real world from becoming confused with representations of imaginary situations. The so-called cognitive decoupling operations are the central feature of Type 2 processing that makes this possible according to Stanovich (2009b, 2011).”2"

The “Other” category consists of any other neurologic findings attributed to MS and is dichotomous, with 0 as none and 1 as any present. In contrast, the total EDSS score is determined by two factors: gait and FS scores.\nEDSS scores below 4.0 are determined by the FS scores alone. People with EDSS scores of 4.0 and above may have some degree of gait impairment. Scores between 4.0 and 9.5 are determined by both gait abilities and the FS scores. For simplicity, many experts gauge the EDSS scores between 4.0 and 9.5 entirely by gait, without considering the FS scores. The EDSS is widely used and accepted as a valid tool to clinically measure and evaluate MS patients’ level of functioning."

The cranial portion then branches off as the internal ramus and joins the vagus nerve to supply the pharynx and larynx. The external ramus enters the neck between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. It then penetrates and supplies the sternocleidomastoid muscle and emerges near the middle of the posterior border of the muscle. The ramus then crosses the posterior cervical triangle to supply the trapezius muscle. In its course the nerve receives branches from the second, third, and fourth cervical nerves. The innervation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle may be more complex than is usually quoted. For example, there was residual sternocleidomastoid movement in 9 out of 15 cases where a division of the spinal components of the accessory nerve and the upper cervical motor roots was made as treatment for spasmodic torticollis [29]. It is postulated that this residual innervation was likely of vagal origin.”1\n“The fibers from the cervical segments merge to form a trunk. The spinal root enters the posterior fossa of the cranium through the foramen magnum. Here, the spinal root briefly joins the cranial (internal) root to form a single nerve trunk, the accessory nerve. The accessory nerve exits the jugular foramen, heading toward the retrostyloid space.7 From here the nerve divides into the cranial and spinal portions of the accessory nerve. The spinal accessory nerve typically passes laterally to the internal jugular vein.9–11 Although less frequent, the nerve can also pass medially,11 through,11,12 or split around11 the internal jugular vein. The nerve then descends in an oblique manner, staying medial to the styloid process, stylohyoid, and digastric muscles.6 From here the nerve most commonly travels through the two heads of the SCM muscle,7 but could also travel between the two heads of the muscle.13 In this region, the nerve merges with fibers from C2 to C4.7,14–16 Then, the nerve travels obliquely through the posterior triangle toward the deep cervical fascia and trapezius muscle, staying in a fat layer in between the trapezius and levator scapulae muscles.6,13”2"

    "section": "Supranuclear Lesions",
    "text": "Supranuclear Lesions\n“In hemispheric lesions resulting in contralateral hemiplegia, the trapezius muscle on the side of the hemiplegia is paretic. However, the head is turned away from the hemiplegic side indicating paresis of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the side opposite the hemiplegia (i.e., ipsilateral to the cerebral lesion). Focal seizures, particularly those arising in areas 8 and 9 of the cerebral cortex, cause contraction of the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle as the head turns to the side contralateral to the epileptogenic lesion (adversive seizures). Head turning without head tilting, the most common pattern observed, has been explained as an isolated contraction of the sternomastoid portion of the muscle, with less contribution from the cleidomastoid portion, which tilts the axis of the head forward and toward the ipsilateral side while exerting less rotational force [34]. Because the sternocleidomastoid muscle receives a strong input from the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, cortical, capsular, and high brainstem lesions affecting corticobulbar fibers may result in decreased strength on the head turning away from the side of the lesion [51,77].”1\n“Bender et al. suggest that the pathway for sternocleidomastoid control crosses from the hemisphere to the opposite pons and then returns to the side of the cord ipsilateral to the hemisphere of origin [5]. Geschwind points out that this second decussation may well be located in the decussation of the pyramids and that the side of sternocleidomastoid paresis in relation to the side of the hemiplegia may be of localizing significance [26]. That is, when the hemiplegic side is contralateral to the paretic sternocleidomastoid muscle, a hemispheric lesion is likely, the descending pathway being affected above its double decussation. On the other hand, hemiplegia associated with ipsilateral (to the hemiplegia) sternocleidomastoid paresis implies a lesion at or below the pontine level (i.e., after the first decussation on the descending pathway). Thus, medullary lesions affecting corticobulbar fibers may result in decreased strength on the head turning toward the lesion [51].”1\n“Cases of dissociated weakness of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles with neurologic lesions have been described, including several syndromes that are of localizing value [49]:”1\n\n“Weakness of the trapezius on one side associated with weakness of the sternocleidomastoid on the other side (dissociated weakness) indicates an upper motor neuron lesion ipsilateral to the weak sternocleidomastoid and above the oculomotor complex.”1\n“Weakness of the trapezius on one side with sparing of the sternocleidomastoid muscles indicates a ventral brainstem lesion (the supranuclear fibers to the trapezius are ventral to those to the sternocleidomastoid), a lower cervical cord lesion (due to the somatotopic arrangement of the lower motor neurons and nuclear cell column of the trapezius being below that of the sternocleidomastoid), or a lower spinal accessory root lesion (sparing upper roots to the sternocleidomastoid).”1\n“Weakness of the sternocleidomastoid with trapezius sparing indicates a lesion of the lower brainstem tegmentum (sparing ventral supranuclear fibers to the trapezius) or upper cervical accessory roots (sparing lower cervical roots to the trapezius).”1\n“Weakness of the sternocleidomastoid and the trapezius muscles on the same side indicates a contralateral brainstem lesion, an ipsilateral high cervical cord lesion, or an accessory nerve lesion before the nerve divides into its sternocleidomastoid and trapezius branches.”1\n“Weakness in one muscle only (sternocleidomastoid or trapezius) may occur with lesions of the accessory nerve distal to its bifurcation (e.g., lesion of the branch of the accessory nerve to the trapezius).”1\n\n“Head-turning movements have been analyzed in relation to the actions of the two divisions of the sternocleidomastoid muscle: the sternomastoid division and the cleidomastoid division [32]. The sternomastoid division runs obliquely and posteriorly from the sternum to insert on the occiput; it acts mainly on the atlantoaxial joint to rotate the head around a vertical axis so that the face points upward and outward over the contralateral shoulder. The cleidomastoid division originates from the clavicle and runs vertically to insert into the mastoid; it acts mainly on the middle cervical joints below C4 to tilt the axis of the head forward and toward the ipsilateral side, exerting little rotational force. Cleidomastoid contraction thus causes the face to point downward to the same side. When both divisions are activated simultaneously, there is an ipsiversive downward head tilt together with a contraversive rotation of the face. In 12 (75%) of 16 patients with surgically confirmed lateralized seizure foci, the face rotated upward and contraversive to the hemisphere of seizure origin, consistent with activation of the ipsilateral sternomastoid muscle. One patient showed a sustained, downward ipsiversive head tilt consistent with activation of the ipsilateral cleidomastoid muscle, and three patients had a combined ipsiversive head tilt and contraversive face rotation. No patient exhibited ipsiversive upward face rotation or contraversive head tilting, as would be expected if the contralateral sternocleidomastoid were activated. These findings indicate that hemispheric seizure foci activate one or both divisions of the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle and that accurate lateralization of the seizure focus is possible only when ictal head deviation is assessed in the context of the different actions of the two divisions [34].”1"

Thus, the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid paresis is associated with dysphonia and dysphagia, loss of taste on the ipsilateral posterior third of the tongue, ipsilateral palatal paresis, an ipsilateral depressed gag reflex, ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis, and ipsilateral tongue paresis and atrophy (the protruded tongue deviates to the side of the lesion). A mass lesion in this location may also directly compress the upper cervical cord or lower medulla, resulting in “intramedullary” dysfunction. The most common etiologies for spinal accessory nerve involvement within the skull and foramen magnum include extramedullary neoplasms, meningitis, and trauma.”1\n\n\nJugular Foramen Syndrome (Vernet Syndrome) and Associated Syndromes\nThe spinal accessory nerve enters the jugular foramen accompanied by cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) and cranial nerve X (vagus nerve). Therefore, lesions at the jugular foramen (e.g., basal skull fracture, tumors, infections, sarcoidosis) [14,28,40,57,70] result in a syndrome (Vernet syndrome) characterized by the following:\n\n“Ipsilateral trapezius and sternocleidomastoid paresis and atrophy”1\n“Dysphonia and dysphagia with an absent or depressed gag reflex and a palatal droop on the affected side; paralysis of the homolateral vocal cord”1\n“Loss of taste over the posterior third of the tongue on the involved side”1\n“Depressed sensation (e.g., anesthesia) on the posterior third of the tongue, soft palate, uvula, pharynx, and larynx”1\n\n“Lesions affecting the spinal accessory nerve just after it leaves the skull (in the retroparotid or retropharyngeal space) may also involve cranial nerves IX, X, and XII and the nearby sympathetic chain in variable combinations. The resulting syndromes vary and may also be seen with lesions of multiple cranial nerves within the skull and even with intramedullary lesions. Involvement of all four of the lower cranial nerves (IX through XII) results in the Collet–Sicard syndrome (all findings are ipsilateral to the site of injury), which consists of the following:”1\n\n“Paralysis of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid (cranial nerve XI)”1\n“Paralysis of the vocal cord (cranial nerve X) and pharynx (cranial nerve IX)”1\n“Hemiparalysis of the tongue (cranial nerve XII)”1\n“Loss of taste on the posterior third of the tongue (cranial nerve IX)”1\n“Hemianesthesia of the palate, pharynx, and larynx (cranial nerves IX and X)”1\n\n“A case of Collet–Sicard syndrome has been described associated with traumatic atlas fractures and congenital basilar invagination [32].”1\n“Lesions of the retroparotid or retropharyngeal spaces may cause Villaret syndrome (affecting cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII, the sympathetic chain, and occasionally cranial nerve VII). Villaret syndrome has been described due to a carotid-artery dissection and an associated aneurysm [10].”1\n“The descriptions of other syndromes involving cranial nerves IX through XII and the sympathetic chain vary widely in the literature; Table 13 1 describes some of these syndromes. Cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII may also be variably involved with neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage–Turner syndrome) [60].”1\n\nSyndromes involving CN9-12 (CN IX-XII) from Table 13-11\n\n\nSyndrome (Eponym)\nNerves Affected\nLocation of Lesion\n\n\n\n\nCollet-Sicard\nCN IX, X, XI, XII1\nRetroparotid space usually  Lesion may be intracranial or extracranial1\n\n\nVillaret\nCN IX, X, XI, XII  Plus the sympathetic chain  CN VII is occassionally involved1\nRetroparotid or retropharyngeal space1\n\n\nSchmidt\nCN IX & X1\nUsually intracranial before nerve fibers leave the skull;  Occassionally inferior margin of jugular foramen1\n\n\nJackson\nCN IX, X, & XI1\nMay be intraparenchymal (medulla);  Usually intracranial before nerve fibers leave the skull1\n\n\nTapia\nCN X & XII  (CNXI and the sympathetic chain are occassionally involved)1\nUsually high in the neck1\n\n\nGarcin (hemibase syndrome)\nAll Cranial Nerves on one side  (often incomplete)1\nOften infiltrative;  Arising from base of skull (especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma)1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nClinical presentations vary depending on which cranial nerves are involved1.

    "section": "Lesions of the Spinal Accessory Nerve within the Neck",
    "text": "Lesions of the Spinal Accessory Nerve within the Neck\nIsolated CNXI Spinal Accessory nerve palsy can occur in the neck due to Iatrogenic causes1. Surgery or internal jugular vein cannulation in the posterior triangle, carotid endarterectomy, surgery for cervicofacial lift, and coronary artery bypass surgery1. Radiation therapy has also been shown to cause CNXI Palsy1.\nBee stings can cause CNXI Palsy1.\nTrauma can also cause isolated CNXI palsy such as: blunt trauma to the shoulder, attempted hanging, gunshot injury, shoulder dislocation, with other trauma, or after nerve stretch (i.e., quickly turning the head while the shoulders are tractioned by heavy hand-held objects)1.\n\nPresentation\n\nNerve injury in the neck proximal to the SCM results in ipsilateral weakness of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles without affecting other cranial nerves1.\nNerve injury in the neck distal to the SCM result in trapezius weakness occurs in isolation1.\n\nTraction or other injuries to the posterior cervical triangle can cause CNXI injury distal to the SCM1\n\n\n“Iatrogenic injury to the spinal accessory nerve is, thus, not uncommon during neck surgery involving the posterior cervical triangle, because its superficial course here makes it susceptible [11]. In a retrospective review of 111 patients with spinal accessory nerve injury, the most frequent injury mechanism was iatrogenic (103 patients, 93%), and 82 (80%) of these injuries involved lymph node biopsies [42]. Eight injuries were caused by stretch (five patients) and laceration (three patients).”1\n“Patients may develop manifestations of neurovascular compression upon arm abduction, associated with unilateral droopy shoulder and trapezius muscle weakness caused by iatrogenic spinal accessory neuropathies following cervical lymph node biopsies [1]. One patient developed a cold, numb hand with complete axillary artery occlusion when his arm was abducted to 90 degree. Another patient complained of paresthesias in digits 4 and 5 of the right hand, worsened by elevation of the arm, with nerve conduction findings of right lower trunk plexopathy. These two cases demonstrate that unilateral droopy shoulder secondary to trapezius muscle weakness may cause compression of the thoracic outlet structures [1].”1\n“Neuromyotonia of accessory nerve, characterized by transient involuntary tonic contractures of the sternocleidomastoid muscle with head movements, has been described after radiation therapy [76]. These head movements, which occur either spontaneously or are triggered by movements, are associated with muscle hypertrophy and delayed relaxation of the affected muscle.”1\n“Weakness of neck extension against gravity with or without involvement of neck flexion has been called the floppy head syndrome [45], the dropped head syndrome [30,68], or head ptosis [74]. The etiologies for this syndrome include myasthenia gravis (which often affects neck flexors more than extensors), Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, motor neuron disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, syringomyelia, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, carnitine deficiency, LMNArelated congenital muscular dystrophy (L CMD) (a disorder characterized by infantile-onset myopathy due to mutations in the lamin A/C [LMNA] gene), adult-onset nemaline myopathy, primary amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Parkinson disease, choreoacanthocytosis, Huntington disease, after radiotherapy for Hodgkin disease, with selumetinib (a selective non-ATP competitive small-molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase) treatment for uveal melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, and a restrictive noninflammatory myopathy predominantly affecting the cervical paraspinal muscles, resulting in relatively isolated neck extensor weakness (isolated neck extensor myopathy)”1"

These projections probably participate together with the spinoreticular tract in a phylogenetically older pain pathway responsible for conveying the emotional and arousal aspects of pain. The spinoreticular tract terminates on the medullary–pontine reticular formation, which in turn projects to the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (centromedian nucleus). Unlike the VPL, which projects specifically in a somatotopic fashion to the primary sensory cortex, the intralaminar nuclei project diffusely to the entire cerebral cortex and are thought to be involved in behavioral arousal (see the section on the thalamus later in this chapter).”2\n\n\nLesion\n\nSince the spinothalamic tract ascends ipsilaterally for 1-2 segments before decussating and continuing contralaterally, its lesions have a unique pattern.\nA hemi cord lesion, such as brown-Sequard syndrome, will have pain and temperature loss following the dermatome of 1-2 segments on the side ipsilateral to the lesion since the ipsilateral spinothalamic tract has not yet decussated.\nAll segments 1-2 below will have contralateral loss of pain and temperature since the spinothalamic tract of the contralateral side has already decussated and is thus affected by the lesion2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Anterolateral Pathways of the Spinal Cord1\n\n\n“Smaller-diameter and unmyelinated axons carrying information about pain and temperature sense also enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root entry zone (see Figure 7.2). However, these axons make their first synapses immediately in the gray matter of the spinal cord, mainly in the dorsal horn marginal zone (lamina I) and deeper in the dorsal horn, in lamina V (see Figure 6.3B; Table 6.2). Some axon collaterals ascend or descend for a few segments in Lissauer’s tract before entering the central gray (see Figures 6.4 and 7.2). Axons from the second-order sensory neurons in the central gray cross over in the spinal cord anterior (ventral) commissure to ascend in the anterolateral white matter. It should be noted that it takes two to three spinal segments for the decussating fibers to reach the opposite side, so a lateral cord lesion will affect contralateral pain and temperature sensation beginning a few segments below the level of the lesion. The anterolateral pathways in the spinal cord have a somatotopic organization (see Figure 7.3) in which the feet are most laterally represented. To help you remember this organization, picture fibers from the anterior commissure adding on medially as the anterolateral pathways ascend in the spinal cord. This somatotopic organization, with arms more medial and legs more lateral, is preserved as the anterolateral pathways pass through the brainstem. When they reach the medulla, the anterolateral pathways are located laterally, running in the groove between the inferior olives and the inferior cerebellar peduncles (see Figures 7.2 and 14.5). They then enter the pontine tegmentum to lie just lateral to the medial lemniscus in the pons and midbrain (see Figures 14.3 and 14.4).”1\nThe anterolateral pathways consist of three tracts: 1. Spinothalamic Tract 1. Spinoreticular Tract 1. Spinomesencephalic Tract\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Blumenfeld H. Neuroanatomy Through Clinical Cases. 3rd ed.

    "text": "Definition\nPain associated with cancer includes pain associated with disease progression as well as treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) that may damage the nervous system. Although some contend that pain associated with neoplastic disease is unique, in the majority of instances, we view it as fitting within our description of acute and chronic pain, as depicted in Figure 2.1. Moreover, pain associated with cancer can have multiple causes, namely, disease progression, treatment, and co-occurring diseases (e.g., arthritis). Regardless of whether the pain associated with cancer stems from disease progression, treatment, or a cooccurring disease, it may be either acute or chronic. Thus, we do not advocate a separate classification of cancer pain as distinct from acute and chronic pain. Some concerns have also been raised regarding the common usage of chronic malignant and chronic benign pain4; often, pain unrelated to cancer is implicitly view as “benign” to distinguish it from cancer-related pain. Certainly, people who have pain associated with neoplastic disease experience a unique and disease-specific situation, but from a mechanistic perspective, there may be little to substantiate continued use of this dichotomy. Moreover, patients who have chronic noncancer pain who are told that their pain is “benign” may feel denigrated because, from their perspective, the inference is that their pain is not a serious concern.1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Once this occurs, the noxious stimuli is sent through the nerve ending to the 2nd order neuron in the spinal cord, where other unrelated nerves also converge2. As a result of this convergence, the brain may receive these noxious stimuli and mistakenly perceive pain as originating from one of the other nerves that converges at that 2nd order neuron2.\nSomatic referred pain is generally perceived as dull, aching, gnawing, and/or expanding pressure2.\nSomatic referred pain generally covers a wide area and is difficult to localize but a patient can easily identify center/core2.\nOnce established, somatic referred pain is fixed and will not migrate2. Segmental maps are not consistent between studies/amongst subjects\nThe pattern of somatic referred pain is not dermatomal, since this would be irritation of the nerve/nerve root relevant to the site of noxious stimuli and would be considered radicular pain2.\nIn cases of low back somatic referred pain, patients the symptoms are generally in the gluteal region and proximal thigh but some cases extend as far as the foot2.\nThe somatic referred pain pattern corresponds to segmental innervation of deep tissues in limb like muscles/joints2."

Chronic pain extends for a long period of time and/or represents low levels of underlying pathology that does not explain the presence and extent of pain (e.g., mechanical back pain, fibromyalgia [FM] syndrome)2. There have been suggestions that chronic pain in the apparent absence of pathology may be attributable to modification of nerves and sensitization of the peripheral or central nervous system2. There have also been suggestions that genetic factors and prior life experiences might predispose some to develop chronic pain problems following an initiating insult that resolves in others who do not have the predisposition2. Just as the brain is modified by experience, especially in early life, the brain may alter the way noxious information is processed to reduce or augment its impact on subjective awareness2. Chronic pain frequently is the impetus for people to seek health care. Currently available treatments are rarely capable of totally eliminating the noxious sensations and thereby “curing” chronic pain2. Because the pain persists, it is likely that environmental, emotional, and cognitive factors will interact with the already sensitized nervous system, contributing to the persistence of pain and associated illness behaviors (see following description of pain behaviors)2. It is also possible that, just as the brain is modified by experience, especially in early life, the brain may alter the way noxious information is processed to reduce or augment its impact on subjective awareness2."

    "text": "Progressive overload is a basic concept in physical training. Generally, we increase our training load by increasing the amount of weight in order to get stronger, number of repetitions in order to build endurance, speed to build power, or complexity to build stability and coordination. These are all important in athletic performance, but focusing your training solely around these purely physical parameters may leave you unprepared for the mental load of game-time situations.\nDuring training, you can focus almost all of your attention on the task and maintaining proper form, but during a game or daily life, you will be experiencing distractions that will pull your attention away from your form.\nThis is where dual-task training is important.\n\nWhat is Dual-task training?\nA dual-task refers to the ability to perform two tasks at the same time. Dual-task training is based on Dual-process theory1. Dual-process theory proposes that when performing multiple tasks, the human peformance is determined by two types of processing systems: Automatic processing and controlled processing1,2. Automatic processing refers to the intuitive and fast forms of processing that use low amounts of attentional resources2. Automatic processing is reactive to triggers for example the question “What is your name”2. Opposite of automatic processing, controlled processing is slow and requires conscious interpretation of requisite information and processing as well as the attentional control to complete the task2.\nDual-tasks involve the simultaneous performance of both automatic and controlled processing2. Dual-tasks are relevant in everyday life when walking and talking. Walking is primarily an automatic task while talking requires controlled processing. In sports, a soccer player could receive the ball, realize his teammate is open, assess the positions of opponents, and pass the ball2. Dribbling and passing the ball are automatic processes for experienced soccer players2. Assessing the field for open teammates, opponents, and considering the team’s strategy would require controlled processing2.\nDual-task training has 3 forms:\n\nCognitive-Motor Dual task\nMotor-motor dual task\nCognitive-Cognitive Dual task\n\n\n\nDual-task cost\nDual-task cost refers to the decrease in performance of either task when performing both tasks simultaneously2. Acutely, dual-task cost should result in significant detriments in performance2. When dual-tasks are performed chronically, adaptations will occur and the dual-task cost will be minimized2.\n\\[\n\\textrm{Dual-Task Cost Equation} =  \\frac{(\\textrm{DT} − \\textrm{ST})}{\\textrm{ST}} \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\nSport performance\nSports are one of the main examples of activities that innately have dual-tasks due to the complex and dynamic environments. To have success in a sport, an athlete must simultaneously consider themself, the ball, teammates, opponents, rules, and situational requirements such as attacking or defending3. When competing in a sport, there could be even more variables such as referees, coaches, spectators, and competitive pressure3.\nAttentional overload in sports can come in many forms. Attentional overload causing cognitive failure during a motor-cognitive task could take the form of a player focusing on their movement and not on their surroundings. As a result, this athlete would have poor situational awareness and would move well, but make poor decisions.\nAttentional overload causing motor failure during a cognitive-motor task would be exemplified by a player focusing on their surroundings and the other players, but losing focus on their motor pattern, resulting in a mistake and even injury.\n\n\nWorking memory capacity in elite athletes\nThe ability to dual-task is impacted by working memory capacity (WMC), the ability to inhibit irrelevant information2. An individual with low working memory capacity refers to individuals who struggle to ignore irrelevant factors2. Whereas someone with high working memory capacity refers to individuals who have strong focus and attention and can filter out what information is important for future decisions2.\nImproving one’s working memory capacity can result in significant performance benefits. When elite, intermediate, and non-athlete basketball players were analyzed on a multiple object tracking (MOT) test in order to measure attentional skills that mimic the cognitive load of tracking the ball, teammates, and opponents simultaneously on the court4. MOT is a cognitive task where participants attempt to track 2, 3, and 4 objects at once4. Each successive increase in number of objects increases the attentional load4. There was no significant difference between the groups when tracking 2 objects, indicating that attentional load was not high enough to affect performance4. When the load was increased to 3 and 4 objects, the elite basketball players performed significantly better than the intermediate and non-athlete players4.\n\n\nChoking\nChoking is a common problem in competitive sports and refers to performance breakdowns due to perceived pressure of competition5. This can occur at any level, from amateur to professional5\nWhen viewed through the context of dual-process theory, choking appears to be a form of dual-task interference. As the perceived pressure of competition increases, this adds an extra load to the attentional resources5. This process is also influenced by poor inhibition of perceived pressure5. If the athlete cannot mentally adapt and mitigate this cognitive load, this will force the attention to be taken away from areas focused on sport performance resulting in poor decision making and/or poor motor patterning. Performance breakdown due to competitive pressures is most noticeable in closed tasks such as basketball free throws or golf putting where there should be very few factors taking up attentional resources. Many athletes blame themselves and assume they need to “push” through the barrier or simply continue their training program but at higher intensity to overcome choking.\nBased on dual-process theory, focusing on single-task more intensely will not provide a meaningful benefit to one’s working memory capacity and therefore choking will persist. For these athletes, dual-task training can help to improve working memory capacity and reduce choking. Ducrocq et al.5 found that 10 sessions of computer-based dual-task training resulted in a significant improvement in tennis shot accuracy under pressure compared controls5.\n\n\nInjury prevention\nIn a systematic review by Gonzalez-Millan et al., dual-task costs during jumping resulted in a stiffer landing at the joint level resulting in increased vertical ground reaction forces and peak joint torques, a decrease in peak knee and hip flexion angles, and overall reduced stability and postural control6. These results suggest that dual-tasking during jumping is associated with injury risk6. Since dual-task is an inherent aspect of sports, it should be trained to create chronic adaptations and improvements in working memory capacity in order to reduce dual-task cost and therefore injury during sport.\nNess et al. found that neurocognitive deficiencies in reaction time and visual processing speed were predictive of future ACL injury which supports the idea that low working memory capacity can increase injury risk7.\n\n\nTransfer to sport performance\nFledderman et al. tested the effect of dual-task cost on competitive beach volleyball players3. When performing jump-blocks as a single task, low load dual task, or high load dual task, the players demonstrated worse jumping performance with each successive task3. Based on these results, Fledderman concluded that the secondary cognitive task took attentional resources away from the motor action of jumping resulting in worse performance3.\nFledderman then sampled another group of volleyball players and had them perform multiple object tracking (MOT) dual task training for 8 weeks8. After 8 weeks of dual-task training, there was a statistically significant improvement in cognitive skills of sustained attention and processing speed8. There was no significant difference in the volleyball-specific jump task8. This indicates that although the athletes improved their attention and processing speed, these cognitive skills did not reduce the dual-task cost during the jump-block8. In a similar study, soccer athletes were given 10 sessions of 3D-multiple object tracking (3D-MOT) and demonstrated significantly more improvement in passing decision-making accuracy than controls but no difference in dribbling or shooting9.\nThe multiple object tracking (MOT) intervention consists of a participant attempting to follow multiple objects on a screen at once without losing track of any of the objects8,9. Fledderman’s MOT intervention significantly improved cognitive function but did not transfer to jump-block ability. Romeas’ MOT intervention did not improve soccer dribbling or shooting ability. The 3D-MOT training did significantly improve passing ability of the soccer players, which is a skill that requires observation of multiple moving objects at once9. This shows the importance of finding dual-task training that transfers to sport specific skills.\n\n\nImportance in daily life\nDual-task training has applications far past sport performance. Elderly individuals demonstrated a significant improvement in fall risk within 6 weeks of dual-task gait training10. The importance of preventing falls in the elderly cannot be understated. Sylliaas et al. found that when an individual has more than 2 falls a year, this significantly increases risk of death11\n\n\nImportance in Rehabilitation\nDual-task training also plays a role in rehabilitation. Traumatic injuries, such as ACL tears are associated with alterations in sensorimotor cortical activation7. Ness et al. found that these changes can persist for months and even years following injury or surgery7. post-op ACLR patients demonstrated no differences in postural stability during single task balance exercises when compared to controls7. However, during dual-task balance exercises, these patients would sacrifice cognitive ability to maintain postural stability7.\nThese results indicate that relying solely on single tasks during balance can overestimate an individual’s physical ability. Performing balance exercises and measuring physical efficacy as well as cognitive accuracy would better demonstrate the dual-task cost and potential re-injury risks.\n\n\n\nResources for exercise ideas\n\nKevin Wilk, DPT\n\ndual task SLB with catches\ndual task blazepod catch and touch example\ndual task SLB with catches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Kevin Wilk, DPT, FAPTA (wilk_kevin?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Kevin Wilk, DPT, FAPTA (wilk_kevin?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Pain is elicited by the injury of body tissues and activation of nociceptive transducers at the site of local tissue damage2. The local injury alters the response characteristics of the nociceptors and perhaps their central connections and the autonomic nervous system in the region2. In general, the state of acute pain lasts for a relatively limited time and remits when the underlying pathology resolves2. This type of pain often serves as the impetus to seek health care, and it occurs following trauma, some disease processes, and invasive interventions2."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\n\nWelzak Chapter 69 Central Pain1\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n“Central pain is defined as pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system in the central nervous system (CNS) and can be due to multiple causes such as stroke, injury, inflammation, congenital abnormalities, and immunological disorders. Although the underlying causes differ, central pain conditions seem to share the same two basic clinical characteristics: (1) partial or complete loss of sensation to spinothalamic functions, such as cold, warm, and pinprick sensitivity, and (2) development of hypersensitivity in body parts that have been deprived of their normal somatosensory information as a result of the CNS lesion. The pain may occur immediately or be delayed for weeks or months after the CNS lesion and can be both spontaneous and evoked, as well as both superficial and deep. Many patients with central pain complain of unpleasant sensations rather than frank pain. The pain is often described as burning, pricking, lancinating, icy, tearing, cutting, and squeezing, but no specific set of descriptors permits the diagnosis of central pain. Diagnosis requires a careful history and clinical examination, including a sensory examination, often supplemented by imaging studies to document a relevant pain-provoking lesion within the somatosensory system of the CNS. Quantitative sensory testing may occasionally be helpful to document the combination of both sensory loss and associated hypersensitivity in the body parts affected by pain. The mechanisms of central pain are not known, but the main hypotheses are (1) disinhibition, (2) sensitization, and (3) neuroplastic “maladaptive” changes in cell populations or structures within the CNS because of the loss of normal somatosensory input. Management of central pain is based on pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, both aiming at reducing symptoms and signs of neuronal hyperexcitability in the CNS.”1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "In human skin, for example, there exist nociceptors that respond only to mechanical, only to cold thermal, or only to hot thermal stimuli as well as those that are insensitive to both mechanical and heat stimuli (mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors)1\nThe most abundant is the polymodal nociceptor, which responds to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. In general, nociceptors that innervate skin have the broadest range of modality selectivity1\nnociceptors innervating deeper structures tend to be less modality-selective and more polymodal in character. For example, mechanical sensitivity is a prominent feature of visceral and joint nociceptors because stimuli adequate for their activation include hollow organ distension and overrotation, respectively1.\nMany of these nociceptors also respond to chemical and/or thermal stimuli as well, although the functional significance of thermal sensitivity in deep tissues is uncertain1.\nAn important characteristic of polymodal nociceptors, whether the modalities of stimulation to which they respond are two or all three, is that when sensitized (e.g., by an inflammatory insult), responses to the other modality or modalities of stimuli to which it responds are all increased\n\nMechanosensitivity\nNociceptors with low mechanical thresholds for response and those with very high mechanical thresholds for response (i.e., sleeping nociceptors) are both clinically important.\nMechanosensitive sensory neurons with low thresholds for response have long been classified as “non-nociceptors” (because it was considered that nociceptors had to have response thresholds in the noxious range)1.\nSome mechanosensitive skin, joint, and many visceral sensory neurons have low thresholds for response (i.e., in the nonnoxious range) but possess characteristics that suggest an important role in pain.\n\nFirst: these low-threshold receptors encode stimulus intensity well into the noxious range and, moreover, typically give greater responses to all intensities of stimulation than do nociceptors with high mechanical thresholds for response1.\nSecond: they sensitize after tissue insult. Unlike nociceptors with low mechanical thresholds, mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors normally provide no information to the central nervous system but after tissue insult become spontaneously active and mechanosensitive1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Our distinction between acute and chronic pain using the integration of the dimensions of time and pathology does not specifically include recurrent pain. In the case of recurrent pain, patients may experience episodes of pain interspersed with periods of being completely pain-free. Although recurrent pain may seem acute because each pain episode (e.g., headache) is of relatively short duration, the pathophysiology of many recurrent pain disorders (e.g., migraine) is not well understood. Syndromes characterized by recurrent acute pain share features in common with both acute and chronic pain. The fact that these syndromes extend over time, however, suggests that psychosocial and behavioral factors, not only physical pathology, may be major contributors to emotional and behavioral responses. IASP4 now includes recurrent pain lasting longer than 3 months within its definition of chronic pain. However, it is not clear whether multiple episodes lasting several days within 3 months would meet the chronic pain criterion or whether the pain must last at least 3 months. That is, would multiple migraines in a 3-month period be chronic even if there were pain-free periods within the 3 month period?1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Ballantyne J, Fishman S, Rathmell JP, eds.

    "text": "Sensory Pathway\n\n\n\nTrigeminal Sensory System Nuclei and Pathways (from Blumenfeld figure 12.81)\n\n\n\nSomatosensory afferent nerves convey crude touch, pain, and temperature sensation from the face and mouth to the lateral pons1.\nThese nerve fibers then descend the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus1.\n. Similarly, the spinal trigeminal tract is analogous to Lissauer’s tract (see Figures 6.4 and 7.2). Secondary sensory neurons from the spinal trigeminal nucleus cross the brainstem to ascend as the trigeminothalamic tract (or ventral trigeminothalamic tract). The trigeminothalamic tract is analogous to the spinothalamic tract (see Table 12.6), and the pathways travel together to the thalamus (see Figures 12.8 and 14.3). Trigeminothalamic tract fibers synapse in the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), and tertiary sensory neurons then travel in the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex. Like the anterolateral systems in the spinal cord, there are also pathways from the spinal trigeminal nucleus to intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the reticular formation, and other areas, to mediate the affective and arousal aspects of facial pain.\n\nIn summary, it is generally believed that sensory fibers involved in the conduction of pain and temperature spread over the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and then cross over to the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex5"

The patient received natural and synthetic antibiotics and steroids to resolve the acute signs of infection, but this did not yield any functional improvement2. Rongies et al., found full and rapid resolution of extraocular paralysis and diploplia using periorbital hydrocortisone iontophoresis, visuomotor exercises combined with intense ideomotor stimulation2.\nInterventions\n\nIontophoresis\n\nIontophoretic treatment of various ophthalmic conditions2.\nUsed as a means of noninvasive, transdermal drug delivery\nPerformed in the orbital region affected by extraocular muscle palsy ( The selected technique of ocular iontophoresis was indirect, through a closed eyelid)2.\nDrug: Corhydron 100 [hydrocortisone] at 50 mg/5mL of a sodium chloride solution as a solvent2.\nThe procedure used direct (or galvanic) current.\nDuration of each single iontophoresis procedure was 20 minutes2\nPt position: Upright sitting position with head and forearms supported (to enable observation of autonomic nervous system related adverse effects)2.\n\nExercise\n\nExercise performed immediately after iontophoresis2.\n30-minute set of PT supervised exercises2.\nBreaks\n\nAllowed if: 1. Pt reported feeling of muscle fatigue or 2. distinct deceleration of eyeball movements was observed\nFrequency of breaks: gradually decreased from every several seconds to every 2 minutes\n\nExercise Type: Attempts to follow with the gaze an object (patient’s hand) moving diagonally in space (in alternate pattern), with additional simultaneous ideomotor stimulation2.\nThe amplitude of movement progressively increased during the rehabilitation sessions. The patient performed his exercises in sitting and standing positions positions which improved comfort by avoiding forced position. His head was still. Each exercise session was conducted in setting that limited the patient’s distraction. The patient was advised to perform these exercises at home 2-3 times a day. The outcome measures for this study were the range of eye movement, reaction times during eye movement and muscle endurance, in comparison with these in the unaffected eye. The results were evaluated visually by 3 independent researchers who were not involved in the process of treatment. The range of movement improvement has been documented in the picture.\n\nResults:\n\nRongies used daily physical therapy and the patient regained distinct movement within 4 days2.\nBy session 16, the patient displayed complete return of function in all paralyzed muscles2."

Therapy should begin as early as possible while the patient is still on the acute medical or neurological unit. Physicians, nurses, and other personnel must be involved. Therapy should not be completely delegated to physical and occupational therapists. Consultations should not be limited to the 30 minutes or so that patients typically spend each day with therapists. Passive and active range-of-motion exercises and other physical therapy should be encouraged by ward personnel. If the patient goes to a rehabilitation unit, the acute-care team should continue to follow the patient whenever possible. Acute medical problems do not suddenly disappear when the patient is transferred. Subsequent strokes and medical complications are common among recuperating patients.”1"

For scooting sideways, begin with the patient in a bridge. With the positions and hand placements described previously in bridging (Figure 34-2A), give input with one hand toward the pelvis (as if shortening the leg) and the other toward the knee (as if lengthening the leg). Maintain the upward direction cue to keep the bridge the entire time until ready to set the hips back down. Work with the patient to control the hips descending back down to the supporting surface (rather than plopping down). Assist the patient in aligning the legs with the new position of the hips; if necessary, lean the knees together so the legs can stay propped up. The patient then aligns the upper body with the lower body by lifting the head and shoulders slightly and shifting the shoulders over. You may cue the patient at the shoulders when needing assistance with upper body alignment.\n“In all cases, the patient should be doing as much of the work as possible with the therapist assisting as little as possible. When the patient needs more assistance with maintaining a bridge during the sideways scooting practice, a drawsheet can be used around his pelvis as described previously in bridging, with the addition of shortening and lengthening cues.”2\n“For scooting up in bed, again begin with a bridge. Using the position and hand placements described previously in bridging, give input with the fingers on both hands, simultaneously giving the patient the input to move the buttocks toward the head (pushing lightly toward the patient’s head). The patient can additionally assist by pushing up with both feet and hands to slide upward.”2"

    "text": "Rolling\n“In addition to scooting, a patient needs to be able to roll in both directions for independence in bed mobility. Although typically used for bed mobility, rolling is also used for dressing in individuals who cannot dress in sitting or standing, for pressure relief in individuals who are unable to bridge, and to decrease general tone when done slowly and rhythmically”2\n“Biomechanical factors include a large base of support that can be increased with an arm on the mat and a low center of gravity. The ATNR or TLR will interfere with normal rolling if present, whereas intact righting reflexes will assist with rolling. When moving from supine toward prone, gravity resists the supine-to-sidelying portion of the movement and assists the sidelying-to-prone movement.”2\n“Begin by asking the individual to roll. When the patient presents with hemiparesis, ask him to roll toward the lessinvolved side. What strategy does the patient spontaneously try to use? If possible and appropriate, help the patient to relearn his preferred rolling strategy.”2\n“Initially, it may be easier for the patient to roll from supine to sidelying “en bloc” (log roll) rather than segmentally. When considering the patient who has experienced a stroke with one side significantly more impaired than the other, rolling onto the weaker side is easier than moving onto the uninvolved side (Franchignoni, 1997; Kafri, 2005). Because the external oblique, pectoralis major, and rectus femoris muscles play significant roles in the ability to roll to either side after a stroke, any activity or isolated muscle strengthening targeting these muscles will contribute to a patient’s overall functional success with rolling (Kafri, 2005).”2"

    "text": "Bridging\n“Bridging is a weight-bearing position for the lower extremities in supine. It is both a developmental and a functional activity essential for independent dressing and moving in bed. When working with a patient, immediately put the bridge into a function, such as lifting to scoot sideways or up in bed. Increased control for the stance phase of gait with pelvic rotation and weight shift in a more isolated movement combination (e.g., hip extension with knee flexion) can also be facilitated using this position. Biomechanical factors to consider are a higher base of support, a smaller center of gravity, and an increased number of joints involved compared with supine.”\nAssumption of the Position\n“Guide and/or resist the patient’s lower extremities into a stable flexed position with feet flat on the supporting surface. Assist the patient in lifting the lower extremity with the fingers on the lateral border of the foot and the lateral popliteal fossa. When some flexion is achieved, move the proximal hand to the anterior knee, below the patella (Fig. 34-1). Place the noninvolved leg over the top of the involved foot to assist the involved leg in bending up, and place the feet flat on the surface (you may provide pressure on the tibia to assist). Placing the assistance anteriorly rather than underneath”2\n“the leg encourages the patient to do as much of the work of lifting the leg as possible, rather than relying on the therapist to do most of the lifting or using the less-involved limb to lift the more-involved limb. Regarding foot placement, you may start with the feet apart for stability and progress toward a narrower base and/or start closer to the buttocks and progress to farther away”2\n“A compensatory strategy for the patient is moving the legs into hooklying. The patient can hook the less-involved foot under the more-involved foot and use the strength of the uninvolved leg to pull the involved leg up into hooklying.”2\n“When a patient is unable to lift her buttocks off the supporting surface, you can facilitate the lift. Position yourself facing the patient’s head and straddle her feet. Place your hands on the patient’s distal femur, providing pressure down into the feet (cuing weight-bearing) and lightly pull the femurs forward over the feet. Then give an upward lifting cue with the fingers along the lateral aspects of the distal femur. You may lean your body back to increase weight-bearing into the patient’s feet (Fig. 34-2A)”2\n“When the patient needs additional assistance, use a drawsheet around the crest of the pelvis, giving the same cues as described previously (Fig. 34-2B). Alternatively, your forearms can be placed on the patient’s femurs with weight-bearing pressure given into the patient’s feet. Then guiding the femurs forward over the feet, simultaneously lift the pelvis with the drawsheet.”2"

(through distraction, music, etc)6.\n\nClinical signs: hoovers, hip abductor sign, abolishing tremor with rhythmical movements6.\n\nExplain a wide variety of factors can cause symptoms → physical illness, injury, psych factors like anxiety/depression/trauma6.\n\nPT can retrain the NS to regain control over movement6."

Other theories in the literature have stated a psychogenic origin in nature, however, it is possible that both provide a significant contribution to PCS \n\n\nPathphysiology\nThe symptoms consistent with PCS can all result from autonomic nervous system damage1. This damage occurs to the white matter tracks between cortical control centers and vagal nerve control via the spinal cord This affects both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems\nAs a result, patients will often experience symptoms consistent with depression.\nAutonomic nervous system damage also causes difficulties with control of cerebral blood flood, blood pressure, and heart rate\nleading to dizziness, headache, confusion, difficulty with concentration, and orthostatic intolerance.\nDecreases in cerebral blood flow at rest in the immediate post-injury period can account for PCS symptoms outlined above. Also, increased cerebral blood flow post-injury can cause headaches, vision changes, and dizziness leading to exercise intolerance.\nHeart rate variability due to damage in the vagal nerve tracts results in disproportionate increases in blood pressure and heart rate during exercise causing early fatigue\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Exactly how the changing length of the internal moment arm influences the shape of the extensor torque–joint angle curve, such as that depicted in Fig. 13.26, is uncertain.

    "text": "“The proximal (or superior) tibiofibular joint is a synovial joint located lateral to and immediately inferior to the knee. The joint is formed between the head of the fibula and the posterior-lateral aspect of the lateral condyle of the tibia (see Fig. 13.4). The joint surfaces are generally flat or slightly oval, covered by articular cartilage.175 Although the proximal tibiofibular joint is functionally independent of the knee (tibiofemoral) joint, anatomic connections exist between the capsules of the two joints”1\n“A capsule strengthened by anterior and posterior ligaments and part of the tendon of the biceps femoris encloses the proximal tibiofibular joint (see Figs. 13.7 and 13.9). The tendon of the popliteus muscle provides additional stabilization as it crosses the joint posteriorly. When stressed by forces and torques generated while walking, 1–3 mm of anterior and posterior translations have been measured at this joint in cadaver specimens.162 The relative stability at this joint is needed to ensure that forces within the biceps femoris and lateral collateral ligament of the knee are transferred effectively from the fibula to the tibia. Although rare, acute dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint secondary to trauma has been described in the literature.”1\n“The proximal, or superior, tibiofibular joint (see Fig. 20-1) is an almost plane joint with a slight convexity on the oval tibial facet and a slight concavity on the fibular head. The joint is located below the tibial plateau on the lateral condyle of the tibia. The tibial articulating facet faces laterally, posteriorly, and inferiorly. Although the joint is often described as a simple, synovial, modified ovoid, it functions as a modified sellar when combined with the distal, or inferior, tibiofibular joint (see Chapter 21)”2\n“The joint capsule of the proximal tibiofibular joint complex is thicker anteriorly than posteriorly and, in 10% of the population, the synovium is continuous with that of the knee joint.1 The joint receives support from anterior and posterior ligaments and an interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane attaches between the medial border of the fibula and the lateral border of the tibia, providing attachment to the deep anterior and posterior muscles of the leg. The majority of its fibers pass obliquely in an inferior and lateral direction.”2\n“The proximal tibiofibular joint has more motion than its distal partner. The motion occurring at the proximal joint, consists of two glides, one in a superoinferior direction and the other in an anteroposterior direction.1 These motions are possible because of the orientation of the joint line, which also facilitates an osteokinematic spin of the fibula. The motion at this joint can be decreased by articular fibrosis or by softtissue restraints; the biceps femoris can pull or hold it posteriorly, whereas the tibialis anterior can pull or hold it anteriorly.”2\n“Although the capsular pattern of restriction for this joint is unclear, it is probably indicated by pain during an isometric contraction of the biceps femoris with the knee at 90 degrees of flexion. The close-packed position for this joint, equally debatable, is probably weight-bearing (WB) ankle dorsiflexion.”2\n“Both the tibia and the fibula are vulnerable to fracture at the lower third of their shaft. Anterior joint subluxations occur at this joint as a result of medial knee joint strain or an inversion sprain of the ankle. Posterior joint subluxation can occur as a result of a lateral knee joint strain, but this is often missed because of the more serious ligament damage to the knee.”2\n\n\n“The nerve supply to this joint is provided by the common fibular (peroneal) and recurrent articular nerves. The joint receives its blood supply from a perforating branch of the fibular (peroneal) artery and the anterior tibial artery.”2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Dutton, during DF the fibula glides superiorly at the proximal tibiofibular joint2"

    "text": "Depression & Elevation\n\n\n\nTMJ Depression and elevation (fig 11.151)\n\n\nOsteokinematics:\n\n“Depression of the mandible causes the mouth to open, a fundamental component of chewing (see Fig. 11.15A). Maximal opening of the mouth typically occurs during actions such as yawning and singing. In the adult the mouth can be opened an average of 45–50 mm as measured between the incisal edges of the upper and lower front teeth.18,43,97 T he interincisal opening is typically large enough to fit three adult “knuckles” (proximal interphalangeal joints). Typical mastication, however, requires an average maximal opening of 18 mm—about 38% of maximum (sufficient to accept one adult knuckle). Being unable to fit two knuckles between the edges of the upper and lower incisors is usually considered abnormal in the average sized adult. Elevation of the mandible closes the mouth—an action used to crush food during mastication (see Fig. 11.15B). During this process, the teeth within the elevating mandible strongly oppose the teeth within the fixed maxilla.”\n\nArthrokinematics:\n“Opening and closing of the mouth occur by depression and elevation of the mandible, respectively. During these movements, each TMJ experiences a combination of rotation and translation among the mandibular condyle, articular disc, and fossa. No other joint in the body experiences such a large proportion of translation and rotation. These complex arthrokinematics are a necessary mechanical component of mastication (grinding and crushing of food) and for speaking. Because rotation and translation occur simultaneously, the axis of rotation is constantly moving. In the ideal case the movements within both TMJs result in a maximal range of mouth opening with minimal stress placed on the articular surfaces.”\n\nEarly phase:\n\nfirst 35-50% of ROM1\n\n\n\n“The early phase, constituting the first 35% to 50% of the range of motion, involves primarily rotation of the mandible relative to the cranium. As depicted in Fig. 11.16A, the condyle rolls posteriorly within the concave inferior surface of the disc. (The direction of the roll is described relative to the rotation of a point on the ramus of the mandible.) The rolling motion swings the body of the mandible inferiorly and posteriorly. The axis of rotation for this motion is not fixed but migrates within the vicinity of the mandibular neck and condyle.32,77,83 The rolling motion of the condyle stretches the oblique portion of the lateral ligament, which may help initiate the late phase of opening the mouth”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIt is likely not possible to define a single rotation-to-translation kinematic of the TMJ during opening/closing due to natural intersubject variability in movement strategy and on overall cranial-dental anatomy1\n\n\n“The late phase of opening the mouth consists of the final 50% to 65% of the total range of motion. This phase is marked by a gradual transition from primary rotation to primary translation. This transition can be readily appreciated by palpating the condyle of the mandible during the full opening of the mouth. The full amount of translation is large, about 1.5 to 2 cm in the adult.18,66 During the translation, the condyle and disc slide together in a forward and inferior direction against the slope of the articular eminence (see Fig. 11.16B). At the end of opening, the axis of rotation shifts inferiorly. The exact point of the axis is difficult to define because it depends on the person’s unique rotation-totranslation ratio. At the later phase of opening, the axis is usually located below the neck of the mandible.Full opening of the mouth maximally stretches and pulls the disc anteriorly. The extent of the forward translation (protrusion) is limited, in part, by tension in the stretched, elastic superior retrodiscal lamina. The intermediate region of the disc translates forward while remaining between the superior aspect of the condyle and the articular eminence. This placement of the disc maximizes joint congruency and reduces intra-articular stress\nThe arthrokinematics of closing the mouth occur in the reverse order of that described for opening. When the mouth is fully opened and prepared to close, tension in the superior retrodiscal lamina starts to retract the disc, helping to initiate the early translational phase of closing. The later phase is dominated by rotation of the condyle within the concavity of the disc, terminated when contact is made between the upper and lower teeth.”"

    "text": "The atlanto-axial joint complex has two articular components: a median joint and a pair of laterally positioned apophyseal joints. The median joint is formed by the dens of the axis (C2) projecting through an osseous-ligamentous ring created by the anterior arch of the atlas and the transverse ligament (Fig. 9.43). Because the dens serves as a vertical axis for horizontal plane rotation of the atlas, the atlanto-axial joint is often described as a pivot joint.\nThe median joint within the atlanto-axial joint complex has two synovial cavities. The smaller, anterior cavity is formed between the anterior side of the dens and the posterior border of the anterior arch of the atlas (see Fig. 9.43). An anterior facet on the anterior side of the dens marks this articulation (see Fig. 9.20A). The much larger posterior cavity separates the posterior side of the dens and a cartilage-lined section of the transverse ligament of the atlas. This strong, 2-cm long ligament is essential to the horizontal plane stability of the atlanto-axial articulation.35 Without its restraint, the atlas (and articulated cranium) can slip anteriorly relative to the axis, possibly damaging the spinal cord.\n\nROM Assessment\n\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYomogida N, Kerstein C.

C8 root involvement results in pain in the medial arm and forearm. With C8 lesions [40], sensory signs and symptoms occur on the medial forearm and hand and on the fifth digit. Paresis occurs predominantly and variably in the following muscles: flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus I to IV, pronator quadratus, abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, all lumbricals, flexor carpi ulnaris, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, all interossei, adductor pollicis, extensor digiti minimi, extensor carpi ulnaris, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis longus and brevis, and extensor indicis (see Chapter 2 for examination methods of these muscles). The finger flexor reflex (C8 T1) may be depressed. Sympathetic fibers destined for the superior cervical ganglia are interrupted, resulting in an ipsilateral Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis).”3\n“There are frequent intradural communicating fibers between neighboring segments of the cervical posterior roots. These connections are most prominent between a specific cervical segment and the next caudal root. A lesion may therefore be falsely localized clinically to a segment one level higher than its actual location.”3\n“The theoretical root syndromes discussed earlier are also related to an “idealized” brachial plexus and do not take into consideration the possibility of a prefixed or postfixed plexus (see Chapter 3 ).”3\n\n\nExamination\n“The patient extends the thumb just short of the full range of motion. The clinician stabilizes the patient’s wrist with one hand and applies an isometric force into thumb flexion with the other (Fig. 25-29).”4\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A monoradiculopathy affecting the C6 nerve root is the second most common level of cervical radiculopathy after lesions of the C7 level [28]. C6 root involvement results in pain in the lateral arm and dorsal forearm. Sensory signs and symptoms occur on the lateral forearm, lateral hand, and the first and second digits. Paresis occurs predominantly in the following muscles: serratus anterior, biceps, pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, supinator, and extensor carpi radialis brevis (examination of these muscles is described in Chapter 2 ). The biceps reflex (segments C5 C6) and the brachioradialis reflex (segments C5 C6) may be depressed. An “inverted radial reflex” occurs when the lesion causes compression of the spinal cord at the C5 C6 level. A central disc prolapse or a horizontal bar due to degenerative disc disease is often responsible for this clinical finding. Damage of the corticospinal tract at the level of C5 C6 results in hyperreflexia at lower levels. Therefore, tapping the tendon of the brachioradialis muscle elicits no response by the brachioradialis but a brisk contraction of the finger flexors innervated by the C8 T1 segments.”3\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "section": "",
    "text": "“The lateral meniscus, which forms a C-shaped incomplete circle,25 sits atop the convex lateral tibial plateau (see Fig. 20-2). It occupies a larger portion (approximately 80%) of the articular surface than the medial meniscus (approximately 60%) and is more mobile than its medial counterpart.23 Both horns of the lateral meniscus are attached to the tibia.23”1\n“The periphery of the lateral meniscus attaches to the tibia, the capsule, and the coronary ligament, but not to the LCL. The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus attaches to the inner aspect of the medial femoral condyle via the anterior and posterior meniscofemoral ligaments of Humphrey and Wrisberg, respectively23:”1\n\n“The ligament of Humphrey, also known as the anterior meniscofemoral ligament, runs anteriorly to the PCL and inserts on the posterior aspect of the lateral meniscus.18”1\n“The ligament of Wrisberg, also known as the posterior meniscofemoral ligament, runs posteriorly to the PCL to insert either into the superior/lateral aspect of the tibia, the posterior aspect of the lateral meniscus, or the posterior capsule.”1\n\n\nStabilization\n“The meniscofemoral ligaments become taut with internal rotation of the tibia and help with stabilization of the meniscus.1”1\n\n\nDysfunction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“The lateral meniscus often is associated with the appearance of synovial-filled cysts, which may occur following a minor injury to the meniscus and produce a small internal tear. As fluid begins to congregate within this tear, it is pushed deeper and deeper into the meniscus.

From the anatomic position, however, there are no primary internal rotators because no muscle is oriented even close to the horizontal plane. Several secondary internal rotators exist, however, including the anterior fibers of the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius, tensor fasciae latae, adductor longus, adductor brevis, and pectineus. The horizontal lines of force of many of these muscles are depicted in Fig. 12.35.57,129 The combined torque produced by the many secondary internal rotators adequately meets the typical functional demands placed on the hip. The anatomy of each of the internal rotators is described in other sections (see Figs. 12.26 and 12.43).”1 “Like all muscles of the lower extremity, the internal rotators have a unique function during locomotion. During the stance phase of gait, the internal rotators rotate the pelvis in the horizontal plane over a relatively fixed femur. These pelvic­ on­femoral kinematics are illustrated for the first 30% of the gait cycle in Fig. 12.36. The pelvic rotation about the right hip is shown by the forward rotation of the left iliac crest (seen from above). The right internal rotator muscles therefore can provide some of the drive to the contralateral (left) swinging limb, espe­ cially useful while walking uphill or increasing stride length. As described later in this chapter, the tensor fasciae latae and the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius are also functioning as hip abductors during this part of the gait cycle. Activation of these muscles is necessary to stabilize the pelvis in the frontal plane during this part of the gait cycle.”1 # Active Internal Rotation Torque Increases with Hip Flexion “With the hip approaching 90 degrees of flexion, the internal rota­ tion torque potential of the internal rotator muscles significantly increases.52,57,142,162 This becomes clear with the help of a skeleton model and a piece of string to mimic the line of force of a muscle, such as the anterior fibers of the gluteus minimus or the gluteus medius. Flexing the hip close to 90 degrees reorients the lines of force of these muscles from nearly parallel to nearly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of rotation of the femur. This occurs because the longitudinal axis of rotation remains parallel with the shaft of the repositioned femur. Delp and co­workers have reported that the internal rotation moment arm of the anterior fibers of the gluteus medius, for example, increases eightfold between 0 and 90 degrees of flexion (Fig. 12.37A).52 Even some of the external rotator muscles, such as the posterior fibers of the gluteus medius (depicted in Fig. 12.37B), piriformis, anterior (superior) fibers of the gluteus maximus, and posterior fibers of the gluteus minimus, switch actions and become internal rotators when the hip is flexed about 60 degrees and beyond.52,162 The biomechanical deviations of many of the rotator muscles that occur with increased hip flexion—including changes in magni­ tude and polarity of their moment arms—help partially explain why maximal­effort internal rotation torque in healthy persons is 35–55% greater with the hip flexed to about 90 degrees as com­ pared to when it is extended”1\n“The kinesiologic phenomenon just described helps partially explain the excessively internally rotated and flexed (“crouched”) gait pattern often observed in persons with cerebral palsy.93,225 With poor active control of hip extension (especially if combined with contracture of the hip flexor muscles), the flexed posture of the hip enhances the internal rotation torque potential of many muscles of the hip.11,12,52 Although speculation, the crouched gait (and associated increased tension in adductor and internal rotator muscles) may contribute to the persistence of excessive femoral anteversion in ambulatory persons with cerebral palsy. The crouched gait pattern may be better controlled by heightened activation or strength of the gluteus maximus, a potent extensor and external rotator.”1\n\n\nBiomechanics of the Adductor Muscles as Internal Rotators of the Hip\nIn general, most of the adductor muscles are capable of producing a modest internal rotation torque at the hip when the body is in or near the anatomic position.57,129,142,162 This action, however, may be difficult to reconcile considering that most adductors attach to the posterior side of the femur along the linea aspera. With normal anatomy of the hip, a shortening of these muscles would appear to rotate the femur externally instead of internally. What must be considered, however, is the effect that the natural anterior bowing of the femoral shaft has on the line of force of the muscles. Bowing places much of the linea aspera anterior to the longitudinal axis of rotation at the hip (Fig. 12.38A). As depicted in Fig. 12.38B, the horizontal force component of an adductor muscle, such as the adductor longus, lies anterior to the axis of rotation. Force from this muscle therefore acts with a moment arm to produce internal rotation.”1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Neumann DA, Kelly ER, Kiefer CL, Martens K, Grosz CM.

The distal, more tendinous, part of the muscle attaches to the greater trochanter (see Fig. 12.39), more specifically to its superior-posterior and lateral facets (see Fig. 12.6).101,194 The distal attachment to the laterally­projected greater trochanter provides the gluteus medius with excellent leverage to perform hip abduc­ tion (see Fig. 12.30). The gluteus medius is the largest of the hip abductor muscles, occupying about 60–65% of the primary abductor cross­sectional area.43,72 The broad and fan­shaped gluteus medius has been considered as having three functional sets of fibers: anterior, middle, and posterior.204 All fibers contribute to abduction of the hip; however, from the anatomic position, the anterior and posterior fibers are antagonists in their horizontal plane actions. Leverage for some of these actions may change considerably when muscle activation is initiated from well outside the anatomic position.”1\n“The gluteus minimus lies deep and slightly anterior to the gluteus medius (Fig. 12.43). The gluteus minimus attaches proxi­ mally on the ilium—between the anterior and inferior gluteal lines—and distally on anterior facet of the greater trochanter (see Fig. 12.6).72 The distal attachment also blends with the capsule of the hip joint.101,238 These muscular attachments may retract this part of the capsule away from the joint during motion—a mecha­ nism that may prevent capsular impingement.”1\n“The gluteus minimus is smaller than the gluteus medius, occupying about 20–30% of the cross­sectional area of the primary hip abductors.43,72 Although smaller than the gluteus medius, the gluteus minimus is equally respected for its role in stabilizing the hip in the stance phase of walking. All fibers of the gluteus minimus contribute to abduction. The more ante­ rior fibers also contribute to internal rotation and flexion, and the most posterior fibers contribute to external rotation.162 Fine­ wire EMG analysis of the gluteus minimus shows that the ante­ rior and posterior fibers are most active at slightly different times in the stance phase of walking, suggesting that they have differ­ ent roles in stabilizing the hip.”1\n“The tensor fascia latae is the smallest of the three primary hip abductors, occupying only about 4–10% of the primary abductor cross­sectional area.43,72 The anatomy of the tensor fasciae latae are discussed earlier in this chapter.”1\n“It is interesting to note that all the hip abductor muscles have an action as either internal or external rotators of the hip. The production of a pure frontal plane abduction torque therefore requires that the abductors completely neutralize one another’s horizontal plane torque potential.”1\n\n\n\nHip Abductor Mechanism: Control of Frontal Plane Stability of the Pelvis during Walking\n“The abduction torque produced by the hip abductor muscles is essential to the control of the frontal plane pelvic­on­femoral kinematics during walking. During most of the stance phase, the hip abductors stabilize the pelvis over the relatively fixed femur (see Fig. 12.36). During the stance phase, therefore, the hip abductor muscles have a role in controlling the pelvis in the frontal plane and, as discussed earlier, the horizontal plane.” “The abduction torque produced by the hip abductor muscles is particularly important during the single­limb–support phase of gait. During this phase the opposite leg is off the ground and swinging forward. Without adequate abduction torque on the stance limb, the pelvis and trunk may drop uncontrollably toward the side of the swinging limb. The activation of the hip abductor muscle can be easily appreciated by palpating the gluteus medius just superior to the greater trochanter. The right gluteus medius, for example, becomes firm as the left leg lifts off the ground.” “The frontal plane stabilizing function of hip abductor muscles is a very important component of walking. Furthermore, the force produced by the abductors during stance accounts for most of the compressive forces generated between the acetabulum and femoral head.”\n\n\nDominant Role in the Production of Compression Force at the Hip\n“Fig. 12.44 shows the major factors involved with maintaining frontal plane stability of the right hip during single­limb support, similar to that required during the midstance phase of walking. The forces created by active hip abductors and body weight create opposing torques that control the position and stability of the pelvis (within the frontal plane) over the femoral head. During single­limb support, the pelvis is comparable to a seesaw, with its fulcrum represented by the femoral head. When the seesaw is balanced, the counterclockwise (internal) torque produced by the right hip abductor force (HAF) equals the clockwise (external) torque caused by body weight (BW). This balance of opposing torques is called static rotary equilibrium.” “During single­limb support, the hip abductor muscles—in par­ ticular the gluteus medius—produce most of the vertical compres­ sion force across the hip.47 This important point is demonstrated by the model in Fig. 12.44.165,167 Note that the internal moment arm (D) used by the hip abductor muscles is about half the length of the external moment arm (D1) used by body weight.172 Given this length disparity, the hip abductor muscles must produce a force twice that of body weight in order to achieve stability during single­limb support. On every step, therefore, the acetabulum is pulled against the femoral head by the combined forces produced by the hip abductor muscles and the gravitational pull of body weight. To achieve static linear equilibrium, this downward force is counteracted by a joint reaction force (JRF) of equal magnitude but oriented in nearly the opposite direction (see Fig. 12.44). The joint reaction force is directed 10 to 15 degrees from vertical—an angle that is strongly influenced by the orientation of the hip abductor muscle force vector.” “The sample data supplied in Fig. 12.44 show how to estimate the approximate magnitude of the hip abductor force and hip joint reaction force. (For simplicity, all forces are assumed to act vertically, as shown in the seesaw model.) As shown in the calcula­ tions, an upward­directed joint reaction force (JRF) of 1873.8 N (421.3 lb) occurs when a person weighing 760.6 N (171 lb) is in single­limb support over the right limb. This reaction force is about 2.5 times body weight, 66% of which comes from the hip abductor muscles. During walking, the joint reaction force is even greater because of the acceleration of the pelvis over the femoral head. Data based on three­dimensional computer modeling or direct measurements from strain gauges implanted into a hip prosthesis show that joint compression forces reach three to almost four times body weight during walking.36,47,217 These forces can increase to at least five or six times body weight while running or ascending and descending stairs or ramps.196 Joint reaction forces increase with increasing walking speed or when associated with significant gait deviations” “Although the hip abductor muscles contribute significantly to compression force while in single­limb support, these and other muscles also contribute significantly to hip joint forces during nonambulatory activities. Actively lifting the lower limb with the knee extended from a supine position (i.e., the “straight­leg raise”) has been shown to generate hip joint reaction forces of about 1.4 times body weight, or about 50% of the joint force naturally produced while walking on a level surface.201 Furthermore, per­ forming a unilateral (supine) hip “bridging” exercise generates a hip joint reaction force of about three times body weight, similar to forces produced while walking. The magnitudes of these forces must be kept in mind when prescribing exercises for patients fol­ lowing hip surgery, such as a total hip arthroplasty or fracture repair.” “In most situations, the forces produced on the healthy hip by hip abductors or other muscles serve important physiologic func­ tions, such as stabilizing the femoral head within the acetabulum, assisting in the nutrition of the articular cartilage, and providing stimuli for normal development and shaping of joint structure in the growing child. The articular cartilage and trabecular bone normally protect the joint by safely dispersing large forces. A hip with arthritis, however, may no longer be able to provide this protection.”\n\n\nWeakness\n“Several medical conditions are associated with weakness of the hip abductor muscles. These may include muscular dystrophy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, incomplete spinal cord injury, greater trochanteric pain syndrome, hip arthritis or degeneration, poliomyelitis, low back pain, or undefined pathology. A person with a painful or unstable hip often experiences “disuse” weakness and atrophy in the abductor muscles—a consequence of purposely avoiding their strong muscular activation as a way to minimize the associated compression force across the joint.” neuman “The classic indicator of hip abductor weakness is the Trendelenburg sign.85 The patient is asked to stand in single-limb support over the suspected weak hip. The sign is positive if the pelvis drops to the side of the unsupported limb; in other words, the weak hip “falls” into pelvic-on-femoral adduction (see Fig. 12.22B). The clinician needs to be cautious, however, in interpreting and documenting the results of this test. The patient with a weak right hip abductor muscle, for example, may indeed drop the left side of the pelvis when asked to stand only on the right limb. The weakness may be masked, however, by a compensatory lean of the trunk to the right, especially if the weakness is marked. Leaning the trunk to the side of the weakness reduces the external torque demand on the abductor muscles by reducing the length of the external moment arm (see Fig. 12.44, D1). When observed while a person is walking, this compensatory lean to the side of weakness is referred to as a “gluteus medius limp” or “compensated Trendelenburg gait.” Using a cane in the hand opposite the weakened hip abductors can significantly improve this abnormal gait pattern” Neumann “For often unexplained reasons, weakness of the hip abductor muscles often persists longer than in other muscle groups following hip surgery or hip pathology. This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the gluteus medius and minimus are incised during surgery. The persistence of hip abductor weakness is similar to the often prolonged weakness of the quadriceps muscle at the knee following repair or injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (see Chapter 13). Neuman “Regardless of the cause, the functional and pathomechanical implications of prolonged hip abductor weakness can be widereaching, especially considering their important kinesiologic significance in upright, weight-bearing activities.232 Prolonged weakness of the hip abductor muscles has been associated with many impairments or conditions, including gait deviations, difficulty standing on one limb, postural instability, patellofemoral pain syndrome, low back pain, increased risk of ankle sprain, knee instability, and falling in the elderly” neuman “As a result of these and still other associations, significant EMG research has been devoted to discover which exercises most specifically target and thereby potentially strengthen the hip abductors, particularly the gluteus medius. Exercises that generate the most robust EMG response from the gluteus medius are assumed to reflect larger demands on this muscle. Research data clearly show that the higher “demand” exercises are those that specifically involve hip abduction (from femoral-on-pelvic or pelvic-on-femoral perspectives) performed with hip extension, internal or external rotation.180,202 These results are expected based on the primary or secondary actions of the various fibers of the gluteus medius listed in Table 12.3. Note, however, that Philippon and colleagues reported that a single-leg “bridging exercise” (with contralateral lower limb held in a “straight-leg raised” position) generated slightly higher EMG levels from the gluteus medius than any exercise involving side-lying hip abduction.180 The surprisingly high demands placed on the gluteus medius during the single-leg bridging exercise may provide insight into the muscular complexity of performing this seemingly simple, single plane action. Assume for the sake of discussion that the single-leg bridging exercise is powered by the right hip while the left lower extremity is held in a “straight-leg-raised” position. This exercise challenges the middle and posterior fibers of the right gluteus medius for extension support, while the middle fibers offset the strong adduction action of the right adductor magnus. Furthermore, the anterior fibers of the right gluteus medius are challenged to help offset both the external rotation potential of the right gluteus maximus as well as the external rotation (pelvic-onfemoral) gravitation torque placed on the right hip. Interestingly, this same EMG study reported far less gluteus medius activation during a bilateral bridging exercise. Dividing the hip extension torque across both hips reduces the demand on each individual gluteus medius to only 11% of maximum voluntary contraction (compared to 35% for a unilateral bridging exercise)” neuman\n\n\nDysfunction\nGreater trochanteric Pain syndrome (GTPS)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

As the extended and locked knee prepares to flex, the popliteus provides an important internal rotation torque that helps mechanically unlock the knee.7 (Recall that the knee is mechanically locked by a combination of extension and external rotation of the joint.) Unlocking the knee to flex into a squat position, for example, requires that the femur externally rotates slightly over a relatively fixed tibia. The ability of the popliteus to externally rotate the femur (and hence internally rotate the knee) is apparent by observing the muscle’s oblique line of force as it crosses behind the knee”2\n“The popliteus muscle’s oblique line of pull furnishes it with the most favorable leverage of all the knee flexor muscles for producing axial rotation on an extended knee. The line of force of the other knee flexor muscles is nearly vertical when the knee is extended, which greatly minimizes their axial rotation torque potential. Because of the popliteus muscle’s enhanced leverage to initiate internal rotation of the locked knee, it has been referred to as the key to the knee.”2\n“Another function of the popliteus is to help dynamically stabilize both the lateral and the medial sides of the knee. Along with other tissues within the posterior-lateral corner of the knee, the popliteus, by way of its strong intracapsular tendon, provides a significant resistance to a varus load applied to the knee. The popliteus also stabilizes the medial side of the knee by decelerating and limiting excessive external rotation of the knee. This action, performed through eccentric activation, may reduce the stress placed on the medial collateral ligament, posterior-medial capsule, and anterior cruciate ligament.”2\n“The popliteus has been long recognized as a general static stabilizer of the knee in a partial squat position. This proposed action, which has been advanced by studies using indwelling and surface EMG electrodes, may assist the posterior cruciate ligament in resisting a forward slide of the femur relative to the tibia when holding a partial-squat position.”2\n“The popliteus is a triangular muscle located deep to the gastrocnemius within the popliteal fossa (see Fig. 13.9). By a strong intracapsular tendon, the popliteus attaches proximally to the lateral condyle of the femur, between the lateral collateral ligament and the lateral meniscus (see Figs. 13.8 and 13.12). Just inferior to the knee joint, fibers from the tendon of the popliteus connect to the adjacent posterior edge of the lateral meniscus and to the head of the fibula (via the popliteofibular ligament; see Fig. 13.8).198 More distally, the popliteus has an extensive attachment to the posterior side of the tibia.”2\n“The popliteus originates from the lateral femoral condyle near the LCL. The muscle has several attachments, including the lateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle, the posteromedial aspect of the head of the fibula, and the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus.1 The larger base of this triangular muscle inserts obliquely into the posterosuperior part of the tibia above the soleal line. The muscle has several important functions, including the reinforcement of the posterior third of the lateral capsular ligament and the unlocking of the knee during flexion from terminal knee extension.1 It performs the latter task by internally rotating the tibia on the femur (a good example of an arcuvial muscle), preventing impingement of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus by drawing it posteriorly, and, with the PCL, preventing a posterior glide of the tibia. Since knee joint injury frequently involves some component of transverse-plane rotation and the popliteus muscle has been described as an important, primary, dynamic, transverse-plane, rotatory knee joint stabilizer, an understanding of its function in relation to other P-L knee joint structures is important.32 Attached to the popliteus tendon is the popliteofibular ligament, which forms a strong attachment to the popliteal tendon and the fibula. This ligament adds to P-L stability. A medial portion of the popliteus penetrates the joint, becoming intracapsular with the lateral meniscus. This part of the popliteus tendon is pain sensitive, and an injury here can often mimic a meniscal injury on the lateral aspect of the joint line. Differentiation between these two lesions can be elucidated with the reproduction of pain with resisted flexion in an extended and externally rotated position of the tibia if the popliteus is involved.”3\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Hip extension during walking recruits more hamstring activation and miniscule glute max3.\nIncreasing the activity intensity to running or jumping will cause a much greater Glute max recruitment3.\nLikewise, increase the amount of hip flexion required, such as running up a steep slope will also increase glute max recruitment3.\n\n\nBiomechanics\nThe moment arm of the gluteus maximus decreases as the hip moves into flexion1.

The Glute med is efficient since it is almost perpendicular to its lever arm3.\nThe glute med and glute min are both oriented mostly in the frontal plane, but the glute med is a greater abductor since it can produce ~16kg of force, which is more than 3x that of the gluteus minimus3.\nThe glute med’s insertional angle on the greater trochanter varies with degree of hip abduction3. At neutral, the angle is not perpendicular, thus the force generate by the glute med results in a hip abduction moment and joint compression which increases articular contact3.\nAs the hip moves into abduction, the insertional angle becomes more perpendicular, resulting in a greater hip abduction moment and decreased hip joint approximation force3.

From there, it travels distally, becoming cord-like about two-thirds of the way down the posteromedial thigh. Passing over the MCL, it inserts into the medial surface of the tibia and deep fascia of the lower leg, distal to the gracilis attachment, and posterior to the sartorius attachment. These three structures are collectively called the pes anserinus (“goose foot”) at this point. Like the semimembranosus, the semitendinosus functions to extend the hip, flex the knee, and internally rotate the tibia.”2\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The relatively small (and often poorly defined) set of horizontally directed fibers crosses from the inferior pubic ramus to the extreme proximal end of the linea aspera, often called the adductor minimus. The larger obliquely directed fibers run from the ischial ramus to nearly the entire length of the linea aspera, as far distally as the medial supracondylar line.”3\n“The posterior head of the adductor magnus consists of a thick mass of the fibers arising from the region of the pelvis adjacent to the ischial tuberosity. From this posterior attachment, the fibers run vertically and attach as a tendon on the adductor tubercle on the medial side of the distal femur. The posterior head of the adductor magnus is innervated by the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve, as are most of the hamstring muscles. Because location, innervation, and action are similar to those of the hamstring muscles, the posterior head may also be referred to as the extensor head of the adductor magnus”3\n\n\nOverview\n“the adductor magnus is the largest of the adductor muscles, accounting for 60% of the total cross ­sectional area of the entire adductor muscle group.222 As a whole, the adductor magnus attaches proximally to the pelvis from two heads: an anterior head from the ischial ramus and a posterior head from the ischial tuberosity.

As a result, these two joints can impact the rectus femoris’ efficiency on the other. The hip joint can significantly impact the rectus femoris’ role in the knee extensor mechanism3. In addition, the rectus femoris’ ability to efficiently flex the knee is proportional to the degree of hip flexion2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n“The line of pull of the rectus femoris, with respect to the patella, is at an angle of about 5 degrees with the femoral shaft (see Fig. 20-12).”3\n\n\n\n\nForce Couple\nErector Spinae and the Rectus Femoris are considered a force couple since both produce anterior pelvic tilt\n\n\nNotes\n“The rectus femoris attaches to the pelvis near the anterior-inferior iliac spine and immediately superior to the acetabulum. The vastus muscles, however, attach to an extensive part of the femur, particularly the anterior-lateral shaft and the linea aspera (see Fig. 12.5). Although the vastus lateralis has the largest cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscles, the vastus medialis extends farther distally toward the knee.”4\n“The proximal part of the rectus femoris emerges between the limbs of an inverted V formed by the sartorius and tensor fasciae latae (see Fig. 12.26). This large bipennate­shaped muscle has its proximal attachments on the anterior­inferior iliac spine, along the superior rim of the acetabulum, and in the adjacent joint capsule. The relatively robust capsular attachment made by the “reflected” tendon of the rectus femoris has been described as an important stabilizer of the anterior capsule.238 Along with the other members of the quadriceps, the rectus femoris attaches to the tibia via the patellar tendon. The rectus femoris is responsible for about one­third of the total isometric flexion torque at the hip.144 In addition, the rectus femoris is a primary knee extensor. The combined two­joint actions of this important muscle are considered in Chapter 13. The anatomy and function of the pectineus and adductor longus are described in the section on the adductors of the hip.”4\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "External Torque Demands Placed against the Quadriceps: Contrasting “Tibial-on-Femoral” with “Femoral-on-Tibial” Methods of Knee Extension\n“Many strengthening exercises designed to challenge the quadriceps muscle rely on resistive, external torques generated only by gravity acting on the body. The magnitude of the external torque is highly dependent on the specific manner in which the knee is being extended. These differences are illustrated in Fig. 13.25. During tibial-on-femoral knee extension, the external moment arm of the weight of the lower leg increases from 90 to 0 degrees of knee flexion (see Fig. 13.25A–C). In contrast, during femoralon-tibial knee extension (as in rising from a squat position), the external moment arm of the upper body weight decreases from 90 to 0 degrees of knee flexion (see Fig. 13.25D–F). The graph included in Fig. 13.25 contrasts the external torque–knee angle relationships for the two methods of extending the knee between 90 degrees of flexion and full extension”3\n“Information contained in the graph in Fig. 13.25 is useful for designing quadriceps strengthening exercises. By necessity, exercises that significantly challenge the quadriceps also stress the knee joint, patellofemoral joint, and periarticular connective tissues, such as the ACL. Clinically, this stress may be considered potentially damaging or therapeutic, depending on the underlying, if any, pathology of the person performing the exercise. A person with marked patellofemoral joint pain or painful knee arthritis, for example, is typically advised against producing large muscularbased stresses on the knee. A completely healthy person or a high-level athlete in the later phases of postsurgical ACL rehabilitation, in contrast, may actually benefit from such judiciously applied muscular stresses to the knee.”3\n“External torques applied to the knee by a constant load vary in a predictable fashion, based on knee angle and orientation of the limb segments. As depicted by the red shading in the graph in Fig. 13.25, external torques are relatively large from 90 to 45 degrees of flexion via femoral-on-tibial extension, and from 45 to 0 degrees of flexion via tibial-on-femoral extension. Reducing these external torques can be accomplished by several strategies. An external load, for example, can be applied at the ankle during ibial-on-femoral knee extension specifically between 90 and 45 degrees of flexion. This activity can be followed by an exercise that involves rising from a partial squat position, a motion that incorporates femoral-on-tibial extension between 45 and 0 degrees of flexion. Combining both exercises in the manner described provides only moderate to minimal external torques against the quadriceps, throughout a continuous range of motion. This strategy of applying external torque has been considered appropriate when attempting to strengthen the quadriceps yet minimize the stress on the underlying patellofemoral joint.261”3"

    "text": "Internal Torque–Joint Angle Relationship of the Quadriceps Muscle\n“Maximal knee extension (internal) torque typically occurs between 45 and 70 degrees of knee flexion, with less torque produced at the near extremes of flexion and extension.115,169,171,254,268 The shape of this torque-angle curve varies, however, based on the type and speed of activation and position of the hip. A representative maximal-effort torque versus joint angle curve obtained from healthy male subjects is displayed in Fig. 13.26. In this study, subjects produced maximal-effort (isometric) knee extension torque with hips held fixed in extension.297 As depicted by the red line in Fig. 13.26, maximal-effort knee extension torque remains at least 90% of maximum between 80 and 30 degrees of flexion. This high-torque potential of the quadriceps within this arc of motion is used during many functional activities that incorporate femoral-on-tibial kinematics, such as ascending a high step, rising from a chair, or holding a partial squat position while participating in sports, such as basketball or speed skating. Note the rapid decline in internal torque potential as the knee angle approaches full extension. Most studies report a 50% to 70% reduction in maximal internal torque as the knee approaches full extension.92,171,254 Of interest, the external torque applied against the knee during femoral-on-tibial extension also declines rapidly during this same range of motion (see Fig. 13.25, graph). There appears to be a general biomechanical match in the internal torque potential of the quadriceps and the external torques applied against the quadriceps during the last approximately 45 to 70 degrees of complete femoral-on-tibial knee extension. This match accounts, in part, for the popularity of “closed-kinematic chain” exercises that focus on applying resistance to the quadriceps while the upright person moves the body through this arc of femoralon-tibial knee extension.”3"

The superficial surface of the muscle is covered by and partially adhered to a relatively thick sheet of fascia, which limits the ease of palpating the belly of the muscle. From its cranial attachment, the temporalis forms a broad tendon that narrows distally as it passes through a space formed between the zygomatic arch and the lateral side of the skull (see Fig. 11.5). The muscle attaches distally to the coronoid process and to the anterior edge and medial surface of the ramus of the mandible (see Fig. 11.2). Bilateral contractions of the temporalis muscles elevate the mandible, producing a very effective biting force.91 The more oblique posterior fibers elevate and retrude the mandible. Similar to the masseter, the temporalis courses slightly medially as its approaches its distal attachment. Unilateral contraction of the temporalis, therefore, as when chewing in a side-to-side manner, causes slight ipsilateral excursion of the mandible (see Fig. 11.18). As explained for the masseter, the effectiveness of the temporalis for producing ipsilateral excursion is enhanced when the muscle is activated from a position of contralateral excursiona natural, cyclic kinematic pattern used while chewing.”2\n\n\n\n\nPalpation\nTemporalis is a thin sheet so use light pressure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Significance\n\n1.

The considerably larger inferior head arises from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and adjoining region of the maxilla. As a whole, the lateral pterygoid muscle traverses nearly horizontally to insert into a region of the neck of the mandible, very near the joint (review Fig. 11.10).4,27,28,77,99 Although the specific anatomic details are debated,14 the superior head of the lateral pterygoid shares attachments with the pterygoid fossa (see Fig. 11.2), the medial wall of the capsule, and the medial side of the”2\n\n\n\n\nPalpation\n\nIntraoral: debatable (Turp 2001)\n\nposterior up towards the mandibular neck\ncranial directed pressure underneath zygomatic arch (have subject protrude)\nAsk them to protrude w/ palpation\n\n\n\n\nClinical Significance\nPractically functions to stabilize the articular disc of the TMJ\nTears or excessive elongation of the lateral ligament may cause the disc to migrate medially by an unopposed pull of the superior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle2\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This seeming contradiction is explained here.\nIn the sagittal plane, the bilateral SCM contraction results in head and upper cervical extension and mid-lower cervical flexion, but its actions have much more nuance and complexity. When in upright, the SCM work bilaterally to bring the head forward and assist the longus colli to flex the mid-lower cervical spine1. When in supine, the SCM muscles contract bilaterally to lift the flex the head against gravity1. When gazing upwards, the SCM muscles function eccentrically and isometrically to control hyperextension of the neck1.\nWhen the head is fixed, the SCM muscles function as accessory muscles of respiration2,3 to assist in thorax elevation during forced inspiration1.\nThe SCM also functions to control translation of the head. The SCM also minimizes trauma by resisting forceful posterior translation of the head, including car accidents involving collision from the rear1. Both SCM are coactivated with mandibular movements and work to prevent/control posterior translation of the head during mastication2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe coactivation of the SCM during chewing and swallowing may play a role in spatial orientation, weight perception, and motor coordination1"

The ligamentum flavum is made up of 80% elastin and only 20% collagen1. This provides the ligamentum flavum with highly elastic properties1.\n\n\nFunction\nSince the ligamentum flavum is 80% elastin it results in an elastic tissue that excels at exerting a constant force at a moderate resistance1. The ligamentum flavum is taut in end-range spinal flexion where it functions to absorb some of the intervertebral compression1.\nThe ligamentum flavum increases in strain by ~35% from neutral spine to full flexion1.\n\n\nDysfunction\nExtreme spinal flexion past full ROM can lead to a ligamentum flavum rupture1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis position will not only place excess strain on the ligamentum flavum but also place high amounts of compression on the anterior aspect of the intervertebral disc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

It provides the primary restraint to varus and lateral rotation of the tibia and is a secondary restraint to the anterior and posterior translation of the tibia on the femur.”1\n\nAnatomy\n“The LCL, or fibular collateral ligament (see Fig. 20-1), arises from the lateral femoral condyle and runs distally and posteriorly to insert into the head of the fibula. The LCL forms part of the socalled arcuate–ligamentous complex. This complex also comprises the biceps femoris tendon, iliotibial tract, and the popliteus.”1\n“The cord-like LCL develops independently and remains completely free from the joint capsule and the lateral meniscus. It is separated from these structures by the popliteus tendon and straddled by the split tendon of the biceps femoris.”1\nThe LCL can be divided into three parts:\n\nAnterior. This part consists of the joint capsule.\nMiddle. This part is considered to be part of the iliotibial band (ITB) and covers the capsular ligament.\nPosterior. This Y-shaped portion of the ligament is part of the arcuate–ligamentous complex, which supports the posterior capsule.\n\n\n\nFunction\n“The main function of the LCL is to resist varus forces. It offers the majority of the varus restraint at 25 degrees of knee flexion and in full extension.14 Abnormal varus laxity arising subsequent to injuries of the LCL and other P-L structures has been shown to increase stress on cruciate ligament grafts and has been implicated as one of the causes of crucial ligament reconstruction failure.21”1\n\n“The MCL complex acts as the primary restraint to valgus rotation of the tibia, providing as much as 80% of the restraining force to valgus loads.21”1\n“The LCL provides the primary restraint to varus rotation of the knee, acts as a secondary restraint to external rotation and posterior displacement of the tibia21 and, during normal gait, is the primary passive structure resisting the knee adduction (varus) moment.21”1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Secondary Restraints\n“Some structures in the knee, known as secondary restraints, augment the functions of the ACL and the PCL. These secondary restraints include the structures in the P-L and posteromedial corners of the knee, which serve to control anterior tibial translation relative to the femur.14”1\n“Dynamic stability synergistic to the PCL is provided by unopposed contraction of the quadriceps complex, which increases anterior tibial translation. Conversely, an isolated contraction of the hamstrings results in a posterior translation of the tibia, which is synergistic to the ACL. Cocontraction of the hamstrings and the quadriceps has been theorized to minimize tibial translation in either direction. The popliteus muscle–tendon complex (PMTC) contributes to both static and dynamic P-L knee joint stabilization. During concentric activation, the popliteus internally rotates the tibia on the femur. During eccentric activation, it serves as a secondary restraint to tibial external rotation on the femur (see “Popliteus” section).22”1\n“The knee joint is also strengthened externally by the patellar ligament, oblique popliteal ligaments, and the fabella.”\n\n“The patellar ligament, or patellar tendon, lies in the thickened portion of the quadriceps femoris tendon between the top of the patella and the tibia (Fig. 20-1). The patellar ligament strengthens the anterior portion of the knee joint and prevents the lower leg from being flexed excessively.”1\n“The oblique popliteal ligament, located on the posterior surface of the knee joint, is a dense thickening in the posterior capsule made up of a continuation of the popliteal tendon and part of the insertion of the semimembranosus.1 It arises posterior to the medial condyle of the tibia and extends superomedially to attach to the posterior fibrous capsule. The oblique popliteal ligament provides reinforcement to the lateral capsule, limits A-M rotation of the tibia, and prevents hyperextension of the knee.”1\n“The fabella is located in the P-L corner of the knee and may be osseous or cartilaginous in makeup. When the fabella is present, there is a fabellofibular ligament, which courses superiorly and obliquely from the lateral head of the gastrocnemius to the fibular styloid. The fabellofibular ligament helps prevent excessive internal rotation of the tibia and adds further ligamentous support on the lateral and P-L aspects of the knee.1”1"

The distal surface articulates with the bases of both the fourth and the fifth metatarsals. The cuboid is therefore homologous to the hamate bone in the wrist.”1\n“The entire, curved proximal surface of the cuboid articulates with the calcaneus (see Fig. 14.4). The medial surface has an oval facet for articulation with the lateral cuneiform and a small facet for articulation with the navicular. A distinct groove runs across the plantar surface of the cuboid, which in life is occupied by the tendon of the fibularis longus muscle (see Fig. 14.5).”1\n\n\n\nThe cuboid is supported by the fibularis longus as its tendon passes around the lateral and inferior aspect of the cuboid as it runs towards its insertion on the medial cuneiform and base of 1st metatarsal.\n\nMuscular attachments\n\n\n\nTable 1: Muscular insertions on the cuboid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle\nOrigin\nInsertion\nInnervation\nAction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Muscles originating from the cuboid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle\nOrigin\nInsertion\nInnervation\nAction\n\n\n\n\nAbductor digiti minimi\nMedial tubercle of calcaneal tuberosity\nCuboid\nLateral cuneiforms\n3-5th MTP joints\nDeep transverse metatarsal lig.\nBase of 5th proximal phalanx\nBase of 1st proximal phalanx (via common tendon)\nLateral Plantar n.\nLateral Plantar n.

The most common cause of long thoracic nerve injury results from carrying a heavy object on the shoulder. Other causes include postinfection, postinjection, postpartum, and postoperative origins.16 Similar to other peripheral nerve injuries, trauma to the nerve can be caused by a direct blow or a traction force to the nerve.”1\n“The traction injury can occur when concurrent head rotation away, side bending away, and neck flexion are coupled with the arm positioned overhead. Other mechanisms that have been attributed to long thoracic nerve dysfunction include lifting weights overhead, driving a golf ball, and serving a tennis ball.16”:1\n\n\nClinical Presentation\nLong Thoracic Nerve dysfunction generally presents as:\n\n“Vague pain in the neck and the scapula region”1.\n“An inability to fully elevate the arm overhead”1.\n“Shoulder flexion and abduction are weak and limited in active range of motion (AROM) due to the loss of the trapezius–serratus anterior force couple”\n\n(see Chapter 16 of Dutton1).\n\nScapular winging\n\n\n\nIntervention\nConservative intervention includes:\n\nProtection of the serratus anterior with a brace or restraint1\nMuscle taping1\nStrengthening exercises for the rhomboids, pectoralis, trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

It descends vertically through this space, passing between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle to the posterior aspect of the leg, and to the posteromedial aspect of the ankle, where its terminal branches serve the foot and ankle (see Chapter 21).”2\n“The tibial nerve supplies the gastrocnemius, plantaris, soleus, popliteus, tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus muscles. Articular branches pass to the knee and ankle joints.”2\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Gilroy AM, MacPherson BR, Wikenheiser JC, Voll MM, Wesker K, Schünke M, eds. Atlas of Anatomy. 4th ed.

    "section": "Why LA is considered essential",
    "text": "Why LA is considered essential\nLinoleic acid was first considered to be an essential fatty acid (EFA) based on animal studies by Burr and Burr in 1929–1930 where the researchers found that rats who received 0.6% of total dietary calories as linoleic acid had 30% higher bodyweight, did not develop skin desquamation, or tail necrosis compared to total-fat-deficient- rats1. With these results, a dietary requirment of 1% and then 2% of the total daily caloric intake should be linoleic acid was established1. This idea was believed to be further supported by two studies where human infants intaking linoleic acid abolished the physiological symptoms of omega-6 deficiency1."

    "text": "Counterargument\nUpon review of these articles supporting the “essential” nature of linoleic acid, these studies have multiple drawbacks.\n\nThe conclusion established using the controlled diets were experiencing a “dual deficiency” in omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nsee2\n\n\n\nDual Deficiency\nSubsequent studies in rat models similar to those used to originally classify LA as an essential fatty acid have demonstrated that the dietary omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is able to diminish the symptoms of LA deficiency [22].\nThis strongly suggests that the absence of ALA in the original studies probably heightened the significance of the physiological symptoms caused by LA deficiency. It seems that, at least for the rat model, the nutritional requirement for LA has probably been seriously overestimated.\nA more precise estimation of the LA requirement is likely closer to a 75% reduction, or 0.5%, of the dietary energy rather than 2% [23].\nThis calls into question how “essential” LA really is in the human diet since we cannot determine what symptoms were due to deficiency of omega-6 or omega-3. This likely overestimates the LA requirement in humans. To make this worse, the Institute of Medicine (IoM) arbitrarily decided to further overestimate the recommended intake, creating an upper limit of 10%1. Even then, the USDA reports that most American adults are consuming above the IoM limit of 10%1."

Fatty acids are highly reduced (low oxygen-to-hydrogen ratio) allowing them to store large amounts of potential chemical energy1. Triacylglycerols do not need hydration due to their water-insolubility, making these “low maintenance” and efficient1. Storage of hydrophobic fats as triacylglycerols is also highly efficient because water is not needed to hydrate the stored fats.\nMembrane lipids consist of hydrophobic tails attached to polar head groups1.

    "text": "Also known as triglycerides or neutral fats1.\n\nStructure\nTriacylglycerols are composed of 3 fatty acids, each in ester linkage. An ester linkage is a chemical bond between an acid and an alcohol. In triacylglycerols, the ester linkage consists of an acid (fatty acid) and it is chemically bound to an alcohol (glycerol)1.\n\n\nFunction\nTriacylglycerols are nonpolar and hydrophobic molecules since the polar hydroxyls of glycerol and the polar carboxylates of the fatty acids are bound in ester linkages1. Due to their nonpolar and hydrophobic state, triacylglycerols are essentially insoluble in water, which is crucial for their role in energy storage.\n\n\nSimple & Complex\nTriaglyceroles consisting of a single type of fatty acid in all 3 positions is called “simple triacylglycerols” and are named after the fatty acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nPalmitic acid (16:0) simple triacylglycerol → Tripalmitin\nStearic acid (18:0) simple triacylglycerol → Tristearin\nOleic acid (18:1) simple triacylglycerol → Triolein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMost naturally occurring triacylglycerols are mixed1\n\n\nTo name non-simple triacylglycerols without ambiguity, the name and position of each fatty acid must be specified1.\n\n\nRole in Energy Storage\nIn vertebrates, triacylglycerols are stored in specialized cells called “adipocytes”, or “fat cells”1. These adipocytes store large amounts of triacylglycerols as fat droplets that nearly fill the cell1.\n\n\nVersus polysaccharides\nTriacylglycerols have 2 significant advantages that make it better for energy storage than polysaccharides (starch or glycogen)1.\n\nFatty acid carbon atoms are more reduced and therefore yield more (&gt;2x) energy\nTriacylglycerols are hydrophobic and do not need to be hydrated1. Oppositely, polysaccharides need to be hydrated and thus require the organism to carry extra water to maintain polysaccharide hydration1.\n\nTriacylglycerols can hold much more energy (weeks to months) than glycogen1. Glycogen has its benefits since it can produce metabolic energy quicker due to their water solubility1.\n\n\nSerum\nBlood test for serum triglycerides\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Then the results are measured using dependent variables\nAn odds ratio compares two groups of people who only differ based on exposure. You could think of exposure as the “independent variable.” When viewing the results, you could view the exposure rates as the “dependent variables.” Thus when comparing the two using an odds ratio, you are trying to ascertain whether the exposure was statistically significant in outcome rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical use:\n\nOdds ratios commonly are used to report case-control studies\n\n\n\nCalculation\n\nThe odds ratio (OR) is a measure of how strongly an event is associated with exposure.\nOR = odds that a case was exposed / Odds that a control was exposed\nThe odds ratio is a ratio of two sets of odds: the odds of the event occurring in an exposed group versus the odds of the event occurring in a non-exposed group\n\n\n\n\n\nDisease (Case)\nNo Disease (Control)\n\n\n\n\nExposed\nA\nB\n\n\nUnexposed\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nTo interpret the OR, you need to first determine what part of the test is considered the “exposure” and what part of the test is the “outcome.”\n\n\n\nOR Value\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n&lt;1\nOdds of disease lower with exposed than non-exposed\n\n\n1\nNo difference in odds of disease\n\n\n&gt;1\nOdds of disease greater in exposed than non-exposed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nAn odds ratio of 0.98 indicates that the group who were exposed to the variable were 2% less likely to have the outcome.\nAn odds ratio of 1.02 indicates that the group who was exposed to the variable were 2% more likely to have the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n2x2 Contingency Table1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExposure\nPresent\nAbsent\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nPresent\nA  (90)\nB  (210)\nA + B  (300)\n\n\nAbsent\nC  (350)\nD  (350)\nC + D  (700)\n\n\nTotal\nA + C  (440)\nB + D  (760)\nA + B + C + D  (1000)\n\n\n\nHow to calculate the Odds Ratio for the contingency table: \\[\n\\begin{align*} \\textrm{Relative Risk} &=\\frac{\\frac{A}{(C)}}{\\frac{B}{(D)}}\n\\\\ &=\\frac{90}{350}/\\frac{210}{350}\n\\\\ &=\\frac{0.26}{0.6}\n\\\\ &= 0.43\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nBased on the results of the odds ratio calculation (0.43) we can conclude:\n\nThe exposed group has 0.43 times the odds of of exposure to the outcome compared to the control group1.\nThe case group is 57% less likely to have the exposure compared to the control group1\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Single studies are liable to be unrepresentative of the total evidence and be misleading.8 Collecting and appraising multiple studies require time and expertise that practitioners may not have. Systematic reviews include a greater range of patients than any single study, potentially enhancing confidence in applying the results to the patient at hand.”1\n“Meta-analysis of a body of evidence includes a larger sample size and more events than any individual study, leading to greater precision of estimates, facilitating confident decision making. Metaanalysis also provides an opportunity to explore reasons for inconsistency among studies.”1\n“A key limitation of systematic reviews and meta-analyses is that they produce estimates that are as reliable as the studies summarized. A pooled estimate derived from meta-analysis of randomized trials at low risk of bias will always be more reliable than that derived from a meta-analysis of observational studies or of randomized trials with less protection against bias.”1"

Clinicians will be uncomfortable with a meta-analysis of the first question and likely of the second. Combining the results of these studies would yield an estimate of effect that would make little sense or be misleading. Comfort level in combining studies increases in the third and fourth questions, although clinicians may even express concerns about the fourth question because it combines symptomatic and asymptomatic populations.”1\n“What makes a meta-analysis too broad or too narrow? Clinicians need to decide whether, across the range of patients, interventions or exposures, and outcomes, it is plausible that the intervention will have a similar effect. This decision will reflect an understanding of the underlying biology and may differ between individuals; it will only be possible, however, when systematic reviewers explicitly present their eligibility criteria.”1\n\n\nWas the Search for Relevant Studies Exhaustive?\n“Systematic reviews are at risk of presenting misleading results if they fail to secure a complete or representative sample of the available eligible studies. For most clinical questions, searching a single database is insufficient. Searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials may be a minimal requirement for most clinical questions6 but for many questions will not uncover all eligible articles. For instance, one study demonstrated that searching MEDLINE and EMBASE separately retrieved, respectively, only 55% and 49% of the eligible trials.9 Another study found that 42% of published meta-analyses included at least 1 trial not indexed in MEDLINE.10 Multiple synonyms and search terms to describe each concept are needed.”1"

Regression of the mean can usually cause an underestimation of treatment effects due to greater potential for improvement in extreme scores in the control group. Regression toward the mean states that if a score deviates from the mean on one occasion, then a subsequent measurement will be closer to the average1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nPatients in control group have significantly higher pain scores at baseline compared to patients in experimental group Example of Selection & Regression of the mean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nA study chooses participants whether they are above or below a cut-off score1.\nDue to measurement error\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\nAccording to measurement theory, the observed score (\\(X_o\\)) is the sum of the “True score” (\\(X_T\\)) and some error (\\(e\\)). Measurement error (\\(e\\)) of the instrument may cause some individuals to erroneously be considered outside of the cut-off point and individuals who truly fit the criteria and excluded. Simultaneously, (\\(e\\)) can cause individuals who do not truly meet the criteria to be erroneously scored an extreme score far from their mean and therefore included in the participants.

For example, consider a study that is testing the effects of a new type of psychotherapy. Suppose that the researcher is a therapist evaluating the mental health of the participants. In this case, it is quite possible that the therapist’s desire to see the study work creates an unconscious predisposition to see participants in the experimental group as having improved more. Even if an independent observer rates the two groups but knows who is in which group, a desire for the experiment to come out a particular way may unintentionally influence the observer’s evaluations.”1\n“The preferred solution to this problem is called blind conditions of testing. This means that the experimenter, at the time of interacting with the participant, is not aware of whether the participant is in the experimental or control group. (We already considered above what is called double-blind testing, where neither researcher nor participant knows what condition they are in. There we were emphasizing the importance of the participant not being aware of who was in what condition; here we are emphasizing the importance of the experimenter not knowing who is in which condition at the time of testing.)”1\n\n\nExperimenter Bias\nExperimenter bias can occur if the investigator is not blinded to which group the patient is in, which creates a higher chance that they may consciously or unconsciously influence the patient response during testing.\nExperimenter bias can occur for tests involving:\n\nParticularly concerning for outcome measure that involve\nSubjective judgments by the examiner\nUnstandardized physical performance tests where the investigator can provide more/less instruction or encouragement to change performance\nSurveys given to patients with someone with whom they’ve developed a relationship during treatment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSame examiner who provided experimental and control treatments also assesses ROM before and after intervention could consciously or subconsciously provide more overpressure.\n\n\n\n\nPrevention\nBlinding: In general more people who are blinded, the more confident you can be in the results\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Exploratory factor analysis, by contrast, is largely a tool for exploring the dimensionality of a set of items, and for identifying items to revise or eliminate. In the sample of nursing articles, factor analysis was undertaken in 85 studies (81.0%), and exploratory factor analysis was used exclusively in 51 of these (60.0%).

In the sample of 105 nursing studies, a full 36 (34.3%) of them involved efforts to assess the cross-cultural validity of a translated scale.”\n“In summary, nurse researchers could strengthen their validity claims in instrument studies by testing thoughtful, theory-based hypotheses about the extent to which the measure yields scores that ‘‘behave’’ as predicted in relation to other constructs—or by identifying an appropriate gold standard for a criterion validation. Factor analysis alone as a construct validity strategy does not directly answer the central validity question: Does the scale measure the construct it purports to measure?

    "text": "Reliability relates to the extent of variability and error inherent in a measurement and can be interpreted as the extent to which measurements can be replicated1. Reliability reflects not only degree of correlation but also agreement between measurements1.\nReliability is NOT the same as validity\n“in order to improve reliability, attempts must be made to remove random error”2\n\nSignificance of Reliability\n\nOne cannot be confident in the results of a scale with poor reliability3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Poor reliability\n\n\n\n\nIf a person’s score is 10 on 1 occasion and 15 on another (again assuming the person has not changed)3\nIf 1 rater gives a score of 7 and another a score of 12, we wouldn’t be sure which, if either, score is correct3.\nSimilarly, if the items of a scale are not related to each other, we would not be sure just what it is that the scale is measuring (assuming that the scale is measuring a homogeneous construct)3.\n\n\n\n\n\nMisconceptions\nReliability is sometimes used synonymously with ‘precision,’‘agreement,’ and ‘repeatability,’ but these are misslabeling the concept3.\n\n\nNon-mathematical explanation\nReliability is made up of 2 parts: Correlation and Agreement. :::{layout-ncol=“2”} ### Correlation\n\nCorrelation refers to the fact that there is a pattern between results.\nFor example, results iwth high correlation would mean that Test 2 is always greater than test 1.\n\nOr Test 2 is always slightly smaller than test 1.\n\n\n\nAgreement\n\nAgreement quantifies the magnitude of difference from Test 1 and Test 2.\nIt does not indicate whether the results follow a similar pattern, but how much they differ from eachother.\n\n:::\n\n\n\nCalculation\nReliability is the proportion of the total variance (\\(\\sigma_Total^2\\)) in scores that is due to differences among people3.\n\\[\nReliability = \\frac{\\sigma_s^2}{\\sigma_s^2 + \\sigma_e^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_s^2}{\\sigma_Total^2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma_s^2\\)\nSubject variability3,4\n\n\n\\(\\sigma_e^2\\)\nMeasurement error3,4\n\n\n\\(\\sigma_Total^2\\)\nTotal variance3,4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nTerms such as ‘precision,’‘agreement,’ and ‘repeatability’ focus solely on the fact that the error term should be as small as possible3.\nThese terms ignore the fact that reliability also depends on the variability among people3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject variability implications\n\n\n\n\nIf there is no variability between participants ( \\(\\sigma_s^2\\) ) then \\(\\sigma_s^2 = 0\\) the reliability is 03.\n\nThe reliability of a scale reflects its ability to differentiate among people and if it cannot, then the reliability is 0 and the scale is useless3.\n\nAnother implication about \\(\\sigma_s^2\\) is that reliability is not a fixed property, but rather dependent on the sample being studied.\n\nReliability is is very dependent on the sample in which it is determined3.\nExample: Applying a depression scale to ER patients vs outpatient psychiatric patients\n\nThe ER Patients would consist of people who have very low depression to extremely high depression (suicidally depressed)3.\n\nThis sample has a very high patient variability ( \\(\\sigma_s^2\\) ) and thus a higher reliability score3\n\nThe outpatient psychiatric patients would likely have moderate levels of depression (those with high depression would be administered to a hospital)3.\n\nThus there will be low patient variability (\\(\\sigma_s^2\\)) and the reliability will be lower3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Reliability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInter-rater Reliability\n\nInter-rater reliability (IRR): Consistency of a measure assessed by multiple raters\n\n\n\nInter-rater Agreement\nInter-rater agreement (IRA) measures the variation in results of a test when performed by different assessors on the same patient at the same time point.\n\n\nIntra-rater Reliability\nIntra-rater reliability measures the variation of results of an assessor across multiple time points.\n\n\n\n\nTest-Retest Reliability\nTest-Retest Reliability measures the reliability of the instrument across multiple time points.\n\n\nInternal Consistency\n\nInternal Consistency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliability Coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutdated measures of reliability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, Pearson correlation coefficient, paired t test, and Bland-Altman plot have been used to evaluate reliability1.\nThese tests only measure correlation and disregard variance, thus are are nonideal measures of reliability1.\n\n\n\n\nCommon reliability statistics include:\n\nPercent agreement\nKappa Coefficient\nKrippenndorff’s Alpha\nCronbach’s Alpha\nCorrelation Coefficient\nIntra-Class Correlation Coefficient\n\n\n\nScoring\nValues range from 0.00 (not reliable) to 1.00 (perfectly reliable)\n\n“Rule of thumb” Quick interpretation of

confidence interval defines a range in which the true coefficient lies with a given probability5\nFor a result to show that reliability is better than chance at a confidence level of 95%, the lower limit of the CI must be above 0.65.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow High Should Reliability be?\n\n\n\nHow high should reliability be?\n\nScales used in new, underdeveloped research areas should have a minimum reliability of 0.703.\nScales coming from mature areas of research, the minimum is 0.803.\nand if the scale is to be used for clinical purposes the minimum is 0.903.\n\n\n\n*Poor-moderate reliability are not good for clinical decision making since you are likely to get a different result everytime you test your patient, regardless of

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Bonferroni correction The simplest approach to achieving a familywise error rate is to divide the value of α (often 5%) by the number of comparisons. Then define a particular comparison as statistically significant only when its P value is less than that ratio. This is called a Bonferroni correction1.\nImagine that an experiment makes 20 comparisons. If all 20 null hypotheses are true and there are no corrections for multiple comparisons, about 5% of these comparisons are expected to be statistically significant (using the usual definition of α). Table 22.1 and Figure 22.1 show that there is about a 65% chance of obtaining one (or more) statistically significant result.1\nIf the Bonferroni correction is used, a result is only declared to be statistically significant when its P value is less than 0.05/20, or 0.0025. This ensures that if all the null hypotheses are true, there is about a 95% chance of seeing no statistically significant results among all 20 comparisons and only a 5% chance of seeing one (or more) statistically significant results. The 5% significance level applies to the entire family of comparisons rather than to each of the 20 individual comparisons.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote a potential point of confusion. The value of α (usually 0.05) applies to the entire family of comparisons, but a particular comparison is declared to be statistically significant only when its P value is less than α/K (where K is the number of comparisons)1.\n\n\n\nExample of Bonferroni Correction\n\nProbability of observing specified number of significant comparisons1\n\n\nNumber of Significant Comparisons\nNo Correction\nBonferroni\n\n\n\n\n0\n35.8%\n95.1%\n\n\n1\n37.7%\n4.8%\n\n\n2+\n26.4%\n0.1%\n\n\n\n“This table assumes you are making 20 comparisons, that all 20 null hypotheses are true, and that α is set to its conventional value of 0.05.

    "text": "Specificity and Diversity\n“Specificity and diversity. Immune responses are specific for distinct antigens and often for different portions of a single complex protein, polysaccharide, or other macromolecule (Fig. 1.2). The parts of complex antigens that are specifically recognized by lymphocytes are called determinants or epitopes. This fine specificity exists because individual lymphocytes express membrane receptors that can distinguish subtle structural differences between distinct epitopes. Clones of lymphocytes with different specificities are present in unimmunized individuals and are able to recognize and respond to foreign antigens (Fig. 1.3). This fundamental concept is called clonal selection. It was clearly enunciated by Macfarlane Burnet in 1957 as a hypothesis to explain how the immune system could respond to a large number and variety of antigens. According to this hypothesis, which is now a proven feature of adaptive immunity, antigen-specific clones of lymphocytes develop before and independent of exposure to antigen. An introduced antigen binds to (selects) the cells of the preexisting antigen-specific clone and activates them, leading to an immune response specific for that antigen. The total number of antigenic specificities of the lymphocytes in an individual, called the lymphocyte repertoire, is extremely large. It is estimated that the immune system of an individual can discriminate 107 to 109 distinct antigenic determinants. This ability of the lymphocyte repertoire to recognize a very large number of antigens, called diversity, is the result of variability in the structures of the antigen-binding sites of lymphocytereceptors for antigens. In other words, there are many different clones of lymphocytes and each clone has a unique antigen receptor and therefore a singular antigen specificity, contributing to a total repertoire that is extremely diverse. The expression of different antigen receptors in different clones of T and B cells is the reason why these receptors are said to be clonally distributed. The molecular mechanisms that generate such diverse antigen receptors are discussed in Chapter 8. Diversity is essential if the immune system is to defend individuals against the many potential pathogens in the environment.”1"

Responses to second and subsequent exposures to the same antigen, called secondary immune responses, are usually more rapid, greater in magnitude, and often qualitatively different from the first, or primary, immune response to that antigen (see Fig. 1.2). Immunologic memory occurs because each exposure to an antigen generates long-lived memory cells specific for the antigen. There are two reasons why secondary responses are typically stronger than primary immune responsesmemory cells accumulate and become more numerous than the naive lymphocytes specific for the antigen that exist at the time of initial antigen exposure, and memory cells react more rapidly and vigorously to antigen challenge than do naive lymphocytes. Memory enables the immune system to mount heightened responses to persistent or recurring exposure to the same antigen and thus to combat infections by microbes that are prevalent in the environment and are encountered repeatedly.”1"

    "text": "Nonreactivity to self (Self-Tolerance)\n“Nonreactivity to self (self-tolerance). One of the most remarkable properties of every normal individual’s immune system is its ability to recognize, respond to, and eliminate many foreign (nonself) antigens while not reacting harmfully to that individual’s own (self) antigens. Immunologic unresponsiveness is also called tolerance. Tolerance to self antigens, or self-tolerance, is maintained by several mechanisms. These include eliminating lymphocytes that express receptors specific for some self antigens, inactivating self-reactive lymphocytes, or suppressing these cells by the actions of other (regulatory) cells. Abnormalities in the induction or maintenance of self-tolerance lead to immune responses against self (autologous) antigens, which may result in disorders called autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms of self-tolerance and its failure are discussed in Chapter 15. In addition to these cardinal features of adaptive immunity, these responses have some other important properties.”1\n“Because of the ability of lymphocytes and other immune cells to circulate among tissues, adaptive immunity is systemic, meaning that even if an immune response is initiated at one site it can provide protection at distant sites. This feature is, of course, essential for the success of vaccination—a vaccine administered in the subcutaneous or muscle tissue of the arm can protect from infections in any tissue.”1\n“Immune responses are regulated by a system of positive feedback loops that amplify the reaction and by control mechanisms that prevent inappropriate or pathologic reactions. When lymphocytes are activated, they trigger mechanisms that further increase the magnitude of the response. This positive feedback is important to enable the small number of lymphocytes that are specific for any microbe to generate the large response needed to eradicate that infection. Many control mechanisms become active during immune responses, which prevent excessive activation of lymphocytes that could cause collateral damage to normal tissues, and also prevent responses against self antigens.”1"

    "section": "",
    "text": "“Hip osteoarthritis is a disease manifested primarily by deteriora­ tion of the joint’s articular cartilage, loss of joint space, thickening of the joint capsule, sclerosis of subchondral bone, and the pres­ ence of osteophytes. Without an adequate damping mechanism to dissipate joint forces, the hip can experience marked degenera­ tion and change in shape. Several years ago, the American College of Rheumatology recommended the following criteria for diag­ nosing hip osteoarthritis without the use of radiography: hip pain, less than 115 degrees of hip flexion, and less than 15 degrees of internal rotation.7 The reduced range of motion may be caused by restrictions in soft tissue (such as posterior and inferior capsule or parts of the ischiofemoral ligament) and, in more severe cases, articular malalignment and osteophyte formation. Additional symptoms may include atrophy and weakness of hip muscles, morning stiffness, crepitus, inflammation of soft tissues, and an abnormal gait pattern (such as a compensated Trendelenburg gait) or altered step length. The impairments associated with advanced hip osteoarthritis can cause a significant loss in function, including difficulty climbing stairs, walking, bathing, dressing the lower extremities, getting in and out of a car, and rising from a low chair.”1\n“Hip osteoarthritis may be classified as either a primary or a secondary disease. Primary, or idiopathic, hip osteoarthritis is an arthritic condition without a known or obvious cause. Secondary hip osteoarthritis, in contrast, is an arthritic condition resulting from a known or relatively obvious mechanical disruption of the joint. This may occur from trauma or exposure to high loads; structural failure, such as a slipped capital femoral epiphysis or avascular necrosis of the femoral head (e.g., Legg­Calvé­Perthes disease); significant anatomic asymmetry or dysplasia, such as excessive acetabular or femoral anteversion; or repeated dislo­ cations and chronic instability.40,87,109 Often the source of the mechanical disruption is not so obvious and relatively subtle anatomic variations in bony structure can be a precursor to osteo­ arthritis. The resulting joint incongruity (even when slight and asymptomatic), if combined with certain habitual and usually extreme movements, can lead to repeated impingement and stress on the joint to a point of potentially triggering osteoarthritis.”1\n“Despite decades of clinical and basic science research, the exact underlying cause of primary hip osteoarthritis remains unclear.197 Although the frequency of osteoarthritis at any joint increases with age, the disease is not triggered solely by the aging process.137 If that were true, then all elderly people would eventually develop this disease. The causes of osteoarthritis are complicated and not exclusively based on a simple wear­and­tear phenomenon. Although physical stress may increase the rate and amount of wear at the hip, this does not always lead to osteoarthritis.133,189 Other factors that may be related to osteoarthritis are an altered metabo­ lism of the ground matrix of the cartilage, increased body­mass index, genetics, immune system factors, neuromuscular disorders, and biochemical factors.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Another group of patients prone to microinstability is those with borderline dysplasia who may have labral hypertrophy[37]. One of the most pertinent iatrogenic causes to consider is after hip arthroscopy, as patients may have a deficient hip capsule, leading to increased motion [38]. Physical exam is key to the understanding of this process, as microinstability is a dynamic process, which is not easily diagnosed on static imaging modalities. Ultrasound imaging of the hip has shown promise in its ability to reliably and affordably assess microinstability of the hip”1"

    "section": "Theories of Spine Stabilization",
    "text": "Theories of Spine Stabilization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBracing Mechanism\nMcGill proposed the “Bracing mechanism” (of spinal stabilization), which hypothesizes that\n\n\n“muscles act similar to guy wires when stabilizing the spine and that a loss of tension can result in unstable buckling of the spinal structures. The muscles of the trunk function via a complex interaction of agonist/antagonist spinal muscles, both segmentally and regionally to provide tension (active stiffness). According to this theory lightly pretensioning, or bracing, the abdominal muscles using an isometric contraction is a way to enhance the guy wire affect by taking up the slack prior to activities that may destabilize the spine.46 The external oblique, IO, and TrA overlay each other to create the abdominal wall and act through attachments to the abdominal and TLF to create a cylinder. As the intra-abdominal pressure increases, the three-dimensional force per unit area exerted on the spine also increases, potentially constraining spinal movement in all directions.”2\n\n\n\n\nDeep Corset Mechanism\nProposed by Richardson\n\n\n“Richardson et al.45 have proposed that a pressure corset is formed by the muscles of the lumbar spine. Under this proposal, the TrA forms the wall of the cylinder, and the muscles of the pelvic floor and diaphragm form the base and lid, respectively. Within this system, the intra-abdominal pressure group is maintained at a level that provides spinal support. Since the abdominal cavity has a finite volume, the intra-abdominal pressure (force/area) will increase if the abdominal cavity volume is reduced (contraction of the muscles in the pelvic floor, abdominal muscles and diaphragm, and the wearing of a lumbar corset) In addition, the increase in intra-abdominal pressure is thought to provide a mild distractive force to the spinal segments, due to separation of the pelvic floor and diaphragm. Because intra-abdominal pressure and fascial tension are important for the control of intervertebral motion, the muscles that surround the abdominal cavity, such as the diaphragm and the pelvic floor muscles (see Chapter 29), provide an additional contribution. These two muscle groups also have important respiratory and continence functions. Theoretically, reduced contribution of the diaphragm to spinal stability may occur during periods of increased respiratory demand. As the diaphragm descends during inspiration, intra-abdominal pressure increases provided that the musculature of the abdominal and pelvic floor maintains its respective tension.”2"

The patient is positioned in sitting with their forearm supinated. With one hand, the clinician grasps the scaphoid. With the other hand, the clinician grasps the lunate between the thumb and the index finger (Fig. 18-54). The lunate and scaphoid are then sheared in an anterior (palmar) and then posterior (dorsal) direction. Laxity and reproduction of the patient’s pain are positive signs for this test.2\n\n\n\nTendon special tests\n\nThe Integrity of the Central Slip (Extensor Hood Rupture). The patient flexes the finger to 90 degrees at the PIP joint over the edge of the table. The patient is then asked to extend the PIP joint, while the clinician palpates the middle phalanx (Fig. 18-57). The absence of extension force at the PIP joint and fixed extension at the distal joint indicates complete rupture of the central slip. No diagnostic accuracy2\n\n\n\nLigament Special Tests\n\nLunotriquetral Shear (Reagan) Test. This test is designed to assess the integrity of the lunotriquetral ligament. The clinician grasps the triquetrum between the thumb and the second finger of one hand and the lunate with the thumb and second finger of the other hand. The lunate is moved posteriorly (dorsally) with the thumb of one hand, while the triquetrum is pushed palmarly in the anteroposterior (AP) plane by the index finger of the other hand (Fig. 18-44). Crepitation, clicks, or discomfort in this area suggests injury to the ligament.2\nThe Pisotriquetral Shear Test. The pisotriquetral shear test assesses the integrity of the pisotriquetral articulation. The clinician stabilizes the wrist with the fingers posterior (dorsal) to the triquetrum and the thumb over the pisiform. The pisiform is rocked back and forth in a medial and lateral direction. A positive test is manifested with pain during this maneuver. No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this test.\nPivot Shift Test of the Midcarpal Joint. The patient is positioned in sitting with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and the forearm pronated. The clinician uses one hand to stabilize the forearm while using the other hand to take the patient’s hand into full radial deviation (Fig. 18-59). The patient’s hand is then taken into full ulnar deviation. A positive test results if the capitate is felt to shift away from the lunate and indicates an injury to the anterior capsule and interosseous ligaments. No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and the specificity of this test.\nScaphoid Shift Test for Carpal Instability. The scaphoid shift maneuver examines the dynamic stability of the wrist, in particular, the integrity of the scapholunate ligament. The patient is positioned in sitting with their elbow in approximately 90 degrees of flexion, the forearm slightly pronated, and the wrist ulnarly deviated. The clinician grasps the wrist from the radial side and stabilizes the scaphoid tubercle with the thumb and the posterior (dorsal) aspect of the scaphoid with the index finger. The clinician uses the other hand to grasp the metacarpals. Starting in ulnar deviation and slight extension, the wrist is moved into radial deviation and slight flexion. As the wrist is brought passively into radial deviation, the normal flexion of the proximal row forces the scaphoid tubercle into an anterior (palmar) direction (into the clinician’s thumb). The clinician attempts to prevent the anterior (palmar) motion of the scaphoid. When the scaphoid is unstable, its proximal pole is forced to sublux posteriorly (dorsally).22 Pain at the posterior (dorsal) wrist or a clunk suggests instability. The results are compared with the other hand. The results from the scaphoid shift test should be used with caution, as the test can be positive in up to one-third of uninjured individuals. One study looked at the movements of the carpal bones during the scaphoid shift test radiographically in 60 wrists and found that pain associated with subluxation of the scaphoid during the shift test is a significant finding, and that radiographic analysis of the test may confirm a positive result when dynamic scaphoid instability is suspected.22\nGamekeeper’s or Skier’s Thumb. The patient is positioned in sitting. The clinician stabilizes the patient’s hand with one hand and takes the patient’s thumb into extension with the other hand. While maintaining the thumb into extension, the clinician applies a valgus stress to the MCP joint of the thumb to stress the UCL (Fig. 18-60). A positive test is present if the valgus movement is greater than 30–35 degrees, indicating a complete tear of the UCL and the accessory collateral ligaments.\nMurphy Sign. The patient is asked to make a fist. If the head of the third metacarpal is level with the second and fourth metacarpals, the sign is positive for the presence of a lunate dislocation.\n\n\n\nNeurovascular Special Teests\n\nAllen Test. The Allen test is used to determine the patency of the vessels supplying the hand. The clinician compresses both the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist (Fig. 18-61), and then asks the patient to open and clench the fist three to four times to drain the venous blood from the hand. The patient is then asked to hold the hand open while the clinician releases the pressure on the ulnar artery and then the radial artery. The fingers and palm should be seen to regain their normal pink color. This procedure is repeated with the radial artery released and compression on the ulnar artery maintained. Normal filling time is usually less than 5 seconds. A distinct difference in the filling time suggests the dominance of one artery filling the hand.\nTinel (Percussion) Test for CTS. The Tinel test is used to assist in the diagnosis of CTS. The area over the median nerve is tapped gently at the anterior (palmar) surface of the wrist (Fig. 18-62). If this produces tingling in the median nerve distribution, then the test is positive. Variations exist among studies on the location and number of taps necessary to elicit a positive response, and in some studies the test is performed by tapping the median nerve in 20 degrees of wrist extension, while others tap along the path of the median nerve up to where the median nerve enters the carpal tunnel.\nAPB Weakness for CTS. The patient is positioned in sitting with their hand supported by the clinician. The clinician asked the patient to touch the pads of the thumb and small finger together. After asking the patient to keep the pads of the thumb and small finger together, the clinician applies a strong force in order to resist thumb abduction (Fig. 18-63). A positive test is a weakness in some abduction with resisted testing as compared to the other hand. Studies performed to determine weakness in the APB are relatively consistent, demonstrating moderate diagnostic accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nPathologies\n\nGamekeeper’s Thumb (Skier’s Thumb)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The grind test is used to assess the integrity of the thumb CMC joint by axially loading the thumb metacarpal into the trapezium. The clinician grasps the thumb metacarpal using the thumb and index finger of one hand and the proximal aspect of the thumb CMC joint with the other hand (Fig. 18-42). An axial compressive force, combined with rotation, is applied to the thumb CMC joint. Reproduction of the patient’s pain and crepitus is a positive test for arthrosis and synovitis2\nLichtman Test. The Lichtman test is a provocative test for midcarpal instability. The patient’s forearm is positioned in pronation, and the hand is held relaxed and supported by the clinician. The clinician gently moves the patient’s hand from radial to ulnar deviation while compressing the carpus into the radius (Fig. 18-43). A positive test is when the midcarpal row appears to jump or snap from an anteriorly (palmarly) subluxed position to the height of the proximal row.2\nLinscheid Test. The Linscheid test is used to detect ligamentous injury and instability of the second and third CMC joints. The test is performed by supporting the metacarpal shafts and pressing distally on the metacarpal heads in anterior (palmar) (Fig. 18-44) and posterior (dorsal) directions. A positive test produces pain localized to the CMC joints.2\nCarpal Shake Test. This test is used if intercarpal synovitis is suspected. The clinician grasps the patient’s distal forearm. The patient is asked to relax, and the clinician shakes the wrist (Fig. 18-45). Pain or resistance to this test indicates a positive test.2\nWrist Flexion and Finger Extension Test. The patient is positioned in sitting with the elbow placed on the table. The clinician holds the patient’s wrist in flexion and asks the patient to extend the fingers against manual resistance (Fig. 18-46). A positive test for scapholunate pathology is identified by pain over the scaphoid. No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this test.\nTFCC Stress Test.19 The patient is positioned in sitting with the elbow placed on the table, the forearm in neutral, and the wrist in ulnar deviation. The clinician fixates the distal forearm and then applies a shear force across the ulnar complex of the wrist. The reproduction of pain and/or clicking with this maneuver is a positive test for a TFCC lesion.2\nTFCC Compression Test.19 The patient is positioned in sitting with the elbow placed on the table and the forearm in neutral. The clinician holds the patient’s wrist and applies an ulnarly directed shear to the wrist. The reproduction of pain and/or clicking with this maneuver is a positive test for a TFCC lesion.\nPress (Sit to Stand) Test. This test is used if a tear of the TFCC is suspected.20 The patient is instructed to place both hands on the armrests of a chair and attempt to lift their body slightly off the chair (Fig. 18-47). Pain or resistance to this test indicates a positive test.\nSupination Lift Test. The patient is positioned in sitting with the elbows flexed to 90 degrees and the forearms supinated. The patient is asked to place the palms flat on the underside of the heavy table or against the clinician’s hands. The patient is asked to lift the table or push up against the resisting clinician’s hands (Fig. 18-48). A positive test for a TFCC tear is pain localized to the ulnar side of the wrist with difficulty applying force.\nUlnar Impaction Test. This test is used to assess the articulation between the ulnar carpus and the TFCC. The patient is positioned in sitting, with the elbow flexed to about 90 degrees and the wrist positioned in ulnar deviation, and the fingers positioned in a slight fist. The clinician loads the wrist by applying a compressive force through the ring and small metacarpals (Fig. 18-49). Pain with this test indicates a possible tear of the TFCC or ulnar impaction syndrome (see “Intervention Strategies”).2\nFinkelstein’s Test. This test is used to detect stenosing tenosynovitis of the APL and EPB. The clinician grasps the patient’s thumb, stabilizes the forearm with one hand, and then deviates the wrist to the ulnar side with the other hand (Fig. 18-50). No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this test, so the results of this test must be interpreted with caution, as it may also be positive in Wartenberg syndrome (entrapment of the superficial radial sensory nerve), basilar thumb arthrosis, EPB entrapment, or intersection syndrome (see “Intervention Strategies”). Deviating the wrist using pressure over the index metacarpal avoids confusion with thumb conditions. A variation of Finkelstein test can be used to rule out an incomplete release of previous de Quervain disease. If the usual Finkelstein test is positive, full abduction of the APL followed by flexion of the thumb’s MCP joint will isolate the action of the EPB. Pain with this test will occur if the EPB lies in a separate sheath and was not released (EPB entrapment syndrome). This test has been found to have a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 50%.212\nRadioulnar Ballottement Test. The radioulnar ballottement test is used to assess DRUJ instability. The patient’s elbow is flexed, and the clinician uses their thumb and index finger to stabilize the radius radially and the ulnar head ulnarly (Fig. 18-51). Stress is applied in an anterior–posteriordirection. Normally there is no movement in the anterior or posterior direction in maximum supination or pronation. Pain or mobility with this test is suggestive of radioulnar instability.\nWartenberg Test. The Wartenberg test is used with patients who complain of pain over the distal radial forearm associated with paresthesias over the posterior (dorsal) radial hand (Wartenberg syndrome). These patients frequently report symptom magnification with wrist movement or when tightly pinching the thumb and index digit together. The Wartenberg test involves tapping the index finger over the superficial radial nerve (similar to the Tinel test for CTS) on the posterior and radial side of the wrist (Fig. 18-52). A positive test is indicated by local tenderness and paresthesia with this maneuver. Hyperpronation of the forearm can also cause a positive Tinel sign.\nFinger Extension Test. This test is used to demonstrate posterior (dorsal) wrist syndrome, a localized scapholunate synovitis. The clinician instructs the patient to fully flex the wrist and then actively extend the digits at both the IP and MCP joints. The clinician then applies pressure on the fingers into flexion at the MCP joints while the patient continues to actively extend (Fig. 18-53). A positive test occurs when there is production of central posterior (dorsal) wrist pain and indicates the possibility of Kienböck disease, carpal instability, joint degeneration, or synovitis (see “Intervention Strategies”).\n\n\n\nTendinous Integrity\n\nFDS Test. This test is used to test the integrity of the FDS tendon. The clinician holds the patient’s fingers except for the finger being tested (this isolates the FDS tendon). The patient is instructed to flex the finger at the PIP joint (Fig. 18-55). If this is possible, the FDS tendon is intact. Since this tendon can act independently because of the position of the finger, it is the only functioning tendon at the PIP joint. The DIP joint, motored by the FDP, has no power of flexion when the other fingers are held in extension.\nFDP Test. These tendons work only in unison. To test the FDP, the PIP joint and the MCP joints are stabilized in extension (Fig. 18-56). The patient is asked to flex this finger at the DIP joint. If flexion occurs, the FDP is intact. If no flexion is possible, the tendon is severed, or the muscle denervated.\n\n\n\nLigament Special Tests\n\nUlnar Piano Key Sign\n\n\n\nNeurovascular Tests\n\nPhalen Test for CTS. For the Phalen test, the patient sits comfortably with the wrists and elbows flexed (Fig. 18-64). The test is positive if the patient experiences numbness or tingling throughout the median nerve distribution of the hand within 45 seconds. For some patients, the performance of this test recreates their wrist, thumb, or forearm ache. Some studies have varied this test to be performed by the patient with wrist in complete flexion and elbow extended, bilateral wrist flexion with the posterior aspect of the hand pressing against one another, or passive wrist flexion by the clinician. The original Phalen test has demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 47%, making it moderately acceptable for use in clinical practice\nReverse Phalen Test for CTS. A reverse Phalen position is the same as the Phalen except the palms are placed together (Fig. 18-65). The patient is asked to keep both hands with the wrists in complete extension for 60 seconds (wrist and finger extension).\nHand Elevation Test for CTS. The patient is seated or standing and is asked to elevate both arms above the head (Fig. 18-66) and maintain them in this position until the patient feels paresthesia or numbness.23 A positive test is the reproduction of symptoms such as paresthesia and numbness in the median nerve distribution after raising the arms for no greater than 2 minutes. A study by Ahn23 found this test to have a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 99% (LR+ 76; LR− .24). In another study,23 this test was found to be more specific than the Phalen and Tinel tests. Although this clinical test has high diagnostic values, there are numerous procedural biases in both study designs. In addition, the test may be positive in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome.\nWrist Flexion and Median Nerve Compression. The patient is positioned in sitting with the elbow fully extended, the forearm in supination and the wrist flexed to 60 degrees. The clinician applies an even constant pressure over the median nerve at the carpal tunnel using the thumb. A positive test for CTS is the reproduction of symptoms along the median nerve distribution within 30 seconds.\nMedian Nerve Compression Test/Pressure Provocation Test. The clinician sits opposite to the patient and holds the patient’s hand with the clinician’s thumbs directly over the course of the median nerve as it passes under the flexor retinaculum between the FCR and the palmaris longus. The clinician places gentle sustained pressure with the thumbs for 15 seconds to 2 minutes. The clinician then removes the pressure and questions the patient on the relief of symptoms, which may take a few minutes. A positive test is the reproduction of pain, paresthesia, or numbness distal to the site of compression during the compression in the distribution of the median nerve.\nFlick Maneuver. The patient is positioned in sitting and is asked to vigorously shake his or her hands (Fig. 18-67). A positive test, indicating CTS, is the resolution of the paresthesia symptoms during or following administration of flicking the wrist. There appears to be some confusion as to what constitutes a flick. Some studies define a flick as a rapid, alternating movement up and down of the wrist, whereas others describe the positive flick with as little movement as elbow extension. The diagnostic usefulness of this test is outlined in\nSemmes–Weinstein Monofilament Testing. The palm of the hand is divided into several areas, and only one point (usually in the center) is tested in each area.\n\nBetween the fingertip and DIP joint.\nBetween the DIP joint and PIP joint.\nBetween the PIP joint and finger web."

In addition, a surgical operation known as a coxa vara (or valga) osteotomy intentionally alters a preexisting angle of inclina­ tion. This operation involves cutting a wedge of bone from the proximal femur, thereby changing the orientation of the femoral head to the acetabulum. A goal of this operation is often to improve the congruency of the weight­bearing surfaces of the hip.e”3"

First, its axis of rotation is located at one end of a bone. Second, the muscle, or internal force, possesses greater leverage than the external force. Second-class levers are very rare in the musculoskeletal system. The classic example is the calf muscles producing the torque needed to stand on tiptoes (see Fig. 1.23B). The axis of rotation for this action is assumed to act through the metatarsophalangeal joints. Based on this assumption, the internal moment arm used by the calf muscles greatly exceeds the external moment arm used by body weight.”1\n\n\n3rd Class\n“As in the second-class lever, the third-class lever has its axis of rotation located at one end of a bone. The elbow flexor muscles use a third-class lever to produce the flexion torque required to support a weight in the hand (see Fig. 1.23C). Unlike with the second-class lever, the external weight supported by a third-class lever always has greater leverage than the muscle force. The third-class lever is the most common lever used by the musculoskeletal system.”1\n\n\nMechanical Advantage\n“The mechanical advantage (MA) of a musculoskeletal lever can be defined as the ratio of the internal moment arm to the external moment arm. Depending on the location of the axis of rotation, the first-class lever can have an MA equal to, less than, or greater than 1. Second-class levers always have an MA greater than 1. As depicted in the boxes associated with Fig. 1.23A–B, lever systems with an MA greater than 1 are able to balance the torque equilibrium equation by an internal (muscle) force that is less than the external force. Third-class levers always have an MA less than 1. As depicted in Fig. 1.23C, in order to balance the torque equilibrium equation, the muscle must produce a force much greater than the opposing external force.”1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This phenomenon was first noted by Reinhold Ganz in early descriptions of FAI [18]. The test has been described in both the supine and lateral recumbent position (with the affected side up). The examiner passively brings the hip into flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (Figure 4). Reproduction of pain is considered a positive test and diagnostic of FAI [16,19,20]. One study of patients with symptomatic hip pain evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the anterior impingement test and FADDIR test, which they found to be 80%; however, their specificity was quite low at 26% and 24%, respectively [21]. Often a combination of physical exam maneuvers throughout a range of motion is the best way to dynamically stress the hip on exam to potentially reproduce the symptoms causing discomfort, and this was reflected in their same study, as the most specific maneuver was passive hip range of motion in an internally rotated and neutrally flexed hip [21]. When testing FADDIR specifically in 90° of hip flexion, this maneuver is sometimes referred to as the anterior impingement test [16,22].”1\n\nPsychometrics\n\n\n\nPsychometric\nScore\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity\n59-100%1\n\n\nSpecificity\n10-100%1\n\n\ninter-rater reliability\n96%1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A positive Neer impingement test result is thought to represent impingement of the RC on the anterosuperior glenoid rim or coracoacromial ligament. MacDonald et al.120 demonstrated 75% sensitivity of the Neer sign for subacromial bursitis but overall poor specificity.”1\n“The Neer impingement sign test29 was performed with the patient in a standing position.

A positive test for subacromial impingement is indicated if the patient reports shoulder pain in the 60–120-degree range. Pain outside this range is considered a negative test, and pain that increases in severity as the arm reaches 180 degrees is indicative of “a disorder of the A-C joint.” The painful arc test has a specificity of 80%.127 However, although this test is good at detecting subacromial impingement, a positive finding is unlikely to aid the clinician in determining a specific diagnosis as there are a number of conditions that can be provoked with arm elevation (Table 16-25)”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The patient elevates the hand and repeatedly makes a fist while the examiner places digital occlusive pressure over the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist. The hand will lose its normal pink color. Digital pressure is released from one artery (usually the ulnar), while the other, i.e., the radial, remains compressed. If there is normal blood flow through the unobstructed artery, color should return to the hand within 10 sec. The return of color indicates that the hand has a good collateral supply of blood and that arterial puncture of the compressed artery can be safely performed.”\n\n\n\nCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYomogida N, Kerstein C.

To test the lower three segments (L3–5), the patient’s hips are placed in approximately 70 degrees of flexion, and the knees are flexed (Fig. 28-48A). This position is to prevent tightening of the posterior lumbar ligaments, particularly the SSL, which could stabilize the lower three segments and produce a false-negative test result. The clinician stands to face the patient, resting his or her thighs against the patient’s knees. The upper segments are stabilized using the cranial hand and the other hand over it. The inferior interspinous space is palpated. The clinician pushes with the thighs, through the patient’s knees, along the line of the femur (Fig. 28-48B). This produces a posteriorly directed force to the pelvis, sacrum, and lumbar spine. Any posterior movement of the inferior segment, which is actually a relative anterior movement of the superior segment on the inferior segment, is noted and compared with the next segmental level. There should be little or no movement. To test the upper two segments (L2 and L1), the lumbar spine is flexed by flexing the hips to approximately 100 degrees, and the procedure is repeated. A positive test is one in which there is excessive movement or pain, or both.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Dutton M. Dutton’s Orthopaedic Examination, Evaluation, and Intervention. 5th ed.

    "text": "“The patient is positioned prone so that the trunk rests on the bed, and the feet rest on the floor, with the hips flexed and the trunk muscles relaxed. The clinician applies a P-A pressure (approximately 4 kg or thumbnail blanching) over the most symptomatic spinous process, and any reproduction of symptoms is noted. The clinician then releases the P-A pressure, and the patient is asked to hold onto the sides of the table and to slightly lift his or her feet off the floor (Fig. 28-50). This maneuver produces a cocontraction of the global abdominal, gluteal, and erector spinae muscles. While the patient maintains their feet off the floor, the clinician reapplies the P-A pressure over the same spinous process level. If a dramatic reduction or the complete elimination of the symptoms compared to the first application of P-A pressure is noted (the muscle activity must be able to effectively stabilize the segment), it is considered a positive prone instability test. This test has been found to have good to excellent agreement reported (k = 0.87)92 for three pairs of physical therapy raters evaluating 63 consecutive subjects currently experiencing LBP and with a previous history of LBP. According to Hicks et al.,92 patients with LBP, who present with a negative prone instability test, are unlikely to respond to a stabilization exercise program. However, it must be remembered that as an independent test, the Prone Instability Test has limited diagnostic use (+LR = 1.7[95% CI; 1.1, 2.8]; -LR = 0.48 [95% CI: 0.22, 1.1])130; as it is most useful as a component of a cluster of tests to predict response to motor control exercises.”1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

When the patient is told to abduct the paretic leg, the entire movement set becomes weak.

If you need to stall up and wait for the section to start closing out. If you watch pros they’ll frequently stomp the tail and wait for the wave to wall up more, then pump down the line a few times before launching off the lip.\nAs far as how long it takes, it just depends on the person and I think more importantly age. I learned to surf around 8-10 and didn’t learn to do a real air until 8th grade. So however long that is was my time taken. Im 30 now and still trying to learn how to do new grabs and rotations. Also, I think as a kid its a bit easier as you are trying to one up all your friends etc and have 8hr surf days and endless energy haha."

You don’t need super long waves, you just need the right section that throws a nice lip and you need to time it right. I’d recommend practicing stalling up high on the wave next to the white water while you wait for the close out section to stand up, then pump and get some speed and hit the lip at the right time and you’ll do an air. It’s all about timing. You want the lip to hit you forward toward the beach so you don’t go out the back of the wave. Having a super light board will help too because it’s very quick and lighter so it will go in the air easier."

    "text": "Chronological Movement analysis\nPreparatory phase: The preparatory phase parallels the “approach phase” from Forsyth et al., (2018). In this phase, we assume the surfer is already standing on the surfboard and riding the wave. The preparatory phase begins before the surfer performs the bottom turn to perform the aerial (Forsyth et al 2018). The surfer must determine when he should time the initiation of the aerial as well as how much speed he should have. Based on these decisions, the surfer will either “pump” to increase speed or “stall” to decrease speed Once the surfer is at his/her desired speed, they will perform the bottom turn which will decide his/her initial trajectory up the wave and towards the “lip.” The surfer should keep their center of mass low and toward the board. As the surfer rides up towards the “lip” (the top of the breaking wave) they should keep their “toeside” rail (edge of the surfboard) submerged in order to increase depth of the “triple extension” movement, so they can launch into the air (Forsyth 2018).\n\nTake-off Phase\n\nThe movement phase includes both “take-off” and “airborne” phases in Forsyth’s 4 phase model of surfing aerials (Forsyth 2018).\nAs the surfer rides up the lip, the preparatory phase ends and the movement phase begins. The takeoff to airborne phase can be broken down into one mental idea: Compressing yourself and the board into the wave as if the wave was a spring, then “bouncing” off that spring into the air and away from the wave.\nTo “take-off” the surfer shifts their COM towards their back foot by performing hip and knee flexion in the lead leg and simultaneously extending the rear knee and plantar flexing the rear ankle.\n\nThis weight shift will raise the “nose” (Front end of the surfboard)\n\nThere is also a rotation component that is added to the extension moment.\n\nAs the surfer flexes his lead leg and extends his rear leg, he/she should be rotating away from the rear leg (relative external hip rotation) as well as contralateral rotation (away from the rear leg) at the spine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAccording to Forsyth et al., the surfer should “swing their arms upward and use the moment of the lip to accelerate him/herself upward and forward relative to the wave.”1 I agree that one should use trunk and UE momentum to propel themselves forward and upward, but I believe this result comes from multiple structures rotating away from the rear leg in the transverse and sagittal plane, rather than swinging your arms upward in the sagittal plane.\n\n\n\n\nAirborne Phase\nOnce the surfer has left the wave, the airborne phase has begun\n\nOnce the surfer has left the surface of the wave, they should perform hip flexion and knee flexion in order to bring their lower limbs toward their chest1.\nThis is done to allow the surfboard to carry momentum as well so it stays connected to the surfer’s feet.\nAlthough the board will be pushing off the wave with you after the previous action, there is nothing “gluing” the board to your feet\nThus, during the flight phase, the surfer needs to keep his/her COM and COG over the board.\nThis is accomplished by keeping one’s chest over the knees and extending the lower extremities into the board to maintain contact with the board until the landing phase.\nThis allows them to gain maximum elevation whilst ensuring they are prepared to land in a stable position\n\n\n\nLanding phase\nThe landing phase is the 4th and final phase described by Forsyth et al.,1\nThe recovery phase coincides with Forsyth’s final phase, the “landing phase” and begins when the surfboard makes contact with the wave (Forsyth 2018). In the last phase (airborne phase) the surfer was extending his/her lower extremities into the board to maintain contact In this phase, the surfer continues to extend at the hips and knees, not only to maintain contact witht he board, but also to increase the ROM of eccentric triple extension during the landing Increased ROM allows the surfer to absorb the vertical forces for a longer period of time The surfer should land with almost full extension, but careful not to place the knees into hyperextension. To absorb the vertical loads, the surfer will eccentrically move through triple extension. The surfer should lean their trunk over their lead knee in order to maintain his COM within his BOS. This brings their center of mass forward over the board in an attempt to successfully complete the maneuver Keeping the center of mass toward the front foot is important since the surfboard will be pushed forward by the wave, thus the surfer’s BOS will be moving anteriorly under a stationary COM during landing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt should benotd that Forsyth et al., identified 52 performance variables that likely contribute to successful or unsuccessful aerial performance (Forsyth 2018)."

    "text": "Critical Features\n\nCritical features\n\nCritical Feature (i): Landing with lead ankle in dorsiflexion1\nCritical Feature (ii): Landing with feet greater than hip width apart1\nCritical Feature (iii): Landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard1\n\n\n\nLead ankle\n Critical Feature (i): Landing with lead ankle in dorsiflexion. During landing tasks, athletes aim to move through the greatest available range of joint motion in order to dampen the impact forces they experience27. This is typically characterised by athletes displaying a plantar flexed ankle at initial ground contact to enable the largest possible range of ankle joint motion during the subsequent landing thereby increasing the time over which the impact forces are absorbed\nResults of the present study, however, have shown that landing an aerial with the lead (front) ankle in a dorsiflexed position at initial board-wave contact, rather than a plantar flexed position, was significantly associated with a successful landing\nExplanation: This apparently contradictory finding can be explained by the need for a surfer to maintain contact with their surfboard throughout the final stages of the airborne phase and into the landing phase of the aerial manoeuvre 1\n\n\nRear ankle\n During the airborne phase, plantar flexion of the rear ankle would result in downward movement of the surfboard tail. As there is a need to maintain constant contact with the surfboard, this downward movement of the surfboard tail would assist in keeping the nose of the surfboard up, leaving the lead ankle in a dorsiflexed position 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRear ankle coupled movements\n\n\n\n“Dorsiflexing the ankle is also likely to be coupled with knee flexion, which would ensure the surfer’s total body centre of mass remains within their base of support, as well as over the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard”1\n\n\n\n\nBase of Support\n A wider base of support enhances stability when performing a discrete skill, and was also evident when landing aerials in surfing. A wide base of support provides a greater area over which a surfer’s total body centre of gravity can travel before generating a perturbing torque. This increased tolerance for error is particularly useful when trying to land on a largely unpredictable surface such as a wave. A wide stance also helps the surfer position their centre of mass closer to the centre of buoyance of the surfboard, as discussed below (see Critical Feature (iii)) 1\n\n\nCenter of Mass (COM)\nThe third clinical feature described by Forsyth (2018) was “Landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard”1\n was Due to the relative unpredictability of surfing and the open nature of a surfing environment, ensuring a surfer lands over the centre of their surfboard is essential to limit the effect of any unexpected perturbations, which might occur because of the changing water surface. Positioning the total body centre of mass directly above the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard reduces the potential to generate any destabilising torques31 during landing. The effect of not adhering to this critical feature was evident in the FS Air Reverse when athletes landed with their total body centre of mass over the nose of the surfboard, which was significantly associated with unsuccessful performance of the manoeuvre (see Table 4). 1\nQ3: What injuries may be associated or caused by repeating this motion? Why?\nThere is not much research on injuries due to repeated motion of this movement. The main risk of this movement is the landing that requires much power to absorb the landing while maintaining stability on an unstable surface. For these reasons, Forsyth found that there was an association between performing aerials and acute lower limb injury (Forsyth 2018).\n“When landing an aerial manoeuvre, surfers are required to absorb and arrest high forces and impact velocities as they fall from the air and make contact with the surface of the wave. A surfer’s ability to successfully perform and control these landings may influence the forces experienced across the lower limb joints” (Forsyth 2018)."

    "text": "Overview\nHere are historical and current theories of child development. Dynamic systems theory is common in pediatirc physical therapy. Neuronal group selection theory is the most common in physical therapy in general. It should be noted that none of these theories are correct.\n\n\nNeuromaturational Theory\n\nDevelopment follows a set, invariant sequence1.\nDevelopment is tightly tied to CNS development1.\nMotor development is cephalocaudal and proximal to distal1.\nRecent modifications acknowledge variations in the sequence and input from all systems1.\n\nMcGraw & Gesell were the main proponents of the original theory, which consisted of a step type sequence of development and intervention, Not totally linear, but more or less linear\nNewer version: Can you adapt /change pattern?\n\nCNS maturation drives development\nNormal sequence / hierarchy of skill development\nClassic developmental scales based on this work\nImportance of developmental reflexes and stepwise sequence of development in intervention\n\nClinical significance: Alternating progression and Regression\n\nAs you start to master one skill, and you introduce the other skill, you may see a regression is previous skill or new skill wont look perfect.\nDevelopment happens in a proximal to distal sequence, motor skills develop gross to fine\nDevelopment is dynamic and characterized by alternating advancement and regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrawling Example\n\n\n\nChild beings to crawl using a symmetrical arm pattern. As they develop, the progress to an alternating UE pattern.\n\n\nRegression to earlier patterns as more mature version occurs\n\n\nCognitive Theory\nIn the cognitive theory, thinking develops in stages of increasing complexity1. Children organize mental schemes through the use of mental operations1.\nPiaget formulated the Cognitive development theory, which proposese that the child’s active involvement in environment (not just neuromaturation) critical to infant development.\n\n4 stages of Cognitive Development\n\n\nStage\nAge\nAction\n\n\n\n\nSensorimotor\n0-2\nReflex activity leads to purposeful movement\n\n\nPre-operational\n2-7\nUnidimensional awareness of environment\n\n\nConcrete operational\n7-11\nLess egocentric, solve concrete probs\n\n\nFormal operational\n11+\nSolve abstract probs, deductive reasoning\n\n\n\n\nScaffolding: parents/therapists provide environmental challenge that encourages a child to perform higher level skill\nSome EC programs based on this\n\nMontessori: uses cognitive and developmental theories\n\nChild given freedom to interact and engage in environment and self select activities from specialized materials\n\nReggio emilia: investigatory and exploratory environment helps with problem solving skills\n\n\n\n\nBehavioral Theory\n\nMain proponent: Pavlov\nStimulus/response approach\nModify behavior thru manipulating stimuli\nModifying parameters such as intensity/freq/etc\n\nABA- application of behavioral theory\nGet a reward for a desired action\n\nAssumes most behaviors are learned responses\nPositive and negative reinforcements\n\n\n\nDynamic Systems Theory\n\nCommonly used theory in pediatric PT\nMain proponents: Shumway-Cooke, Thelen, Herriza, woolacott\nEmphasis on process rather than product\nResults of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, cooperation of systems\nDevelopment is nonlinear\nMvmt occurs based on child’s internal factors/ motivators, external environmental dn motor task to be completed\nHow u do it more important than outcomes\nprocess&gt; product\n\n\n\nNeuronal Group Selection Theory\n\nCNS influence on development\nBrain organized into population of cells (units) containing individually variable networks (neuronal groups)\nstructure / function of these groups influenced by evolution, environment, behavior\nLike DST , development is non linear BUT GENETICS is as important as experience to shape development\nInterplay between neuroanatomy adn experience form maps that connect neuronal groups\n\nDynamic systems = most common in PT\n\n\nDevelopmental Direction\n\nReflexive to cortical: we start off w reflexive mvmts and we generally are able to override as we age\nProx to distal\nExtensor control to flexor control\nGeneralized to localized (gross motor to fine)\nMedial to lateral\nOpen to closed chain (mobility to stability)\nAsymmetric to symmetric development (super important in children, if u see asymmetrical things happening, it should be a yellow flag!!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Corticospinal tract lesions give rise to a spastic gait, unilateral or hemiparetic when the lesion is unilateral and paraparetic when the lesion is bilateral. The base of support is narrow, so much so that with bilateral lesions the legs tend to cross in front of each other in a pattern that has been called “scissors gait.” The leg is externally rotated at the hip. The knee is extended and stiff, so the patient walks as if on a stilt. The foot is plantar flexed and inverted; for this reason, the patient tends to scrape the floor with the outer edge of the foot; the patient’s turns are slow. With each step the affected leg is rotated away from the body, then toward it (circumduction). There is also difficulty picking up the toes on the hemiparetic side, when instructed to walk on the heels and decrease cadence of gait. The lesion can be anywhere along the corticospinal tract. When the lesion is unilateral, the abnormality is easy to diagnose.1\nBilateral lesions, particularly when they cause a slowly progressive syndrome, are more difficult to diagnose early in the course of the disease. The cervical myelopathy of cervical spondylosis, a relatively common syndrome, belongs to this category. Cervical spondylosis tends to cause demyelinating lesions in the posterior columns and corticospinal tracts of the cervical spinal cord. The most common place of involvement is at the C5 C6 interspace. Severe lesions in this location result in paraparesis and clumsiness of the hand with atrophy in the small muscles of the hand. Milder lesions may only give rise to unsteadiness while walking or standing, often accompanied by a positive Romberg sign [43]. The brachioradialis reflex may be depressed, and instead, a brisk finger flexor response is elicited when percussing the brachioradialis tendon (inverted radial reflex). Careful testing of vibratory sense may reveal a sensory level in the cervical region. Sometimes, the patient perceives the stimulus better in the thumb than in the small finger. Early diagnosis is important because the myelopathy of cervical spondylosis is often progressive if untreated [59].1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Brazis PW, Masdeu JC, Biller J.

    "text": "Lesions of the anterior lobe of the cerebellum can also be accompanied by a discrete impairment in gait, and those affecting the flocculonodular lobe affect equilibrium [29]. Cerebellar lesions may affect gait by causing disequilibrium and by altering limb and trunk kinematics and interlimb coordination [20]. The cerebellum does not appear to actually generate postural and gait synergies because these automatic responses, albeit very dysmetric, are present in dogs with total cerebellectomy [58]. Disturbances of gait and balance are primarily caused by lesions of the vestibulocerebellum and spinocerebellum or their connections. Lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres cause irregular timing, force, and cadence of leg movements, leading to inaccurate and variable stepping [32]. Lesions of the vestibulocerebellum, or flocculonodular lobe, can produce1\nbalance and gait disturbances that resemble those caused by vestibular lesions [20]. Tremor of the head and trunk, truncal imbalance, and swaying and falling in all directions are characteristic of vestibulocerebellar lesions. Vestibular nystagmus may be present. Although most often patients with cerebellar lesions tend to fall to the side of the lesion, some patients with lesions in the tonsillar area develop increased tone (and increased reflexes) in the ipsilateral side and fall to the contralateral side. The clinical syndrome caused by lesions of the spinocerebellum is best characterized by alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, which primarily affects the anterior lobe of the cerebellum but also involves the olivary complex and the vestibular nuclei [71]. Patients with alcoholic cerebellar degeneration have a widened base, instability of the trunk, slow and halting gait with irregular steps and superimposed lurching. The gait abnormalities are accentuated at the initiation of gait, on turning, and with changes in gait speed. These patients may have severe gait ataxia without nystagmus, dysarthria, or arm dysmetria. Even the heel-to-shin test may give little inkling of the severity of the gait disturbance. The anterior lobe of the cerebellum is exquisitely sensitive to many metabolic injuries, not just alcohol. For instance, in severe hypoxia, the anterior lobe can be severely damaged, whereas the rest of the cerebellum may be spared1.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Brazis PW, Masdeu JC, Biller J.

    "text": "Complex Central Origin Gait Disorders\nComplex gait disorders of central origin are less well characterized than the ones previously described. Nonetheless, they are probably more common, particularly in the elderly population. In some cases, they are caused by lesions of brainstem nuclei. Some others are due to damage of the control loop that begins in the paracentral cortex and PMC and projects to the putamen. Through direct and indirect pathways, modified by input from the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus, the putamen projects to the medial globus pallidus, which inhibits the activity of thalamic neurons in the ventrolateral and ventral anterior nuclei. These thalamic nuclei send facilitatory projections to the frontal cortex. This loop probably plays an important role in mediating overlearned, unconscious motor activity that runs in the background, such as gait and postural reflexes. Patients with lesions in this loop can markedly improve their gait by paying attention to it. They have a faulty “automatic pilot” for postural reflexes. Finally, other gait disorders result from direct dysfunction of the cortex in the posterior portion of the medial frontal region.\n\nCautious Gait"

    "text": "“It is not possible, however, to exclude all influence of the nuclear genome in the suppression of tumorigenicity. Saxon and co-workers showed that the microcell transfer of Chromosome 11 suppressed tumorigenicity in HeLa cells (Saxon et al., 1986). They suggested that a tumor suppressor gene could be present on Chromosome 11. These findings also suggest an interaction between Chromosome 11 and mitochondria (Seyfried, 2012d). Is it possible that a gene on Chromosome 11 facilitates mitochondrial respiration thus suppressing tumorigenicity in the HeLa cells? (Seyfried, 2012d). It is also interesting that defects on Chromosome 11 have been associated with the Wilms kidney tumor and with childhood neuroblastoma. Further studies will be needed to determine if tumorigenic suppression involves interactions between mitochondrial respiration and genes on Chromosome 11.”1.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Seyfried TN.

    "text": "Keys and Focus\n“Proper leg position is typically a challenge on active range. Quadriceps activation is a good marker for full leg contact. The opposite to leg range limits is excessive range and/or the ability to do the splits in the sitting support position. Remember the goal of leg position is a standard”V” leg position, not “wider the better”. the 2nd goal is getting the trunk flat against the wall. Activating the trunk includes squeezing the abdomen and shoulder blades to create as much contact with the wall throughout the trunk and not letting one region compensate for the other. Abdomen setting for stabilization is not mimicking a crunch, but a combination squeezing the entire abdominal wall into an active lower trunk, while maintaining a vertical pelvis. Using chin tucks to level out the head position and center the head over the torso will assist in achiving postural goals. Mastery of wall sit technique is not a single session goal but a process over time and requires assessment and proper cueing for success.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranslation\n\n\n\n“Although wall sitting is a great warm-up tool and assessment for hip hinge alignment, it is not typically a functional position, but does provide sitting posture cueing. Any feedback to the individual for finding recruitment and working on postural adjustments is a benefit. Use each verbal cue and adjustment as alignment between you and the client. Understand pelvic adjustments without the floor or wall will be harder to feel spatially, any previous discussions or adjustments might come in handy”1"

    "text": "Hemodynamic Effects\n\nInitial Bloow Flow Decrease\nCold application results decreased blood flow due to vasoconstriction which can persist for up to 15-20 minutes1. Cold temperature directly causes vaosoconstriction by activating cutaneous cold receptors, which stimulate the smooth muscles in the blood vessels1. Indirectly, cold application indirectly cause vasoconstriction by decreasing the production and release of mediators of vasodilation (histamines, prostaglandins, etc) and cause reflexive activation of sympathetic adrenergic neurons which causes vasoconstriction1. Lastly, cold application is theorizied to increase blood viscocity, which increases resistance to flow, therefore decreasing circulatory rate1. The combination of direct vasoconstriction, vasodilator reduction, sympathetic adrenergic activation, and increase in blood viscosity all result in a reduction of blood flow1.\n\n\nLater Blood Flow Increase\nCold-Induced Vasodilation (CIVD) refers to vasodilation following exposure to cold for long periods of time or when tissue temperatures reach &lt;10°C (50°F)1."

    "text": "The 3dimensional calf stretch is an exercise inspired by the Gray Institute1.\nStart in a split stance facing a wall with heels on the ground. The rear leg is considered “ipsilateral” since this side will experience the calf stretch and its knee should stay more extended. The lead leg will be the contralateral leg and the knee will be slightly bent.\nInternally rotate the ipsilateral leg so the toes are pointing medially.\nNext we will perform 3 sets of movements to stretch the calf in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes.\n\nSagittal plane\nThe calf can be stretched in the sagittal plane by stepping forwards and backwards with the contralateral leg. Stepping forward will result in hip extension of the ipsilateral side and dorsiflexion (if the heel stays on the ground).\nStepping backwards with the contralateral leg will move the ipsilateral hip into flexion and move the ipsilateral foot into more plantarflexion.\n\n\nFrontal plane\nStart with the contralateral leg forward. Step medially with the contralateral leg, to create ipsilateral hip adduction and ipsilateral ankle eversion. Step laterally with the contralateral leg to create ipsilateral hip abduction and ipsilateral ankle inversion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSince the contralateral leg is in the “lead” or anterior, this will cause the ipsilateral (rear) lower extremity to remain in dorsiflexion throughout the movement.\n\n\n\n\nTransverse plane\nMove the contralateral leg forward, medial, and rotate the foot medially to create ipsilateral hip internal rotation and therefore relative TFJ IR. Move the contralateral leg posterior, lateral, and rotate the foot laterally to create relative ipsilateral hip ER and relative ipsilateral TFJ ER.\n\n\nProgressions\nYou can use the ipsilateral knee as a driver to start, but can progress to using the contralateral leg as a driver to make it more difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.
