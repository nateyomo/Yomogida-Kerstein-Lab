    "text": "What is the Archive?\nThe Archive is a website designed by Nathaniel Yomogida and Chloë Kerstein as a way to take notes in PT school and use these notes as a reference in the future.\n\n\nWhere should I start?\nThe purpose of this website is to create a resource where you can begin reading one topic and it will give you many pathways to similar articles or concepts. This is designed to help build connections and relationships to other areas of biology.\n\n\nCan I view this on my device?\nUsing the website online is the standard way to use this resource. However, some apps such as “SiteSucker” or “Offline pages” may allow you to download the entire website for offline use. It should be noted that the downloaded version of the website may become outdated."
