No difference between groups by day 28. Number of capillaries per fiber and the number of capillaries per mm^2 at 28 day post injury did not differ between groups Day 7: centrally nucleated regenerating mm fibers present in sham, only a few in icing group Percentage of regenerating fibers relative to number of fibers was greater in the icing group than in sham 28 d post injury and no difference at 7 days.\nAnswer: Compared to sham, Icing attenuated and/or delayed neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, expression of vWF, VEGF and nestin, and change in vessel volume within muscle 7 days after injury. Icing did not influence capillary density in mm 28 days post injury. The percentage of immature myofibers relative to the total number of fibers was greater in the icing group than sham 28 d after injury.

    "text": "2.2 Timing\n\nLook for small wedging end sections\nLike a waist/chest high wave with a nice little waist high wedge launch ramp.\n\nYou need a wave that will let you get a few pumps for speed, then is vertical enough to actually let you launch up and out over it, not a mushy wall that’s really slopey. If you need to stall up and wait for the section to start closing out. If you watch pros they’ll frequently stomp the tail and wait for the wave to wall up more, then pump down the line a few times before launching off the lip.\nAs far as how long it takes, it just depends on the person and I think more importantly age. I learned to surf around 8-10 and didn’t learn to do a real air until 8th grade. So however long that is was my time taken. Im 30 now and still trying to learn how to do new grabs and rotations. Also, I think as a kid its a bit easier as you are trying to one up all your friends etc and have 8hr surf days and endless energy haha."

You don’t need super long waves, you just need the right section that throws a nice lip and you need to time it right. I’d recommend practicing stalling up high on the wave next to the white water while you wait for the close out section to stand up, then pump and get some speed and hit the lip at the right time and you’ll do an air. It’s all about timing. You want the lip to hit you forward toward the beach so you don’t go out the back of the wave. Having a super light board will help too because it’s very quick and lighter so it will go in the air easier."

    "text": "4.1 Sensory Pathway\n\n\n\nTrigeminal Sensory System Nuclei and Pathways (from Blumenfeld figure 12.81)\n\n\n\nSomatosensory afferent nerves convey crude touch, pain, and temperature sensation from the face and mouth to the lateral pons1.\nThese nerve fibers then descend the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the spinal trigeminal nucleus1.\n. Similarly, the spinal trigeminal tract is analogous to Lissauer’s tract (see Figures 6.4 and 7.2). Secondary sensory neurons from the spinal trigeminal nucleus cross the brainstem to ascend as the trigeminothalamic tract (or ventral trigeminothalamic tract). The trigeminothalamic tract is analogous to the spinothalamic tract (see Table 12.6), and the pathways travel together to the thalamus (see Figures 12.8 and 14.3). Trigeminothalamic tract fibers synapse in the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), and tertiary sensory neurons then travel in the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex. Like the anterolateral systems in the spinal cord, there are also pathways from the spinal trigeminal nucleus to intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the reticular formation, and other areas, to mediate the affective and arousal aspects of facial pain.\n\nIn summary, it is generally believed that sensory fibers involved in the conduction of pain and temperature spread over the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and then cross over to the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex4"

    "text": "Episodic or intermittent occurrences of pain, with each episode lasting for a relatively short period of time but recurring across an extended period of time (e.g., migraine headaches, tic douloureux, sickle cell crisis, dysmenorrhea). Our distinction between acute and chronic pain using the integration of the dimensions of time and pathology does not specifically include recurrent pain. In the case of recurrent pain, patients may experience episodes of pain interspersed with periods of being completely pain-free. Although recurrent pain may seem acute because each pain episode (e.g., headache) is of relatively short duration, the pathophysiology of many recurrent pain disorders (e.g., migraine) is not well understood. Syndromes characterized by recurrent acute pain share features in common with both acute and chronic pain. The fact that these syndromes extend over time, however, suggests that psychosocial and behavioral factors, not only physical pathology, may be major contributors to emotional and behavioral responses. IASP4 now includes recurrent pain lasting longer than 3 months within its definition of chronic pain. However, it is not clear whether multiple episodes lasting several days within 3 months would meet the chronic pain criterion or whether the pain must last at least 3 months. That is, would multiple migraines in a 3-month period be chronic even if there were pain-free periods within the 3 month period?1\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1. Ballantyne J, Fishman S, Rathmell JP, eds.

    "text": "1 Definition\nPain associated with cancer includes pain associated with disease progression as well as treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) that may damage the nervous system. Although some contend that pain associated with neoplastic disease is unique, in the majority of instances, we view it as fitting within our description of acute and chronic pain, as depicted in Figure 2.1. Moreover, pain associated with cancer can have multiple causes, namely, disease progression, treatment, and co-occurring diseases (e.g., arthritis). Regardless of whether the pain associated with cancer stems from disease progression, treatment, or a cooccurring disease, it may be either acute or chronic. Thus, we do not advocate a separate classification of cancer pain as distinct from acute and chronic pain. Some concerns have also been raised regarding the common usage of chronic malignant and chronic benign pain4; often, pain unrelated to cancer is implicitly view as “benign” to distinguish it from cancer-related pain. Certainly, people who have pain associated with neoplastic disease experience a unique and disease-specific situation, but from a mechanistic perspective, there may be little to substantiate continued use of this dichotomy. Moreover, patients who have chronic noncancer pain who are told that their pain is “benign” may feel denigrated because, from their perspective, the inference is that their pain is not a serious concern.1\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "In human skin, for example, there exist nociceptors that respond only to mechanical, only to cold thermal, or only to hot thermal stimuli as well as those that are insensitive to both mechanical and heat stimuli (mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors)1\nThe most abundant is the polymodal nociceptor, which responds to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. In general, nociceptors that innervate skin have the broadest range of modality selectivity1\nnociceptors innervating deeper structures tend to be less modality-selective and more polymodal in character. For example, mechanical sensitivity is a prominent feature of visceral and joint nociceptors because stimuli adequate for their activation include hollow organ distension and overrotation, respectively1.\nMany of these nociceptors also respond to chemical and/or thermal stimuli as well, although the functional significance of thermal sensitivity in deep tissues is uncertain1.\nAn important characteristic of polymodal nociceptors, whether the modalities of stimulation to which they respond are two or all three, is that when sensitized (e.g., by an inflammatory insult), responses to the other modality or modalities of stimuli to which it responds are all increased\n\n1 Mechanosensitivity\nNociceptors with low mechanical thresholds for response and those with very high mechanical thresholds for response (i.e., sleeping nociceptors) are both clinically important.\nMechanosensitive sensory neurons with low thresholds for response have long been classified as “non-nociceptors” (because it was considered that nociceptors had to have response thresholds in the noxious range)1.\nSome mechanosensitive skin, joint, and many visceral sensory neurons have low thresholds for response (i.e., in the nonnoxious range) but possess characteristics that suggest an important role in pain.\n\nFirst: these low-threshold receptors encode stimulus intensity well into the noxious range and, moreover, typically give greater responses to all intensities of stimulation than do nociceptors with high mechanical thresholds for response1.\nSecond: they sensitize after tissue insult. Unlike nociceptors with low mechanical thresholds, mechanically insensitive or sleeping nociceptors normally provide no information to the central nervous system but after tissue insult become spontaneously active and mechanosensitive1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "3.1 Single leg bridge\nOne can recruit the multifidus muscle by having a patient perform a single leg bridge. In this exercise, one will have a leg on the ground (stance leg) and another leg in the air. Both shoulders will remain on the ground the whole time. As an example, we will imagine an individual using their R leg as the stance leg. Since both shoulders are stationary, the weight of the pelvis and raised leg (L) will add a load d/t gravity that pulls the L hip towards the ground, resulting in relative right rotation. Thus, in order to keep the pelvis level, one must perform active left rotation using the R multifidus since the multifidi perform C/L rotation unilaterally. An easy way to remember which multifid you are recruiting during S/L bridge is that the multifidi on the same side as the stance leg is being recruited."

Genetic studies of individuals with adult-onset FALS have determined that about 20% of these individuals have mutations in SOD1; however, the primary gene defect is unknown. When the SOD enzyme activity is decreased, as has been observed in individuals with FALS with SOD1 mutations, free radicals may accumulate causing damage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Pathological implications\n\n1.

The patient received natural and synthetic antibiotics and steroids to resolve the acute signs of infection, but this did not yield any functional improvement2. Rongies et al., found full and rapid resolution of extraocular paralysis and diploplia using periorbital hydrocortisone iontophoresis, visuomotor exercises combined with intense ideomotor stimulation2.\nInterventions\n\nIontophoresis\n\nIontophoretic treatment of various ophthalmic conditions2.\nUsed as a means of noninvasive, transdermal drug delivery\nPerformed in the orbital region affected by extraocular muscle palsy ( The selected technique of ocular iontophoresis was indirect, through a closed eyelid)2.\nDrug: Corhydron 100 [hydrocortisone] at 50 mg/5mL of a sodium chloride solution as a solvent2.\nThe procedure used direct (or galvanic) current.\nDuration of each single iontophoresis procedure was 20 minutes2\nPt position: Upright sitting position with head and forearms supported (to enable observation of autonomic nervous system related adverse effects)2.\n\nExercise\n\nExercise performed immediately after iontophoresis2.\n30-minute set of PT supervised exercises2.\nBreaks\n\nAllowed if: 1. Pt reported feeling of muscle fatigue or 2. distinct deceleration of eyeball movements was observed\nFrequency of breaks: gradually decreased from every several seconds to every 2 minutes\n\nExercise Type: Attempts to follow with the gaze an object (patient’s hand) moving diagonally in space (in alternate pattern), with additional simultaneous ideomotor stimulation2.\nThe amplitude of movement progressively increased during the rehabilitation sessions. The patient performed his exercises in sitting and standing positions positions which improved comfort by avoiding forced position. His head was still. Each exercise session was conducted in setting that limited the patient’s distraction. The patient was advised to perform these exercises at home 2-3 times a day. The outcome measures for this study were the range of eye movement, reaction times during eye movement and muscle endurance, in comparison with these in the unaffected eye. The results were evaluated visually by 3 independent researchers who were not involved in the process of treatment. The range of movement improvement has been documented in the picture.\n\nResults:\n\nRongies used daily physical therapy and the patient regained distinct movement within 4 days2.\nBy session 16, the patient displayed complete return of function in all paralyzed muscles2."

You should avoid Grade V mobilizations (HVLAT)1. One should introduce the application of incrementally greater movements and loads or investigate VA flow using Doppler sonography or an magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) scan before performing a grade V technique in the cervical spine1. The clinician should consider avoiding placing the patient’s cervical spine in the extremes of rotation and side bending in both the examination and the subsequent intervention, which would obviate the need for these tests1."

    "text": "1 Overview\nHere are historical and current theories of child development. Dynamic systems theory is common in pediatirc physical therapy. Neuronal group selection theory is the most common in physical therapy in general. It should be noted that none of these theories are correct.\n\n\n2 Neuromaturational Theory\n\nDevelopment follows a set, invariant sequence1.\nDevelopment is tightly tied to central nervous system development1.\nMotor development is cephalocaudal and proximal to distal1.\nRecent modifications acknowledge variations in the sequence and input from all systems1.\n\nMcGraw & Gesell were the main proponents of the original theory, which consisted of a step type sequence of development and intervention, Not totally linear, but more or less linear\nThere is a Newer version of theory; can you adapt /change pattern CNS maturation drives development Normal sequence / hierarchy of skill development Classic developmental scales based on this work Importance of developmental reflexes and stepwise sequence of development in intervention\nGessell She says: As you start to master one skill, and u introduce the other skill, u may see a regression is previous skill or new skill wont look perfect Development happens in a proximal to distal sequence, motor skills develop gross to fine Development is dynamic and characterized by alternating advancement and regression Crawling: initial symmetrical arm pattern, then alternates UE Regression to earlier patterns as more mature version occurs\n\n\n3 Cognitive Theory\n•Thinkingdevelopsinstagesofincreasingcomplexity. • Children organize mental schemes through the use of mental operations2.\nPiaget: cognitive development theory\n\n4 stages of cognitive development (inc complexity)\n\nSensorimotor stage (0-2 years): reflex activity leads to purposeful mvmt\nPre operational stage (2-7) : unidimensional awareness of environment\nConcrete operational stage (7-11) less egocentric, solve concrete probs\nFormal operational stage (11+): solve abstract probs, deductive reasoning\nChild’s active involvement in environment (not just neuromaturation) critical to infant development\n\nScaffolding: parents/therapists provide environmental challenge that encourages a child to perform higher level skill\nSome EC programs based on this\n\nMontessori: uses cognitive and developmental theories\n\nChild given freedom to interact and engage in environment and self select activities from specialized materials\n\nReggio emilia: investigatory and exploratory environment helps with problem solving skills\n\n\n\n\n4 Behavioral Theory\n\nMain proponent: Pavlov\nStimulus/response approach\nModify behavior thru manipulating stimuli\nModifying parameters such as intensity/freq/etc\n\nABA- application of behavioral theory\nGet a reward for a desired action\n\nAssumes most behaviors are learned responses\nPositive and negative reinforcements\n\n\n\n5 Dynamic Systems Theory\n\nCommonly used theory in pediatric PT\nMain proponents: Shumway-Cooke, Thelen, Herriza, woolacott\nEmphasis on process rather than product\nResults of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors, cooperation of systems\nDevelopment is nonlinear\nMvmt occurs based on child’s internal factors/ motivators, external environmental dn motor task to be completed\nHow u do it more important than outcomes\nprocess&gt; product\n\n\n\n6 Neuronal Group Selection Theory\n\nCNS influence on development\nBrain organized into population of cells (units) containing individually variable networks (neuronal groups)\nstructure / function of these groups influenced by evolution, environment, behavior\nLike DST , development is non linear BUT GENETICS is as important as experience to shape development\nInterplay between neuroanatomy adn experience form maps that connect neuronal groups\n\nDynamic systems = most common in PT\n\n\n7 Developmental Direction\n\nReflexive to cortical: we start off w reflexive mvmts and we generally are able to override as we age\nProx to distal\nExtensor control to flexor control\nGeneralized to localized (gross motor to fine)\nMedial to lateral\nOpen to closed chain (mobility to stability)\nAsymmetric to symmetric development (super important in children, if u see asymmetrical things happening, it should be a yellow flag!!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Locomotor training using partial body weight support, a treadmill, and early assisted limb movements has also been shown to promote function induced recovery (see Chapter 10: Interventions to Improve Locomotor Skills and Case Study 3) The elements essential for success with these interventions are that (1) practice is task specific and (2) practice is intense, with steady increases in duration and frequency. For example, in CIMT, the patient with stroke practices grasping and manipulating objects during daily tasks using the more affected UE 4 to 6 hours per day, every day. The less-affected UE may be constrained with a mitt, thereby preventing all attempts at compensatory movements."

During landing tasks, athletes aim to move through the greatest available range of joint motion in order to dampen the impact forces they experience27. This is typically characterised by athletes displaying a plantar flexed ankle at initial ground contact to enable the largest possible range of ankle joint motion during the subsequent landing thereby increasing the time over which the impact forces are absorbed\nResults of the present study, however, have shown that landing an aerial with the lead (front) ankle in a dorsiflexed position at initial board-wave contact, rather than a plantar flexed position, was significantly associated with a successful landing\nExplanation: This apparently contradictory finding can be explained by the need for a surfer to maintain contact with their surfboard throughout the final stages of the airborne phase and into the landing phase of the aerial manoeuvre 1\n\n\n4.1.2 Rear ankle\n During the airborne phase, plantar flexion of the rear ankle would result in downward movement of the surfboard tail. As there is a need to maintain constant contact with the surfboard, this downward movement of the surfboard tail would assist in keeping the nose of the surfboard up, leaving the lead ankle in a dorsiflexed position 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRear ankle coupled movements\n\n\n\n“Dorsiflexing the ankle is also likely to be coupled with knee flexion, which would ensure the surfer’s total body centre of mass remains within their base of support, as well as over the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard”1\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Base of Support\n A wider base of support enhances stability when performing a discrete skill, and was also evident when landing aerials in surfing. A wide base of support provides a greater area over which a surfer’s total body centre of gravity can travel before generating a perturbing torque. This increased tolerance for error is particularly useful when trying to land on a largely unpredictable surface such as a wave. A wide stance also helps the surfer position their centre of mass closer to the centre of buoyance of the surfboard, as discussed below (see Critical Feature (iii)) 1\n\n\n4.1.4 Center of Mass (COM)\nThe third clinical feature described by Forsyth (2018) was “Landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard”1\n was Due to the relative unpredictability of surfing and the open nature of a surfing environment, ensuring a surfer lands over the centre of their surfboard is essential to limit the effect of any unexpected perturbations, which might occur because of the changing water surface. Positioning the total body centre of mass directly above the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard reduces the potential to generate any destabilising torques31 during landing. The effect of not adhering to this critical feature was evident in the FS Air Reverse when athletes landed with their total body centre of mass over the nose of the surfboard, which was significantly associated with unsuccessful performance of the manoeuvre (see Table 4). 1"

One should introduce the application of incrementally greater movements and loads or investigate VA flow using Doppler sonography or an magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA) scan before performing a grade V technique in the cervical spine1. The clinician should consider avoiding placing the patient’s cervical spine in the extremes of rotation and side bending in both the examination and the subsequent intervention, which would obviate the need for these tests1."

    "text": "3.2 What if I still want to perform a cervical mobilization?\nFirst, you should opt for a grade I-IV mob rather than a grade V thrust technique1. One should follow the Australian Physiotherapy Association’s Protocol for Premanipulative Testing of the Cervical Spine (although this cannot be viewed as a prescriptive guideline)1.\n\nAustralian Physiotherapy Association’s Protocol recommends that the clinician should maintain the immediate premobilization position for &gt;=10sec to test the patency of the vertebrobasilar system1.\nClinical testing for VBI should stop once (+) signs or symptoms are noted1.\nThroughout the tests, one should observe for possible nystagmus or changes in pupil size and should have the patient count backward to assess his or her quality of speech1.\nThe patient should be instructed to report any changes in symptoms (even seemingly insignificant changes)1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe sensitivity of these premanipulative protocols are unclear1. Multiple studies have found these protocols to have a poor prediction values1."
