# Mechanism

"These are likely underpinned by the numerous bioactive components identified within the mycelia and fruiting bodies of H. erinaceus, including polysaccharides, phenolic acids and terpenoids, specifically hericenones and erinacines [6,9]. Interestingly, both hericenones and erinacines can easily cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier [10]; promote nerve growth factor synthesis and secretion [11,12]; and, in animal models, have been shown to exert anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties and promising cognition-enhancing effects" @dochertyAcuteChronicEffects2023

"Additionally, an increase in circulating pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been observed following hericene A (isolated from H. erinaceus) administration in mice [18]." @dochertyAcuteChronicEffects2023
