# CTJ HVLAT: From SDSU DPT

## Technique

- Pt position: prone
- Head turned towards you + extension
    - “Look up at your wrist”
- Ipsilateral arm above patient’s head
- C/L arm: Can be at side or above head as well
- Clinician:
    - Ipsilateral (hand close to pt) hand on side of (T1?) lateral shifting towards clinician
    - Grab muscle tissue with this hand → allows you to feel how their neck responds
    - Far hand (hand further from pt) placed on:
        - patient’s temple: for SB
        - parietal/occipital bone: More rotation
- Movement
    - Can be more SB or more rotation
    - It just depends where they are locking
    - Tips for relaxing the patient
        - Take them in and out of the position
        - Do the mobilization instead
