# Calculation

Percent agreement equation @gisevInterraterAgreementInterrater2013
$$
 \textrm{Percent Agreement} = \frac{\sigma_s^2}{\sigma_s^2 + \sigma_e^2} = \frac{\textrm{Number of concordant responses} }{\textrm{Total number of responses}}\times 100\%
$$ 


# Scoring

Values range from 0.00 (not reliable) to 1.00 (perfectly reliable) 

| Score | Reliability |
|-|-|
| 0.00 – 0.20 | Poor |
| 0.21 – 0.40 | Fair |
| 0.41 – 0.60 | Moderate |
| 0.61 – 0.80 | Good |
