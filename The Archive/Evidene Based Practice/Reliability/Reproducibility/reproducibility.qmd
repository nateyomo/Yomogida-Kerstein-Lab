:::{.callout-note}
Reproducibility covers many overlapping concepts.

It is explicitly defined as the variation of the same measurement made on a subject under *changing* conditions @buntingPracticalGuideAssess2019

In real-life practice it also includes changes in:

- measurement method
- observer (inter-rater reliability)
- Time frame
- Instrumentation
- Location
- Environment
