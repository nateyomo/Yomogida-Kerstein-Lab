- Coefficient Alpha (&alpha;)
:::


- Cronbach’s alpha (α) is a measure of the [internal consistency]({{< var ref-reliability.internal-consistency >}}) of multiple items or questions within a single survey
- Used for surveys/questionnaires

# Scoring

Values range from 0.00 (not reliable) to 1.00 (perfectly reliable) 

| Score | Reliability |
|-|-|
| 0.00 – 0.20 | Poor |
| 0.21 – 0.40 | Fair |
| 0.41 – 0.60 | Moderate |
| 0.61 – 0.80 | Good |
| 0.81 – 1.00 | Excellent |

# Interpretation

- You want internal consistency results (i.e. [Cronbach's Alpha (&alpha;)]({{< var ref-reliability.cronbachs-alpha >}})) to be high, we do not want it to be too high.
- An (&alpha;) greater than about 0.90 may indicate unnecessary redundancy among the items and means that some of them can be eliminated without jeopardizing the reliability of the scale.
