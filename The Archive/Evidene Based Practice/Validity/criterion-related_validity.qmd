title: Criterion-Related Validity
---



"Criterion-relatedvalidity is the type of validity that frequently underpins quantitative research" @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993.

If the instrument gives an accurate representation of the concept or variable, criterion-related validity has been demonstrated.

There are 3 types of Criterion-related validity:

1. Concurrent validity @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993
1. Predictive validity @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993
1. Prescriptive validity @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993

# Calculation
Evidence for criterion-related validity is obtained by comparing the readings or measurements obtained by the investigator with a measurable criterion that is accepted as a standard indicator of a concept or variable @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993.
