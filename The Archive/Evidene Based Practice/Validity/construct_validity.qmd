title: Construct Validity
---



how well a test measures the concept it was designed to evaluate.

# Assessing Construct Validity

- Identify the constructs and their operational definitions
    - What is the abstract characteristic or concept being measured (construct)?
    - What methods are used to define and or measure this construct (operational definition) 
- Is the operational definition a reasonable/clinically meaningful reflection of the construct?
    - Does the operational definition adequately represent the construct
    - Are the construct and its operational definition a good match for my PICO question and meaningful for my pt? (External validity)
