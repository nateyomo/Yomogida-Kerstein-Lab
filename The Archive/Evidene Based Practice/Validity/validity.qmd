"In order to improve validity, attempts must be made primarily to remove systematic error, or bias" @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993

| Validity | [Reliability]({{< var ref-reliability.path >}}) |
|-|-|
| Deals with the accuracy ofinferences made from measurements @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 | Deals with the reproducibility of measurements themselves @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 |
|Concerns the relationship between the measurement and the entity being measured @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 | Is a property ofthe measurement (and the person performing it) |
| Requires independent knowledge ofthe "true" value of the entity being measured @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 | Is not dependent on the "true" value ofthe entity being measured @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 |
| Presupposes a certain degree of reliability @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 | Does not presuppose validity @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 |
| Is undermined by [systematic error]({{< var ref-error.systematic >}}) @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 | Is undermined by [random error]({{< var ref-error.random >}}) @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 |
| Liable, if lacking, to distort or bias relationships among variables @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 | Liable, if lacking, to obscure relationships among variables @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993 |

# Types of Validity



There are 2 broad types of validity: External and Internal validity @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

### Internal Validity
[Internal validity]({{< var ref-validity.internal >}}) refers to the possibility that the the conclusions drawn from the results of the study accurately reflect the experiment itself @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993.

Includes:

- [Construct validity]({{< var ref-validity.construct >}}): Does the study design correctly answer its research question?
- [Statistical Conclusion validity]({{< var ref-validity.statistical-conclusion >}}): Were the correct statistical tests used and were they interpreted correctly?

### External Validity

External validity refers to how successfuly one can apply the results of a study on a sample can be generalized to a particular population @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993.

Face validity is often identified with content validity since is less applicable to formal scientific testing @simMeasurementValidityPhysical1993.
