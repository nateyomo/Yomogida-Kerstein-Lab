title: Grand Mean
---

Grand mean is the mean of all observations: every data point, divided by the joint sample size.


# Calculation


:::{.callout-tip}
If all the subsamples have the same number of points, the grand mean is simply a mean of the subsample means.

# Example

- Sample 1: (6, 6, 3, 3)
- Sample 2: (1, 5, 0, 14)
- Sample 3: (9, 10, 11, 12)
- Sample 4: (0, 4, 0, 20)

Step 1: Find the sample means of each group:
(4.5, 5, 10.5, 6).

Step 2: Take the mean of the results from Step 1:
(4.5, 5, 10.5, 6) / 4 = 26 / 4 = 6.5.
