title: Mixed Analysis of Variance (Mixed ANOVA)
---

- AKA
    - Split-plot ANOVAs
    - Mixed factorial ANOVAs
    - Mixed design ANOVAs

Mixed Analysis ANOVA uses 2 factors for comparison

1. A between group factor
1. A within group factor

# Calculation

F Ratio

- MSB: Mean Squares Between
- MSW: Mean Square Within

$$
\textrm{F-Ratio} = \frac{MSB}{MSW}
$$


# Interpretation


- F-Ratio: The ratio of those two MS values
    - "If the null hypothesis were correct, each MS value would estimate the variance among values, so the two MS values would be similar" @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018
    - If the null hypothesis is true, F-ratio would be close to 1 @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018
    - If null hypothesis is false, F-Ratio should be greater than 1
