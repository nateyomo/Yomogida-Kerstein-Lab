A testing effect is the result of a problem with the experimental setup that will create a systematic error in one group and not the other.

For tests without control groups, repeated testing that may influence test outcomes regardless of the intervention such as learning or fatigue

:::{.callout title="Example"}

- A study designed to measure shoulder strength following an intervention
- The experimental group receives 3 warm‚Äêup trials prior to testing but the control group does not
- The warmup is not part of the intervention, and therefore creates a testing effect that will overestimate tx effects due to improved performance following the practice/warmup trials
