title: Maturation Bias
---

Maturation bias refers to systematic error created by the lack of a control group.

Maturation bias is likely to overestimate treatment effects.

:::{.callout title="Example"}

- Single‐group study design concludes that a 4‐week PT intervention is effective based on significant improvements in shoulder disability after treatment compared to before treatment.
- This is an example of maturation bias, and the researchers do not know how much of the healing is from the intervention or normal healing.
- This is likely to overestimate treatment effects due to the absence of a control group. That might have healed fully or partially on their own without treatment

# Prevention

Maturation effects can be ruled out using a control group.
