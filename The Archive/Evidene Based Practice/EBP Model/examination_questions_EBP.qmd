title: Evidence based Examination 
subtitle: Using evidence to guide your examination
---

Within one's examination we want to select diagnostic tests/outcome measures to:

- Rule in/out a diagnosis
- Reliably measure severity of impairment, functional limitation, or disability
- Detect meaningful change (for goal setting) 
- Accurately determine prognosis

# Optimal study design

When searching for studies to answer your clinical question, study design depends on type of psychometric property evaluated

:::{.callout-tip title="Search helper"}
Use the term for the psychometric property itself instead of using search terms for study design
:::




# Rule in / Rule out
Diagnostic validity
Diagnostic accuracy, etc

# Reliably measure severity


# Detect meaningful change
Detect clinically meaningful chane over time for goal setting

# Prognosis

To determine prognosis, cliniciancs should find a reliable indicator to measure prognosis
