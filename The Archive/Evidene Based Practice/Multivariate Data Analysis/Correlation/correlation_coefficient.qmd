title: Correlation Coefficient (r)
subtitle: Strength of association between different ratings of the same thing
---

Correlation coefficient (r) reflects the Direction and magnitude of linear association between variables

Limitations:

- Only gives info on How closely associated the numbers are (if one increases or decreases, the other does as well)
- Does NOT give info on how well those actual values agree (level of agreement?)



# Scoring

# Interpretation



Direction (regardless of magnitude):

- Positive correlation (+r): as one variable increases, the other variable increases
- Negative correlation (‚Äêr): as one variable increases, the other variable decreases
    - AKA inverse correlation

Magnitude (regardless of direction):

- (r) values range from: 0.00 (no association) to 1.00 (perfect association)
- The closer (r) is to 1.00, the stronger the association between variables
