# Linear regression vs Pearson product vs Spearman rank coefficient

![Comparison of differing "r" and "$\rho$" values (From figure 3 of Schober et al. 2018 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018)](/The Archive/Evidene Based Practice/Multivariate Data Analysis/images/fig3 schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018.png)



## Linear Regression

Usually when the independent variable is fully controlled @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018

- 1 independent variable (x)
- 1 dependent variable (y)

Purpose: estimation of y-values from x-values


## Pearson Product Moment Correlation (r)

Generally applied when both variables are observed @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018

- 2 continuous random variables

- Purpose: Correlation Coefficient
    - Measure strength of the relationship
    - Conventionally applied when both 


## Spearman Rank Coefficient ($\rho$)

[Read more about Spearman Rank Coefficient ($\rho$)]({{< var ref-spearman-rank-coefficient.path >}})

- 2 Continuous random variables
- 1 variable is ordinal and ranked
    - Converts non-linear to ranked-linear

Purpose: Correlation Coefficient
