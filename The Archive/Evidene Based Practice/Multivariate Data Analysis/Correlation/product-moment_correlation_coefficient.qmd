- Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient (r)
:::

# Purpose
Determine linear relationship between two continuous random variables @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018

Measure: Strength of the linear relationship (Covariance) @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018

- Results in Correlation Coefficient


# Results

The correlation coefficient (r) is the main result of a correlation.
It is computed as the ratio of covariance between the variables to the product of their standard deviations.


# Interpretation

-1 to +1 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018

| Strength | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Negligible | 0.00–0.10 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018 |
| Weak | 0.10–0.39 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018 |
| Moderate | 0.40–0.69 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018 |
| Strong | 0.70–0.89 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018 |
| Very strong | 0.90–1.00 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018 |
| Perfect Correlation | -1 or +1 @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018 |

# Interpretation

Perfect correlation

- -1 or +1
- All the data points lie exactly on the straight line

You should always graph your results to ensure you arent missing correlations that **are not** linear

NOTE: these can be used by researchers to misrepresent data that is not linearly correlated @schoberCorrelationCoefficientsAppropriate2018

Significance


- T-Test?
- P-value = correlation differs significantly from Zero

:::{.callout-warning}
"Many studies give the product–moment correlation coefficient (r) between the results of two measurement methods as an indicator of agreement. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods" @giavarinaUnderstandingBlandAltman2015
