title: Experimenter Bias
---

Experimenter bias can occur if the investigator is not blinded to which group the patient is in, which creates a higher chance that they may consciously or unconsciously influence the patient response during testing.

Experimenter bias can occur for tests involving:

- Particularly concerning for outcome measure that involve
- Subjective judgments by the examiner
- Unstandardized physical performance tests where the investigator can provide more/less instruction or encouragement to change performance
- Surveys given to patients with someone with whom theyâ€™ve developed a relationship during treatment

Same examiner who provided experimental and control treatments also assesses ROM before and after intervention could consciously or subconsciously provide more overpressure.
