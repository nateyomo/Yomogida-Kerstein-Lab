3 categories of databases:

1. Database does most of the appraisal
1. Database performs some appraisal
1. 



# Appraisal Databases
## Full-appraisal Databases 

- Cochrane Library (ONLY intervention studies not prognosis)
- DARE


## Semi-appraisal Databases

- PEDro (only intervention not prognosis studies)
- Hooked on Evidence (requires APTA membership):
- Rehabilitation Measures: developed to help clinicians and researchers identify reliable and valid instruments used to assess patient outcomes during all phases of rehabilitation.


## No-appraisal Databases

- PubMed (most comprehensive database) (prognosis and intervention studies) 
- CINAHL (focuses on nursing and allied health)
- ERIC
- SPORTDiscus (sport, fitness, and sports-med)

# Outcome Measure Databases

- Orthopedic scores: a free outcome measure calculation service for certain orthopaedic OMs
- Patient‚ÄêReported Health Instruments: includes over 16,00 records with keyword search capability.
- StrokeEngine: provides information on outcome measures and interventions related to Stroke.
- The Neurology Section: recommendations for outcome measures used in neurological clinical practice, research and education
- NIH Toolbox: national database of free health measurement tools in multiple domains


# PEDro

[PEDro](https://www.pedro.org.au/)


- Gives you a good idea of what is out there in terms of primary research articles (go to methods: SRs, clinical trials, etc) 
- Developed and maintained by Centre for Evidence-based Physiotherapy (Australia). Updated every 2 weeks
- USEFUL to decide if a study did or did not have high quality evidence (PEDro will give a score; based on randomized control trials etc)  
    - Individual trials are rated on a 0 (low) -10 (high) quality scale. Reviews and practice guidelines not rated. Citations ranked in order of quality score
- Accessibility
    - Provides free citations and reviews of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on physical therapy interventions
- Able to search by:
    - Therapeutic approach
    - Clinical problem
    - Body part
    - Physical therapy subspecialty

PEDro can only be used for intervention studies and not prognosis

# Pubmed / medline

- Developed and maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Updated daily.  
- Free, comprehensive online database of over 20 million basic and applied research citations dating back to the 1950s  
- Provides links to on-line journals that provide full text versions of articles. Full-text articles for all federally funded studies published after April 2008 are provided free to the public 1 year after publication 
- Unlike Google Scholar, PubMed has rigorous quality standards for which journals are included. Not all allied health journals are indexed


# Other resources

- Fermat's Library
- Bioarxive: A library of Pre-print articles (note: these are not peer reviewed or even published)
- ResearchRabbit: An AI helper that assists you to find similar articles
