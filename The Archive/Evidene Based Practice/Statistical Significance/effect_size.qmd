# Overview

- Effect size is a measure of the difference between sample means @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.
- Effect size could be considered "How much something changes *after* a specific intervention" @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.
- Effect size measures the extent to which two samples do **not** overlap @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.
- Often Abbreviated "d" (Cohen's d)

# Types of Effect Size


## Raw Score Effect Size
Raw score effect size provides the literal mean difference between mean group scores @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|-|----|
| $\mu_1$ | Sample 1 mean @aronStatisticsPsychology2013 |
| $\mu_2$ | Sample 2 mean @aronStatisticsPsychology2013
$$
\textrm{Raw Score Effect Size} = \mu_1 - \mu_2
$$

## Standardized Effect Size
The standardized effect size is the raw score effect size divided by the standard deviation of its respective population @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|-|----|
| d | Cohen's D (Effect Size) @aronStatisticsPsychology2013 |
| $\mu_1$ | Sample 1 mean @aronStatisticsPsychology2013 |
| $\mu_2$ | Sample 2 mean @aronStatisticsPsychology2013
| $\sigma$ | Standard Deviation of the Population |

$$
\textrm{d} = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma}
$$

Standardized Effect size allows one to compare effect sizes between different measures.
For example, standardized effect size allows a researcher to compare a pain scale from 0-43 to another pain scale which ranges from 0-10 @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.

::: {.callout-note}

- Notice that you are using standard deviation of the population (&sigma;) **not** standard deviation of the distribution of means ($\sigma_M$) @aronStatisticsPsychology2013
- In addition you are only concerned with *one* population's standard deviation @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.
- In hypothesis testing, all of your participants should be from the same overall population @aronStatisticsPsychology2013.

# Example

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

### Experiment A results:

- Control group mean: 200
- Experimental group mean: **220**
- Raw Score Effect size: $220-200=\textbf{20}$
- Standardized Effect size: $\textrm{d} = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma} =\frac{220-200}{48} = \textbf{0.416}$

### Experiment B Results

- Control group mean: 200
- Experimental group mean: **210**
- Raw Score Effect size: $210-200=\textbf{10}$
- Standardized Effect size:  $\textrm{d} = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma} = \frac{210-200}{48} = \textbf{0.208}$

When comparing these two experiments, we can visually see that Experiment A has a much larger effect size.

# Eta Squared ($\eta^2$)

Eta squared measures the proportion of variance that a given variable accounts for out of the total variance in an ANOVA model. It is calculated as:


$$

\eta^2 = \frac{\textrm{SS}_\textrm{effect}}{(\textrm{SS}_\textrm{total})} 

$$

where:

SSeffect: The sum of squares of an effect for one variable.
SStotal: The total sum of squares in the ANOVA model.
When there is only one predictor variable in the model (i.e. a one-way ANOVA), then the value for eta squared and partial eta squared will be equal.

# Partial Eta Squared ($\eta^2$)


Partial eta squared is a way to measure the effect size of different variables in ANOVA models.

It measures the proportion of variance explained by a given variable of the total variance remaining after accounting for variance explained by other variables in the model.

How to Calculate Partial Eta Squared
The formula to calculate Partial eta squared is as follows:

$$

\textrm{partial} \space \eta^2 = \frac{\textrm{SS}_\textrm{effect}}{(\textrm{SS}_\textrm{effect} + \textrm{SS}_\textrm{error})} 

$$

- $\textrm{SS}_\textrm{effect}$: The sum of squares of an effect for one variable.
- $\textrm{SS}_\textrm{error}$: The sum of squares error in the ANOVA model.

Interpretation

- The value for Partial eta squared ranges from 0 to 1
- Values closer to 1 indicate a higher proportion of variance that can be explained by a given variable in the model after accounting for variance explained by other variables in the model.
- The following rules of thumb are used to interpret values for Partial eta squared:

| $\eta^2$ | Interpretation |
|-|-|
|0.01 | Small effect size |
|0.06 | Medium effect size |
| 0.14 or higher | Large effect size |
