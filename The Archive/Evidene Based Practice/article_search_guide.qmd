# Search Filtering

Goal < 50 abstracts with a search

## PICOS Terms

- Add one term at a time, combined w AND, no long phrases
- Key terms only
- Too many results: add pico terms, more specific pico terms, use filters
- Too few results: remove one or more PICO terms, use less specific PICO terms, search MeSH terms, search for related populations, interventions, outcomes that can be generalized, search alternative databases

## What is a productive Search


1. Phrase question in PICOs format 
1. Identify simple and specific search terms from PICOs question
1. Combine search terms (including synonyms)
1. Search for results
1. Modify (broaden or narrow) search terms based on quality and number of results…search again…  (Goal < 50 abstracts) 
1. Filter results by optimal study design to identify highest quality studies first
1. Select relevant article(s) based on best match with PICOs question:
    - Study design (internal validity) 
    - Population (external validity)
    - Intervention/Indicators and Outcomes (construct/external validity)


# Pubmed search guide

- Quotation marks:
    - No quotations around key terms: Automatically search for related MESH terms
    - Using quotations around key terms: Searches for an exact term or phrase
    - Always use quotation marks when searching with abbreviations or clinical jargon
- Wildcards (*)
    - Use wildcard "*" to truncate search terms
    - "therap*" will search for: therapy, therapist, therapies, therapeutic, etc.


## Pubmed Boolean operators
Linking Terms with boolean operators: AND/OR/NOT

- Must use all caps
- Keep terms simple.  Avoid multiple word phrases!!

Using the "AND" Function:


Using the "OR" Function:
- Parantheses: only required when grouping terms with "OR"

:::{.callout title="Syntax example" collapse="true"}
Improper syntax: "Physical therapy OR rehabilitation AND pain OR function"

Proper syntax: (physical therapy OR rehabilitation) AND (pain OR function) 
:::


Using the "NOT" Function: 


## Keyword vs MeSH Terms

- Keyword: Single term selected by you
    - Not standardized
    - PubMed will search only for the “keyword” (must be in quotes)
    - Useful to narrow down results to a very specific topic
        - “Neck Disability Index”, “NDI”
- MeSH: Medical Subject Heading
    - Standardized vocabulary used by PubMed to determine which keywords will be recognized (default search)
    - PubMed will search for MeSH term and all relevant subheadings within that term
    - Useful to avoid missing relevant articles when there are many synonyms for your search term
