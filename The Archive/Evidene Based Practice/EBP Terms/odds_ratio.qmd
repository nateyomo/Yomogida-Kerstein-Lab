title: Odds Ratio (OR)

- Question: How to compare to Relative risk





# Definition

- Odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure

:::{.callout-tip}
I like to think of odds ratio as the reverse of an RCT

In an RCT, we compare the experimental and control group, which only differ by the independent variable.
Then the results are measured using dependent variables

An odds ratio compares two groups of people who only differ based on exposure.
You could think of exposure as the "independent variable."
When viewing the results, you could view the exposure rates as the "dependent variables."
Thus when comparing the two using an odds ratio, you are trying to ascertain whether the exposure was statistically significant in outcome rates.

Odds ratio (OR):  (see 28613750)

- The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of how strongly an event is associated with exposure. 


- OR = odds that a case was exposed / Odds that a control was exposed

# Practical use:

- Odds ratios commonly are used to report case-control studies

# Calculation



- The odds ratio is a ratio of two sets of odds: the odds of the event occurring in an exposed group versus the odds of the event occurring in a non-exposed group

# Interpretation

- OR < 1: Odds of disease lower with exposed than non-exposed
- OR = 1: No difference in odds of disease
- OR > 1: Odds of disease greater in exposed than non-exposed
