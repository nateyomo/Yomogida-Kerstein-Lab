# Absolute Change

Absolute change (&Delta;y) is the simplest metric with which to assess change @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015. 

$$
\Delta y = y_f - y_i
$$



## Problems

The absolute change (&Delta; y) may depend, in part, on the initial value $y_i$ @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.

### Variation between groups
- If $y_i$ varies substantially **between** groups suppose $y_i$ represents the initial diameter of arteries and arterioles then larger values of &Delta;y are likely to be associated with larger values of $y_i$ @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.

### Variation within groups
- Oppositely, if yi varies **within** a group
- Example: suppose now that $y_i$ represents the initial blood pressure of healthy controls
- For mathematical reasons alone, if $y_i$ is smaller, then $y_f$ can increase more: @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015
    - The lower you start, the higher you can climb.
- If $y_i$ is bigger, then $y_f$ can decrease more:
    - the higher you start, the farther you can fall @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.

## Solution

- 

# Standardized Absolute change

$$
\textrm{Standardized Absolute Change} = \frac{\Delta y}{y_i} = \frac{y_f - y_i}{y_i}
$$

:::{.callout-note}
Often, this ratio is rescaled to [percent change (%&Delta;)](#percent-change-(Î´)), by multiplying by 100 @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015
:::

# Percent Change (%&Delta;)


$$
\textrm{Percent Change} = \textrm{Standardized Absolute Change} \times 100\% = \frac{\Delta y}{y_i} \times 100\%
$$

## Problems

:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### Undefined Results
If the initial value happens to be 0, then the percent change is undefined @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.

### Infinity
And, as yi gets smaller and smaller, %&Delta; gets bigger and bigger, approaching $\infty$ or $1 - \infty$ depending on whether $y_f$ increases or decreases from $y_i$ @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.

### Direction of comparison guides magnitude

### Increasing

- $y_i = 1$
- $y_f = 2$
- $\frac{\Delta y}{y_i} \times 100 \% = \frac{2-1}{1} \times 100 \% = \textbf{100\%}$
- We can conclude that $y_f$ is 100% greater than $y_i$ @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015

### Decreasing

- $y_i = 2$
- $y_f = 1$
- $\frac{\Delta y}{y_i} \times 100 \% = \frac{1 - 2}{2} \times 100 \% = \textbf{50\%}$
- We can conclude that the $y_f$ is 50% less than $y_i$.
:::

We can resolve this logical dissonance using [Symmetrized Percent change](#symmetrized-percent-change)

@curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015 


## Symmetrized Percent Change

Symmetrized %&Delta; is better behaved mathematically than is %&Delta; @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.

$$
\textrm{Symmetrized Percent Change} = \frac{y_f - y_i}{y_f + y_i} \times 100\% = \frac{\Delta y}{y_f + y_i} \times 100\%
$$

- If $y_i$ happens to be 0, then the symmetrized %&Delta; is 100% @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.
- If $y_i$ differs from 0 and $y_f = 0$, then the symmetrized %&Delta; is $-100\%$ @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.
- As with %&Delta;,if $y_f = y_i$, then the symmetrized %&Delta; is 0% @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.
And a pleasing property (24) is that, for some pair of initial and final values, the magnitude of the symmetrized percent change is unaffected by the direction of the comparison @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.

$$
\frac{y_f - y_i}{y_f + y_i} \times 100\% = \frac{2-1}{1+2} \times 100\% = 33\%
$$

$$
\frac{y_f - y_i}{y_f + y_i} \times 100\% = \frac{1-2}{2+1} \times 100\%
$$


## Percent Change vs Symmetrized Percent Change

- These two metrics of relative change purport to account for differences in the initial value @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.
- Similar to other ratios, if there is no relationship between &Delta;y and $y_i$, then the mere calculation of %&Delta; and symmetrized %&Delta; creates a relationship @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.
If there is a relationship between &Delta;y and $y_i$, then the calculation of %&Delta; and symmetrized %&Delta; exaggerates the strength of that relationship @curran-everettAnalysisOfChange2015.
