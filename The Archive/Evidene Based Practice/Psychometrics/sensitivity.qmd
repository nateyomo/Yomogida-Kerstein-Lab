Sensitivity is a psychometric measure that quantifies the rate of true positives to total positives @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021.
Sensitivity can apply to clinical tests that output a binary result: Normal vs Abnormal




# Calculation

Sensitivity quantifies true positive rate by finding the percent of people with disease who tested positive divided by total disease population.

$$
\textrm{Sensitivity} = \frac{(\textrm{True Positive})}{(\textrm{True Positive} + \textrm{False Negative})} = \frac{(\textrm{True Positive})}{(\textrm{Total Positive})}
$$
