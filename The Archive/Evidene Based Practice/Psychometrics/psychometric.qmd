# Understanding Different Psychometrics

## Sensitivity & Reliability
Sensitivity and Reliability are used to assess the performance of an alternative test *against* the gold standard @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021a


## Predictive Values

- PPV and NPV reflect the proportion of positive and negative results that are true positives and true negatives @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021.
- PPV answers the question: "if I have a positive test, what is the probability that I actually have the disease?" @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021
- NPV answers the question: "if I have a negative test, what is the probability that I actually donâ€™t have the disease?" @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021

$$
\textrm{PPV} = \frac{\textrm{True Positives}}{\textrm{Test Positives}} = \frac{\textrm{True Positives}}{\textrm{True Positives} + \textrm{Test Positives}}
$$

$$
\textrm{NPV} = \frac{\textrm{True Negatives}}{\textrm{Test Negatives}} = \frac{\textrm{True Negatives}}{\textrm{True Negatives} + \textrm{Test Negatives}}
$$
