title: Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
---

Answers the question "if the test is negative (normal test result), what is the chance that the patient really doesnâ€™t have the disease?" @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018



# Calculation


$$
\textrm{PPV} = \frac{(\textrm{True negatives})}{(\textrm{All Negatives})} = \frac{A}{A + B}
$$

# Factors

Sensitivity and specificity are properties of the test, whereas positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) are influenced by disease prevalence @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018.
