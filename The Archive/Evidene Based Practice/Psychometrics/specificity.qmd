Negative predictive value reflect the proportion of positive and negative results that are true negatives @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021.
NPV answers the question: "if I have a negative test, what is the probability that I actually donâ€™t have the disease?" @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021


# Clinical Significance

One should use specificity (and sensitivity) as a way to assess the performance of a diagnostic test @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021.
To predict whether a particular person will truly have the disease based on a positive or negative test result, one should use [Positive predicitve value (PPV)]({{< var ref-psychometric.predictive-value.positive >}}) and [Negative predictive value (NPV)]({{< var ref-psychometric.predictive-value.negative >}}) @monaghanFoundationalStatisticalPrinciples2021.
