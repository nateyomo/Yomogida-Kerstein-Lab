# Positive Predictive Values
If the test is positive (abnormal test result, suggesting the presence of disease), what is the chance that the patient really has the disease? @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018


$$
\textrm{PPV} = \frac{\textrm{True Positives}}{\textrm{Test Positives}} = \frac{\textrm{True Positives}}{\textrm{True Positives} + \textrm{Test Positives}}
$$


# Negative Predictive Value
Answers the question "if the test is negative (normal test result), what is the chance that the patient really doesnâ€™t have the disease?" @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018




$$
\textrm{NPV} = \frac{\textrm{True Negatives}}{\textrm{Test Negatives}} = \frac{\textrm{True Negatives}}{\textrm{True Negatives} + \textrm{Test Negatives}}
$$
$$
\textrm{PPV} = \frac{(\textrm{True negatives})}{(\textrm{All Negatives})} = \frac{A}{A + B}
$$


# Factors

Sensitivity and specificity are properties of the test, whereas positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) are influenced by disease prevalence @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018.
