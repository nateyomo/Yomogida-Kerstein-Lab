The ROC curve is a visualization of the trade-off between high sensitivity and high specificity @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018.

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

### Bottom left: 

- An extreme where the test never returns a positive diagnosis. 
- At this extreme, every patient is incorrectly diagnosed as healthy (sensitivity = 0%) @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018 
- Every control is correctly diagnosed as healthy (specificity = 100%) @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018

### Upper right extreme

- The test always returns a diagnosis that the person tested has the disease @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018.
- Every true positive is correctly diagnosed
    - Sensitivity (true positive rate) = 100% @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018
- Every true negative is incorrectly diagnosed as a positive
    - specificity (True negative rate) = 0% @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018
    - False positive rate ($1 - \textbf{specificity}$) = 100% @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018

# What is the best cut-off?

Choosing the ideal cut-off point is dependent on the consequences of a false negative or false positive.

- If both consequences are equally bad: The best threshold is the one that corresponds to the point on the ROC curve that is closest to the upper-left corner of the graph.
- Generally, the consequences are not comparable.
- It will be difficult to decide what cut-off makes the most sense. That decision must be made by someone who understands the disease and the test. It is not a decision to be made by a computer program.

# Bayesian Logic

See Bayesian logic p448 @motulskyIntuitiveBiostatisticsNonmathematical2018

# Area under the Curve (AUC)

See Receiver operating characteristic curve: overview and practical use for clinicians @nahmReceiverOperatingCharacteristic2022 

- ideal ROC curve thus has an AUC = 1.0. @nahmReceiverOperatingCharacteristic2022 
- Therefore, for any diagnostic technique to be meaningful, the AUC must be greater than 0.5
- in general, it must be greater than 0.8 to be considered acceptable

### Confidence Interval
For any test to be statistically significant, the lower 95% CI value of the AUC must be > 0.5

:::

| AUC | Interpretation |
|-|-|
| $0.9 \geq \textrm{AUC}$ | Excellent |
| $0.8 \geq \textrm{AUC} \geq 0.9$ | Good |
| $0.7 \geq \textrm{AUC} \geq 0.8$ | Fair |
| $0.6 \geq \textrm{AUC} \geq 0.7$ | Poor |
| $0.5 \geq \textrm{AUC} \geq 0.6$ | Fail |
| $0.0 \geq \textrm{AUC} \leq 0.5$ | Worse than flipping a coin |

### Automating the decision about which point on an ROC curve to use as a cut-off
The ROC curve plots the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity. Which combination is the best to define a critical value of a lab test? It depends on the consequences of making a false positive or a false negative diagnosis. That decision needs to be made in a clinical (or in some situations, scientific) context and should not be automated.


### Thinking that a single value can quantify the accuracy of a test 
There are many ways to quantify accuracy
