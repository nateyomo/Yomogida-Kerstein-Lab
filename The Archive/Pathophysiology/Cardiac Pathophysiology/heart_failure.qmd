- Severe renal dysfunction
- Kidneys cant filter, heart cant keep up
- Secondary to renal system failure to filter

## Low-output failure

- Heart cannot pump minimum amount to support circulation

## Systolic dysfunction

- Problem with systole or strength of contraction

## Diastolic dysfunction

- Problem with diastole or ability of ventricle to allow filling
