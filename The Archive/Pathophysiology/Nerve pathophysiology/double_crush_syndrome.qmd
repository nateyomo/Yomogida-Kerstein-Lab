In addition, dissatisfactionafter treatment at one site may be the result of persistent pathology at
another site along a peripheral nerve </q>

# Interventions

<q> When a loss of neural mobility is present, neural mobilizations are incorporated in order to improve gliding of the neural tissue in relation to its surroundings and minimize tension and adhesion formation.
These techniques are especially important in cases of a double crush phenomenon. </q> @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a
