title: Musculoskeletal Approach to the shoulder

# Diagnosis


## Considerations before using special tests:

Special tests for the shoulder have multiple issues.

### Poor Gold Standards

- Poor convergent validity: Special tests for the shoulder are based on MRI and ultrasounds, which are poor gold standards @salamhItTimePut2020.

### Poor Tissue Isolation (Specificity)

- In empty can for “ supra” 9 shoulder mm active, 
- During full can test 8 other mm were active

### Pain is unreliable

- Hyperalgesia: Areas with increased inflammatory markers can cause unrelated areas to be sensitive to certain positions.  For example the subacromial bursa has high concentrations of substance P and pro-inflammatory cytokines and is often aggravated by the Empty can test @salamhItTimePut2020.
- Allodynia: Pain is not directly related to tissue damage @salamhItTimePut2020.
