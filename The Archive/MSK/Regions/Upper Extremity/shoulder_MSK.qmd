# Anatomy

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
### 3 Bones

- [Humerus]({{< var ref-humerus-bone.path >}})
- [Clavicle]({{< var ref-clavicle-bone.path >}})
- [Scapula]({{< var ref-scapula-bone.path >}})

### 3 Joints

- [Sternoclavicular (SCJ)]({{< var ref-sternoclavicular-joint.path >}})
- [Acromioclavicular (ACJ)]({{< var ref-acromioclavicular-joint.path >}})
- [Glenohumeral Joint (GHJ)]({{< var ref-glenohumeral-joint.path >}})

### 1 Pseudojoint

The Scapulothoracic Joint is considered a "psuedo joint" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

### 1 Physiologic Area

- Suprahumeral/Subacromial space

# Ligaments


"(GH Ligs) Together with the coracohumeral ligament, these ligaments form a Z-pattern on the anterior aspect of the shoulder (Fig. 16-6).3 In the midrange of rotation, the G-H ligaments are relatively lax" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Stabilization

## Passive

The shoulder maintains its passive stability by using multiple structures arranged reciprocally so when one structure is lax, the other is tightened @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 
This allows the shoulder to have large degrees of freedom and ROM while limiting translation and rotation of the GHJ surfaces @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 

- GH ligaments 
- Capsule
    - Posterior capsule
- Glenoid labrum

## Active

- GHJ
    - RTC
- Shoulder elevation
    - Rhomboids
    - SA

# Bursae

According to Dutton @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020, the *synovium* of the *GH Joint Capsule* forms multiple bursae in shoulder complex @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020. 

- Subacromial bursae (Subdeltoid Bursae) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
    - Lies on the superior aspect of the joint @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
    - Largest bursae of the shoulder complex @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

"It also forms variously sized bursae, the largest of which, the subacromial or subdeltoid bursa, lies on the superior aspect of the joint (see later)." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 

# Biomechanics




# Diagnosis


## Considerations before using special tests:

Special tests for the shoulder have multiple issues.

:::{layout-ncol="3"}

### Poor Gold Standards

- Poor convergent validity: Special tests for the shoulder are based on MRI and ultrasounds, which are poor gold standards @salamhItTimePut2020.

### Poor Tissue Isolation (Specificity)

- In empty can for “ supra” 9 shoulder mm active, 
- During full can test 8 other mm were active

### Pain is unreliable

- Hyperalgesia: Areas with increased inflammatory markers can cause unrelated areas to be sensitive to certain positions.  For example the subacromial bursa has high concentrations of substance P and pro-inflammatory cytokines and is often aggravated by the Empty can test @salamhItTimePut2020.
- Allodynia: Pain is not directly related to tissue damage @salamhItTimePut2020.
