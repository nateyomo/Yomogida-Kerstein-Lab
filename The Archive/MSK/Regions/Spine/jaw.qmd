# Muscle and Joint interaction

The muscle of mastication are divided by size and force potential into two groups: primary and secondary

In addition, mechanoreceptors and sensory nerves from oral mucosa, periodontal ligaments, and muscles provide the nervous system with a rich source of proprioception. This sensory information helps protect the soft oral tissues, such as the tongue and cheeks, from trauma caused by the teeth during chewing or speaking. Furthermore, the sensation helps coordinate the neuromuscular reflexes that synchronize the functional interaction among the muscles of the TMJ and in the craniocervical region. The sensory innervation from the TMJ is carried through two branches of the mandibular nerve: auriculotemporal and masseteric
