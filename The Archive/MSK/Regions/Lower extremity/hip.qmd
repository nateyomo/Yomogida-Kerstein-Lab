# Lumbopelvic Movement

:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### pelvic pronation
lumbopelvic hip complex during ground impact is a combination of 3-D shock-absorbing movements driving the pelvis into an anterior tilt, forward rotation, contralateral drop, and concomitant spinal extension/rotation and relative sacral nutation. Triplanar pelvic motion is analogous to pronation at the footâ€”an important mechanism for absorbing ground reaction forces6 and a key antecedent for effective propulsion during gait @dischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019
