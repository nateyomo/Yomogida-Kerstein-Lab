# Lumbopelvic Movement

:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### pelvic pronation
lumbopelvic hip complex during ground impact is a combination of 3-D shock-absorbing movements driving the pelvis into an anterior tilt, forward rotation, contralateral drop, and concomitant spinal extension/rotation and relative sacral nutation. Triplanar pelvic motion is analogous to pronation at the foot—an important mechanism for absorbing ground reaction forces6 and a key antecedent for effective propulsion during gait @dischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019

# Biomechanics

## BIOMECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES OF COXA VARA AND COXA VALGA
"As previously described in this chapter, the average angle of inclination of the femoral neck is approximately 125 degrees (see Fig. 12.7A). The angle may be changed as a result of a surgical repair of a fractured hip or the specific design of a prosthetic hip. In addition, a surgical operation known as a coxa	 vara (or valga) osteotomy intentionally alters a preexisting angle of inclina­ tion. This operation involves cutting a wedge of bone from the proximal femur, thereby changing the orientation of the femoral head to the acetabulum. A goal of this operation is often to improve the congruency of the weight­bearing surfaces of the hip.e" @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017

# Kinematics

## Flexion

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
### Osteokinematics

- 120 &deg; flexion (when the knee is flexed) @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022 

### Arthrokinematics

- Posterior/inferior glide/spin (According to class)

### Limits

- inferior joint capsule and ischiofemoral ligament (inf fibers), gluteus maximus, soft tissue – thigh to trunk
- When the knee is extended we have passive insufficiency of the hip flexors -> now only have 80-90 degrees of hip flexion
    - passive insufficiency from hamstrings, gracilis

:::

## Extension

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
### Osteokinematics

- 10-20 &deg;
- "0 &deg; of hip extension when knee flexed"

### Arthrokinematics

- Anterior slide & spin (According to class)

### Limits

- anterior joint capsule, capsular ligaments (iliofemoral, ischiofemoral (if IR), pubofemoral)
- Rectus femoris will limit hip flexion more if the knee is extended since the RF crosses both the hip and knee
- Iliofemoral ligament is stressed during hip extension -> will limit hip extension
- Ischifemoral ligament comes from posterior side of capsule and wraps around to the front -> hip extension would pull the fibers down and cause stress -> limits hip extension when the hip is IR
