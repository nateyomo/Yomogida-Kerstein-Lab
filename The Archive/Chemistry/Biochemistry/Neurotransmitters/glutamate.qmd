# Overview

- Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
- 

# Dysfunction
## Excitotoxicity caused neurodegeneration
- Excess glutamate triggers a cascade of events leading to cell death @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019

# Related pathologies
## Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
- [Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]({{< var ref-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.path >}}) via [excitotoxicity](##excitotoxicity)
    - Increased levels of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and in postmortem tissue of individuals with ALS have been reported @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
    - Researchers attribute a deficiency in [excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2)]({{< var ref-EAAT2-excitatory-amino-acid-transporter-2.path >}}) in the motor cortex and spinal cord of postmortem ALS tissue was reported and lends support to the theory of excitotoxicity causing neurodegeneration.
