title: Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Gamma (PPAR-&gamma;)
---

type II nuclear receptor, initially recognized in adipose tissue for its role in fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism

It promotes lipid uptake and adipogenesis by increasing insulin sensitivity and adiponectin release.


# Function

PPAR-&gamma; has 3 primary functions

1. Regulate anabolism of the adipose tissue @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
1. Important role in glucose metabolism @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
1. Important role in cardiac development @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021 


# Relationship to TGF-&beta;
another superfamily, the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&beta;), and its receptors, all of which play a major role in *Pulmonary artierial hypertension* and kidney failure


TGF-&beta; is a multifunctional cytokine that drives inflammation, fibrosis, and cell differentiation while PPARÎ³ activation reverses these adverse events in many models


# Genes

In humans, the PPAR-&gamma; gene contains nine exons spanning over 100 kilobases located on *chromosome 3* @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021

# Gene regulation

PPAR-&gamma; can regulate target genes by forming a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021

# Mutations

Mutations in PPAR-&gamma; gene have been associated with:

1. Lipid homeostasis dysfunction @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
1. Glucose homeostasis dysfunction @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021

Which lead to secondary pathologies of:

1. Obesity @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
1. Thyroid Cancer @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
