title: Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Subfamily (PPAR)
---

PPAR-&alpha;, PPAR-&delta;, PPAR-&gamma; are ligand-activated transcription factors of the PPAR nuclear receptor superfamily that function to regulate metabolic homeostasis of the cell @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021

- Subfamily of nuclear receptors
- PPARs form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and these heterodimers regulate transcription of various genes

# Subtypes

There are three known subtypes:

1. PPAR-alpha
1. PPAR-delta
1. PPAR-gamma

## PPAR-&gamma;

PPAR-&gamma; has 3 primary functions

1. Regulate anabolism of the adipose tissue @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
1. Important role in glucose metabolism @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
1. Important role in cardiac development @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021
