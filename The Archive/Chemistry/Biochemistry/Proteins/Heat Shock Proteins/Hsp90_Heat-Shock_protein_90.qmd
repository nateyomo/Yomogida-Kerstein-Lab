# Direct Effects

# Indirect effects


# Abnormal Expression

Abnormal expression of Hsp90 has been attributed to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021.


# Interplay

Hsp90 may have a strong interaction with PPAR-&gamma; @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021.
Hsp90 can play a role to stabilize PPAR-&gamma; in liver cells and adipocytes @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021.
Thus when Hsp90 expression is increased, the PPAR-&gamma; experiences improvements in stability and levels.
Hsp90 overexpression diminishes PPAR-&gamma; degredation @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021.
The opposite effect is also true, when Hsp90 is inhibited, PPAR-&gamma; levels are decreased @kokenyPPARgTGFvMajorRegulators2021.
