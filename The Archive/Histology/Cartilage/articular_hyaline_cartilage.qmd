title: Articular (Hyaline) Cartilage
---


Found in load‐bearing joint surfaces in
synovial joints.


# Function

The tissue matrix of healthy cartilage bears ~15% of load

# Injury

## OA: progressive failure mechanism:

1. Single high‐magnitude OR repetitive stress resulting in perforation of articular cartilage.
2. Decreasd fluid pressurization resulting in load transfer
from fluid to tissue matrix
3. Increased stress on tissue matrix results in further
damage
4. RESULTS:
    - Erosion of articular cartilage resulting in exposure of subchondral bone resulting in pain 
    - Decreased ability to withstand loads

Repair of articular cartilage often incomplete due to poor vascularization
