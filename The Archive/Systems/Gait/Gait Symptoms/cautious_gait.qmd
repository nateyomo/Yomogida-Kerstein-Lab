title: Cautious Gait
---

Cautious gait is a complex gait disorder originating from dysfunction at the CNS.

# Gait

Cautious gait is characterized by a normal or mildly widened base, a shortened stride, slowness of walking, and turning *en bloc* @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022.

With this gait strategy, the center of gravity remains within the limits of the base of support @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022.

This is not always a pathological gait, sometimes it is necessary due to the environment. For example, walking on an icy street may force normal individuals to adopt a similar gait pattern to minimize the risk of falling @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022.

# Clinical Presentation

This gait disorder is seen mainly in older people. It may represent a milder or compensatory phase of any of the disorders causing poor balance and is not localizing @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022
