title: Human Locomotion
---



The foundational elements of bipedal locomotion include 

1. The appropriate alignment, strength, and control of the lower extremities (LEs) and trunk to support body mass @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
1. The ability to generate locomotor rhythm @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
1. Dynamic balance control (the ability to maintain stability and orientation with the center of mass [COM] over the base of support [BOS] while parts of the body are in motion) @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
1. The propulsion of the body in the intended direction; and (5) the adaptability of locomotor responses to changing task and environmental demands @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016


# Factors that affect Locomotor interventions

- The presenting pathology @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Weightbearing status @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Body/structure impairments and activity limitations that affect movement @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016


# Areas to Assess

:::{layout-ncol="3"}

### Postural alignment and balance control

### Joint integrity and mobility

### Motor function

- (motor control and motor learning) @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016

### Muscle performance

- Strength
- Power
- Endurance

### range of motion (ROM)


### Sensory function

- DCML
- Vestibular
- Visual System
- Central sensory integration (the capacity of the brain to organize, interpret, and use sensory information) @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- The patientâ€™s ability to use sensory input from the skin and musculoskeletal system to assist in locomotor control @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
