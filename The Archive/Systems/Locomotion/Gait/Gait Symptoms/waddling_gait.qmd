title: Waddling Gait
---


Weakness of the hip muscles, particularly the gluteus medius, results in an excessive drop of the hip and trunk tilting to the side opposite the foot placement. The hips oscillate up and down with every step, making the patient seem to waddle. With muscle weakness, there is accentuation of the lumbar lordosis @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022.
