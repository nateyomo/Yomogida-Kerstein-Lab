# Biomechanics

Steppage gait occurs from excessive flexion of the hips and knees with every step @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022

Impairments causing this compensation include:



# Causes

## Sensory loss

Severe deafferentation can cause steppage gait @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022

- Sensory loss results in the heel heavily striking the ground @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022
- Patients use a greater foot clearance to prevent them from tripping on the toes or on floor irregularities that are poorly felt @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022. 


Severe thick-fiber neuropathy is the most common cause:
- Can be caused by [Guillain–Barré syndrome]({{< var ref-guillain-barre-syndrome.path >}}) and other demyelinating neuropathies,
- Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (Hereditary)


## Motor Loss
