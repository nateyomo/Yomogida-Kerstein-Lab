# Training Principles

- Impairment based @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016 
- Task oriented to the specific task of walking @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016 
- Goal directed and meaningful to the patient @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016 
- Shaped and progressed to maximally challenge the patientâ€™s capabilities @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016 
- Performed multiple times (high number of repetitions) @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016 


# Interventions

## High Stepping

# Locomotor Training Environments

:::{layout-ncol="3"}

### Parallel bars

- Sit-to-stand and reverse with and/or without assistive device
- Static and dynamic standing balance with and/or without assistive device
- Use of appropriate gait pattern with and/or without assistive device while progressing forward and turning 
    - (because of limited space, it may not be possible to use an assistive device in standard parallel bars)
- Weight shifting and weight acceptance
- [High-stepping](#high-stepping)
- Stepping forward, backward, sideward, and turning


### Overground indoors

- Appropriate gait pattern and assistive device use
- Weight shifting and weight acceptance
- Stepping forward, backward, and sideward
- Crossed-stepping and braiding
- Walking over and around objects (i.e., obstacle course)
- Crossing thresholds and entering/exiting through doorways
- Variations in locomotor task demands (e.g., altering speed, scanning for objects, dual-task activity
- Stairs
- Falling and transitioning from the floor to standing
- Running


### Overground Community

- Curb climbing, negotiating ramps, stairs, and sloped surfaces @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Walking over even and uneven terrain @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Walking within imposed timing requirements (e.g., crossing at a stoplight, on/off elevators, escalators) @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Walking for long distances @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Walking at varying speeds, walk using a rhythmic timing device (e.g. metronome) @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Walking while scanning for objects in the environment @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Dual-task training while walking (cognitive and/or motor dual tasks) @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Walking in open environment with distracters @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Entering/exiting transportation vehicles @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Running @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016


### BW Support / Treadmill

- Treadmills are a useful tool to progress an individual from maximally tolerated LE load bearing to no BW support @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Reciprocal stepping pattern with manual assistance at LEs and/or trunk with normal or near normal lower extremity and trunk/pelvis kinematics progressing to no manual assistance @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Production of rhythmical stepping pattern with arm swing and minimal to no weightbearing through the upper extremities @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Progress stepping speeds to normative values based on age @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Walking forward, sideward, and backward @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Strategies to minimize abnormal/compensatory movement patterns @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Strategies to improve aerobic capacity @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016

### BW Support Overground

- Walking overground with maximally tolerated lower extremity load bearing progressing to no BWS @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Use of assistive device (if indicated) for walking on level surfaces @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Reciprocal stepping pattern with manual assistance at pelvis with normal or near normal lower extremity and trunk/pelvis kinematics progressing to no manual assistance @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Production of rhythmical, coordinated stepping pattern with arm swing and minimal weightbearing through the upper extremities @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Strategies to minimize abnormal/compensatory movement patterns @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Strategies to maintain/regain balance when perturbed @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016

### Assistive Devices

- Function and purpose of assistive device @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Sit-to-stand and reverse with assistive device @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Static and dynamic standing balance with assistive device @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Gait pattern @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
- Use of assistive device and appropriate gait pattern indoor overground and overground in community @osullivanImprovingFunctionalOutcomes2016
