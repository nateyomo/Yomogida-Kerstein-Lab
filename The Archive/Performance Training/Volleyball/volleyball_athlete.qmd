"One of the most important technical parts of the game is the spike attack, which was identified as a major performance indicator (Drikos and Vagenas, 2011)" @challoumasVolleyballAthleteShoulder2017


# Positions

The development of the game has led to anthropometric differences between attacking players (middle blockers, outside hitters, and opposites) compared to non-attacking players (setters and liberos) in females and males (Gualdi-Russo and Zaccagni, 2001; Palao et al., 2014) @challoumasVolleyballAthleteShoulder2017

# Injuries & Adaptations
See: The volleyball athlete's shoulder: biomechanical adaptations and injury associations @challoumasVolleyballAthleteShoulder2017

"since shoulder injuries in indoor volleyball, like other overhead sports, are very common (16-19% of all overuse injuries, Seminati and Minetti, 2013) due to the high amount of more than 40000 attacks/year (Kugler et al., 1996)" @challoumasVolleyballAthleteShoulder2017
