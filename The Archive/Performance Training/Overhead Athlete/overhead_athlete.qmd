# Clinical presentation

Chronic shouler pain

- Impingement secondary to another condition:
    - "Athletes with chronic shoulder pain present symptoms of impingement as a result from different shoulder conditions like rotator cuff tendinopathy, shoulder instability, scapular dyskinesis, biceps pathology, SLAP (superior labrum anterior-superior) lesions, and GIRD (glenohumeral internal rotation deficit) (Cools and Reeser, 2017)" @challoumasVolleyballAthleteShoulder2017



# Assessment

## Mobility

- AROM in OKC,
- AROM in CKC? --> depends on sport ie gymnastics
- Kinetic chain rotation
- Thoracic rotation
- Dissociated rotation

## Strength

- HHD
- ER:IR ratio,
- Max or mod press/push/pull data *bench press, push up, pull*
- MMT
    - 
    - Nagatomi et al 2016 found that MMTs were not effective at determining muscle strength symmetry above 75â€“85%.
    - MMT was only able to detect problems when there one muscle was 25% weaker (75% as strong) compared to other side
