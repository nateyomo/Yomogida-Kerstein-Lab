# Notes on how to begin hitting aerials

Speed and timing are the main prerequisite skills combined with a wave that allows for a couple pumps (speed) and becomes vertical enough for one to launch off of.

## Speed
- If you go too fast you will be sent to the moon and lose control.
- The goal is to launch while but only slightly off the wave and controlled.
    - 1/5 m is the starting goal here.

## Timing

- Look for small wedging end sections
- Like a waist/chest high wave with a nice little waist high wedge launch ramp. 

You need a wave that will let you get a few pumps for speed, then is vertical enough to actually let you launch up and out over it, not a mushy wall that's really slopey. If you need to stall up and wait for the section to start closing out. If you watch pros they'll frequently stomp the tail and wait for the wave to wall up more, then pump down the line a few times before launching off the lip.

As far as how long it takes, it just depends on the person and I think more importantly age. I learned to surf around 8-10 and didn’t learn to do a real air until 8th grade. So however long that is was my time taken. Im 30 now and still trying to learn how to do new grabs and rotations. Also, I think as a kid its a bit easier as you are trying to one up all your friends etc and have 8hr surf days and endless energy haha.

## What kind of waves are best for learning?


- Waves that throw a nice lip
- Not too big heavy or shallow, so you can get enough energy to go up in the air from the wave. 

Probably a good size to start is like waist to chest high. You don't need super long waves, you just need the right section that throws a nice lip and you need to time it right. I'd recommend practicing stalling up high on the wave next to the white water while you wait for the close out section to stand up, then pump and get some speed and hit the lip at the right time and you'll do an air. It's all about timing. You want the lip to hit you forward toward the beach so you don't go out the back of the wave. Having a super light board will help too because it's very quick and lighter so it will go in the air easier.

# Be Careful!
Launching higher and higher on aerials without "soft landings" is a great way to break your board into many pieces.

When you launch high, go for a grab. This technique allows you to bail and toss the board to the side safely


# FS Air

{{< video https://youtu.be/ekgfptN7tQk >}}

<q>
FS Air, three critical features were identified: (i) landing with the feet greater than hip width apart, (ii) landing with the lead ankle in a dorsiflexed position, and (iii) landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard

## Landing mechanics

- Critical features
    - Critical Feature (i): Landing with lead ankle in dorsiflexion @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018
    - Critical Feature (ii): Landing with feet greater than hip width apart @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018
    - Critical Feature (iii): Landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018
        - "Dorsiflexing the ankle is also likely to be coupled with knee flexion, which would ensure the surfer’s total body centre of mass remains within their base of support, as well as over the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard (see Critical Feature (iii))" @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018



### Lead ankle)
<q>
Critical Feature (i): Landing with lead ankle in dorsiflexion. During landing tasks, athletes aim to move through the greatest available range of joint motion in order to dampen the impact forces they experience27. This is typically characterised by athletes displaying a plantar flexed ankle at initial ground contact to enable the largest possible range of ankle joint motion during the subsequent landing thereby increasing the time over which the impact forces are absorbed

Results of the present study, however, have shown that landing an aerial with the lead (front) ankle in a dorsiflexed position at initial board-wave contact, rather than a plantar flexed position, was significantly associated with a successful landing

Explanation: This apparently contradictory finding can be explained by the need for a surfer to maintain contact with their surfboard throughout the final stages of the airborne phase and into the landing phase of the aerial manoeuvre
</q> @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018

### Rear ankle
<q> During the airborne phase, plantar flexion of the rear ankle would result in downward movement of the surfboard tail. As there is a need to maintain constant contact with the surfboard, this downward movement of the surfboard tail would assist in keeping the nose of the surfboard up, leaving the lead ankle in a dorsiflexed position </q> @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018

"Dorsiflexing the ankle is also likely to be coupled with knee flexion, which would ensure the surfer’s total body centre of mass remains within their base of support, as well as over the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard" @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018
:::

### Base of Support

<q>
A wider base of support enhances stability when performing a discrete skill, and was also evident when landing aerials in surfing. 
A wide base of support provides a greater area over which a surfer’s total body centre of gravity can travel before generating a perturbing torque.
This increased tolerance for error is particularly useful when trying to land on a largely unpredictable surface such as a wave.
A wide stance also helps the surfer position their centre of mass closer to the centre of buoyance of the surfboard, as discussed below (see Critical Feature (iii))
<q> @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018 


### Center of Mass (COM)

The third clinical feature described by Forsyth (2018) was "Landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard" @forsythUnderstandingSuccessfulUnsuccessful2018

<q>
was Due to the relative unpredictability of surfing and the open nature of a surfing environment, ensuring a surfer lands over the centre of their surfboard is essential to limit the effect of any unexpected perturbations, which might occur because of the changing water surface. Positioning the total body centre of mass directly above the centre of buoyancy of the surfboard reduces the potential to generate any destabilising torques31 during landing. The effect of not adhering to this critical feature was evident in the FS Air Reverse when athletes landed with their total body centre of mass over the nose of the surfboard, which was significantly associated with unsuccessful performance of the manoeuvre (see Table 4).

# FS Air-Reverse


<q>
For the FS Air Reverse, five critical features were identified: (i) landing with the lead ankle in a dorsiflexed position, (ii) landing with the chest over the lead knee, (iii) landing with the total body centre of mass over the centre of the surfboard, (iv) moving through a large range of trunk flexion (>45°) throughout the landing phase, and (v) having an apparent gaze directed at the water in front of the hips.
