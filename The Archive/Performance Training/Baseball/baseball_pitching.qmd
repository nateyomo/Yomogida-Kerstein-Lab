The key to efficient pitching mechanics is to connect the global kinetic chain as it spirals from the ground up toward the hand in a form of kinetic linking @dischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019


Tension increases as energy moves up the kinetic chain. However, when there is a loss of system tension (eg, with a lax anterior shoulder capsule or poor scapular stability), adequate transfer of force to the ball is lost (loss of stored energy), and the velocity of the ball is decreased @dischiaviRethinkingDynamicKnee2019


# Pitching Biomechanics

- Wind Up: Initial Movement to Maximum Knee Lift
- Early Cocking: Maximum Knee Lift to Lead Foot Contact
- Late Cocking: Lead Foot Contact to Maximal Shoulder ER
- Acceleration: Maximal Shoulder ER to Ball Release
- Deceleration: Ball Release to Maximum Shoulder IR
- Follow Through: Maximum Shoulder IR to Body Stops Moving
