# Gender

## Hormone Differences

- [Testosterone]({{< var ref-testosterone.path >}}) causes increased protein deposition, especially in muscles, which causes men to have more muscle then women due to increased testosterone levels @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- [Estrogen]({{< var ref-estrogen.path >}})

## Strength
:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### Strength per CSA

- There is virtually *no* difference in gender when measured in terms of strength (peak force duriing maximal contraction) per square centimeter of cross-sectional area @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021 
    - 3 and 4 Kg/cm^2^ @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
- Thus, the majority of differences in absolute muscle performance is due to the increased muscle to BW ratio of men than women @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021 

### Overall Muscle strength

- Compared to BW?
- Females are typically $\frac{2}{3} \textrm{to} \frac{3}{4}$ the value of men @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021

### Pulmonary Ventilation

- Females are typically $\frac{2}{3} \textrm{to} \frac{3}{4}$ the value of men @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021

## Cardiac Function

### Cardiac Output

- Females are typically $\frac{2}{3} \textrm{to} \frac{3}{4}$ the cardiac output of men @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021

## Sport Differences

### Better male performance

- In marathons, the top female performer ran 11% slower than the top male performer @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021.

### Better Female Performance

- For other events, however, women have at times held records faster than menâ€”for example, for the two-way swim across the English Channel, for which the availability of extra fat seems to be an advantage for heat insulation, buoyancy, and extra long-term energy." @hallGuytonHallTextbook2021
