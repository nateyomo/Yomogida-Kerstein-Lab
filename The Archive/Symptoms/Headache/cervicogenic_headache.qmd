- Occipital Neuralgia
:::




Cervicogenic headache is a headache characterized by referred pain to the head from cervical spine @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

# Epidemiology

- No genetic factor
    - No familial hx



# Etiology

- Myofascial tightness
- Stimulation of certain joints/discs in teh c spine have been shown to produce pain in the occipital region
- Pain in AA (C1-2) joint → pain is focused on occipital and suboccipital regions, and referred to vertex, orbit, and ear
- C2-C3 pain can also occur in occipital region and spread across parietal region to frontal region/orbit


# Pathophysiology



Bogduk (2009) provided an explanation for the underlying pain:

- Convergence between cervical and trigeminal afferents in [trigeminocervical nucleus]({{< var ref-spinal-trigeminal-nucleus.trigeminocervical-nucleus >}}) @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009
- At the [trigeminocervical nucleus]({{< var ref-spinal-trigeminal-nucleus.trigeminocervical-nucleus >}}), nociceptive afferents from C1, 2, 3 spinal nerves converge onto 2nd order neurons that also receive afferents from adjacent cervical nerves and from 1st division of the [trigeminal nerve CNV]({{< var ref-cn5.path >}}) via the trigeminal nerve spinal tract @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009.




# Clinical Presentation

![Referred pain patterns after noxious stimulation of basal occipital periosteum and interspinous muscles at C1–2, C2–3, C3–4, C4–5, and C5–6 @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009](/The Archive/Symptoms/Headache/images/bogduk 2009 fig2.png)

## Precipitation & Aggravation

- Neck position
- Neck movements
- Sustained positions/postures
    - Especially neck flexion
- Stress
- Tension

## Onset

- Occassional Warning signs
    - Aura (potentially)
- May wake up w headache
- Increases as day progresses (influenced by activity)

## Aggravations / Eases

- Influenced by daily activities
- Stress, tension, neck flexion, head position - can trigger or relieve 

# Symptoms

- Non-continuous unilateral neck pain associated w HA

## Area of Symptoms

- Unilateral (may be BIL)
- Starts sub-occipital
- radiates into temporal, frontal, or retro-orbital
- Does NOT change sides

## Quality

- Dulle ache or boring pain
    - May have stabbing, deep pain
- Moderate to severe

## Associated symptoms

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Bradycardia
- Blurred vision
- Difficulty swallowing
- Sensitivity
    - Photophobia
    - Phonophobia

# Examination

Clinical diagnostic criteria have not proved valid but by using nerve blocks, cervical source of pain can be established @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

- C/S flexion rotation test is positive
- HA reproduced w provocation of the involved upper C/s segments
- Limited C/s ROM
- Restricted upper C/s mobility
- Neck muscles impairments
    - Strength
    - Endurance
    - Coordination

Most reliable features:

- Pain that starts in the neck and radiates to the fronto-temporal region @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009
- Pain that radiates to the ipsilateral shoulder and arm @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009
- Provocation of pain by neck mvmt @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

# Special  Tests

- Flexion Rotation Test 
    - "This test is used to determine the presence of a cervicogenic headache and is both a range of motion and provocation test. The patient is positioned in supine, and resting symptoms are noted. The patient is asked to maximally flex his or her neck and to hold that position. Using both hands, the clinician applies a full rotational force to both sides and notes any changes in symptoms (Fig. 25-54). The test is considered positive for a cervicogenic headache if a loss of 10 degrees or greater is noted when comparing both sides. Given the testing position, it is likely that C1–2 is the tested level. A single blind, age and gender matched, comparative measurement study by Hall and Robinson60 found this test to have a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% (QUADAS score of 12)." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 

## Clinical Diagnostic Criteria

Bogduk (2009) Clinical criteria @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

1. Unilateral HA without side shift 
1. Symptoms/signs of neck involvement: pain triggered by neck mvmts or sustained awkward posture and/or external pressure of ipsi neck, shoulder, and arm pain, reduced ROM
1. Pain episodes of varying duration or fluctuation continuous pain
1. Moderate non excruciating pain, usually of non throbbing nature
1. Pain starting in the neck, spreading to oculo-fronto-temporal areas
1. Anesthetics blockades abolish the pain transiently provided complete anesthesia is obtained, or occurrence of sustained neck trauma shortly before onset
1. Various attack related events: autonomic symptoms and signs, nausea, vomiting, ispi odema and flushing in the peri ocular area, dizziness, photophobia, phobophobia or blurred vision in the ipsilateral eye  


## Tests

- Manual diagnosis has not been validated @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009
- [(+) Cervical rotation lateral flexion test]({{< var ref-cervical-rotation-lateral-flexion-test.path >}})


# DDX

- **Vascular**: Dissecting aneurysms of vertebral or internal carotid arteries which can present w neck pain or headache @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009.
- **C2 neuralgia**: intermittent lancinating pain in occipital region associated w lacrimation adn ciliary injection @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

# Pharmacology

No drugs were found to be effective in treatment of cervicogenic headaches @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009.

# Invasive Treatment

- C2-3 iv disc= cervical fusion can be effective if the pain is originating from a discogenic problem @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

Steroid injections

- Z-joint C2-3 steroid injections are a low risk treatment and some patients benefit @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009
- Only definitive txt for ha stemming from c2-3 z joint is radiofrequency neurotomy @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

# Conservative Treatment

Overall, exercise was found to be the best treatment and all other treatments were speculative @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009.

## Manual Therapy

- Manual therapy alone was found not to be more effective than exercise alone @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009

## Exercise

Exercise was found to be effective @bogdukCervicogenicHeadacheAssessment2009.
