"Perseveration is the continued repetition of words, thoughts, or acts not related to current context. Thus, the patient gets “stuck” and repeats words or acts without much success at stopping. Preservation results from lesions in the premotor and/or prefrontal cortex." @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
