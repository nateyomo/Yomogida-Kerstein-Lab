# Fox and Haskell: 

$$
\textrm{HR max} = 220 - \textrm{Age}
$$

:::{.callout-caution}
Both the Fox & Haskell test and the Tanaka have high standard error, and can vary between age and condition matched individuals 
:::

# Tanaka HRMax

$$
\textrm{HR max} = 208 - (0.7 \times \textrm{Age})
$$

:::{.callout-caution}
Both the Fox & Haskell test and the Tanaka have high standard error, and can vary between age and condition matched individuals
