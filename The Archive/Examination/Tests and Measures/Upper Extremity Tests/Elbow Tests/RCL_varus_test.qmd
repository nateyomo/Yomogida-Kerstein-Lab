title: Radial Collateral Ligament (Lateral) Varus Test
---


"The LCL is tested with the elbow positioned in 5â€“30 degrees short of full extension. The clinician stabilizes the humerus and adducts the ulna, producing a varus force at the elbow (Fig. 17-40). The end-feel is noted. No diagnostic accuracy studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity or specificity of this test." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
