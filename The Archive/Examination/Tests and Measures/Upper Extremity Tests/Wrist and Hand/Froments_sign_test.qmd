title: Froment's Sign
subtitle: Special Test for Ulnar nerve motor function
---


"This is more of a sign than a test and may present as a complaint from the patient who reports an inability to pinch between the index finger and the thumb without flexion occurring at the DIP joint (Fig. 18-70). " @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 

# Mechanism

Ulnar nerve lesion, resulting in weakness of Adductor pollicis brevis and FPB Short head muscles @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
The weakness of these two, causes the FPL to become overactive and flex the DIP.

# Scoring
A Positive Froment Sign occurs when the patient cannot keep their thumb adducted during the pinch.

# Interpretation 

Positive test indicates an ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow or at the wrist @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
