# Mechanics

OK Sign tests the [Anterior Interossoues Nerve]({{< var ref-anterior-interosseous-nerve.path >}}) by creating a position that biases both the FPL and FDP.
The OK Sign requires both 2nd finger DIP flexion (FDP) and thumb DIP flexion (FPL).
If these are not achieved, this indicates muscle weakness.
