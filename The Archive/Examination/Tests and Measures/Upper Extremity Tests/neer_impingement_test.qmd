title: Neer Impingmenet Test
---

"While scapular rotation is prevented by one hand of the clinician, the arm of the patient is passively forced into elevation at an angle between flexion and abduction by the clinician’s other hand. Overpressure is applied with the G-H joint in neutral, IR, and then ER (Fig. 16-53). A positive Neer impingement test result is thought to represent impingement of the RC on the anterosuperior glenoid rim or coracoacromial ligament. MacDonald et al.120 demonstrated 75% sensitivity of the Neer sign for subacromial bursitis but overall poor specificity." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 

"The Neer impingement sign test29 was performed with the patient in a standing position. The patient’s arm was passively elevated in forward flexion until the patient reported pain. This test was considered positive if there was pain into the deltoid or biceps region, anteriorly or laterally." @gillPhysicalExaminationPartial2007
