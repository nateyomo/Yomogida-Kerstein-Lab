"Kennedy-Hawkins sign test was performed with the patient standing. The affected arm was forward-flexed 90Â° and then forcibly medially rotated. This test was considered positive if the patient complained of pain into the deltoid or anterior shoulder during the maneuver" @gillPhysicalExaminationPartial2007
