title: Painful Arc Test
---


"Painful Arc Test. The patient stands and, while being observed by the clinician, is asked to actively abduct the involved shoulder. A positive test for subacromial impingement is indicated if the patient reports shoulder pain in the 60–120-degree range. Pain outside this range is considered a negative test, and pain that increases in severity as the arm reaches 180 degrees is indicative of “a disorder of the A-C joint.” The painful arc test has a specificity of 80%.127 However, although this test is good at detecting subacromial impingement, a positive finding is unlikely to aid the clinician in determining a specific diagnosis as there are a number of conditions that can be provoked with arm elevation (Table 16-25)" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
