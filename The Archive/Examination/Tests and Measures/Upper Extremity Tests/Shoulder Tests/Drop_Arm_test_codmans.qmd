title: Drop Arm Test (Codman's)
---


"Drop-arm (Codman’s) Test. The clinician passively raises the patient’s arm to 90 degrees of abduction. The patient is asked to lower their arm with their palm down (Fig. 16-68). If at any point in the descent, the patient’s arm drops, it is indicative of an RC injury (Table 16-27). The drop arm test has been reported to be 35% sensitive and 88% specific for full-thickness tears and 14.3% sensitive and 78% specific for partial-thickness tears.126" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
