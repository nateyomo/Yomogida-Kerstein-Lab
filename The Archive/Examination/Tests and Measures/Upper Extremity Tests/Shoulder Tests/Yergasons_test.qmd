title: Yergason's Test
---


"Yergason’s Test.132 The patient sits or stands, and the upper arm is positioned with the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion and the forearm pronated. The patient is asked to supinate his or her forearm against the manual resistance of the clinician (Fig. 16-75). A positive result is indicated by pain over the bicipital groove or subluxation of the LHB. Authors have reported the Yergason test to have a sensitivity of 41% and a specificity of 79% for biceps pathology.131 Speed’s and Yergason’s tests probably discriminate bicipital tendon disorders. However, irritation and edema may also occur in the long head of biceps in any stage of SIS. Biceps tendons may be thickened by fibrinoid degeneration in the SIS. This may lead to an inappropriate diagnosis of primary bicipital tendinopathy and subsequent tenodesis.117" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
