title: Internal Rotation Over Pressure Test for the Hip
---



"This maneuver is used to assess both FAI and labral pathology. The patient lies in the supine position, and the affected leg is brought into flexion and internal rotation with the application of axial compression. Reproduction of pain is considered a positive test. Sensitivity of this maneuver has been reported to be 75â€“89% [25,26]. Maslowski et al. compared IROP, Scour test, FABER, and Stinchfield tests, and they found IROP to have the highest positive predictive value for intraarticular hip pathology" @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022
