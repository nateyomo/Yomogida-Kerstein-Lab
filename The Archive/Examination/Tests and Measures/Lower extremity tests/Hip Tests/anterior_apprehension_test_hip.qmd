title: Anterior Apprehension Test of the Hip
subtitle: Hyperextension, External Rotation Test
---

"This test is performed with the patient supine at the end of the exam table. With the contralateral leg flexed toward the chest and the affected leg hyperextended over the end of the table, the affected hip is externally rotated, which puts the anterior capsule on stretch (Figure 9). The test is positive if this maneuver elicits anteriorhippainorapprehension[43]. Of note, posterior hip pain in this maneuver may signify posterior impingement. This test has been found to be 71% sensitive and 85% specific for the diagnosis of microinstability, with a positive predictive value of 86%" @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022
