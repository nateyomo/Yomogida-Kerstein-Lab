"This test is performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position with the affected hip up. The hip is extended, abducted to 30°, and externally rotated. The examiner then places an anteriorly directed force posterior to the greater trochanter (Figure 10). The test is positive if the patient’ssymptoms of pain or apprehension are reproduced [43]. This test has been found to be 81% sensitive and 89% specific for the diagnosis of microinstability, with a positive predictive value of 91% [44]." @wongPhysicalExaminationHip2022
