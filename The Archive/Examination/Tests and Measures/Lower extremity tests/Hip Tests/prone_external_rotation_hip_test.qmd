title: Prone External Rotation Test of the Hip
---

This test is performed with the patient in the prone position and the hip in neutral flexion extension. The hip is then externally rotated and the examiner places an anteriorly directed force posterior to the greater trochanter (Figure 11). The test is positive if the patientâ€™spain or apprehension is reproduced [43]. This test has been found to be 33% sensitive and 98% specific. It is important to examine the patient with a number of different tests to improve diagnostic accuracy. Hoppe et al. demonstrated a 95% positive predictive value for diagnosis of microinstability if the anterior apprehension test, abduction-extension-external rotation test, and prone external rotation test are all positive [44].
