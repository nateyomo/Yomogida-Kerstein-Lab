title: Lateral Stability Test for the Lumbar Spine
---


"This test does not rely on the objectivity of the end-feel. Instead, an indirect shearing maneuver is used, and the reproduction of pain is considered a positive test. The patient lies in the side-lying position facing the clinician, with the lumbar spine positioned in neutral and the hips and knees flexed to approximately 45 degrees. The clinician, using the fleshy part of one forearm, applies a downward pressure on the lateral aspect of the patientâ€™s trunk at the level of the L3 transverse process (Fig. 28-49). This produces a lateral translation of the entire lumbar spine in the direction of the bed. The pressure is applied and monitored for pain. The test is repeated with the patient side lying on the opposite side." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
