title: Fortin's Finger Test
---


"The patient completes a pain diagram and is then instructed to point to the region of pain using only one finger. The clinician reviews the area of pain and pain diagram for consistency and then asks the patient to repeat the procedure of pointing to his or her pain. " @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 

A positive test for localization of SIJ pain has three criteria: 

- "The patient can localize the pain with one finger." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 
- "The area pointed to is within 1 cm of, and immediately inferomedial to, the PSIS." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 
- "The patient consistently points to the same area over at least two trials."  @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
