title: Gaenslen's Teset
---


"The patient is positioned supine at the edge of the side of the bed with the painful leg resting very near to the end of the bed, and the resting symptoms are assessed. The leg furthest from the edge of the bed (nontested leg) is flexed 90 degrees at the hip and held by the clinician using one hand. The clinician passively positions the upper leg (test leg) into hyperextension at the hip so that it hangs over the edge of the table (Fig. 29-25). The clinician applies a further stretch to the test leg into hip extension and adduction up to six times while a flexion-based counter force is applied to the flexed leg. Pain with this maneuver is considered a positive test for an SIJ lesion, pubic symphysis instability, hip pathology, or an L4 nerve root lesion. The test also stresses the femoral nerve." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
