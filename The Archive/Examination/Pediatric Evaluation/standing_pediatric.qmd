12 month

- Lordosis present
- alignment: babies can't turn abs on and breathe when standing (can't do both at the same time) so they use lordosis for stability (approx facets) and ant pelvic tilt is closed pack,
- Glutes not active, locking legs out, locked pelvis (ant pelvic tilt) = decreases muscle activity 
 able to bring head up without loss of balance/manipulate distal objects while standing,  
- Intrinsic foot muscle use, 
- Balance
