  abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most debilitating problems for humans. About 6 months after the initial injury, a cascade of secondary cellular and molecular events occurs and the primary damage enters the chronic phase. Current treatments are not curative. One of the new treatment methods is the use of cell therapy, which is gradually being tested in clinical trials to improve the symptoms of SCI patients. In this review article, we investigated the effect of different cell therapy trials in improving patients' symptoms and their paraclinical indicators. In the 72 final reviewed studies with 1144 cases and 186 controls, 20 scores were recorded as outcomes. We categorized the scores into seven groups. In upper extremity motor score, daily living function, trunk stability, postural hypotension, somatosensory evoked potential, and motor evoked potential scores, the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell therapy had a more healing effect. In the International Association of Neurorestoratology SCI Functional Rating Scale, light touch score, bowel function, decreased spasticity, Visual Analog Scale, and electromyography scores, the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell had more impact. The olfactory ensheathing cell had a greater effect on lower extremity motor score and pinprick scores than other cells. The embryonic stem cell had the greatest effect in improving the important score of the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Based on the obtained results, it seems that a special cell should be used to improve each symptom of patients with chronic SCI, and if the improvement of several harms is involved, the combination of cells may be effective.},

RECENT FINDINGS               In the past decade, the recognition of leukodystrophies has exponentially increased, and now this class includes more than 30 distinct disorders. Classically recognized as progressive and fatal disorders affecting young children, it is now understood that leukodystrophies are associated with an increasing spectrum of neurologic trajectories and can affect all ages. Next-generation sequencing and newborn screening allow the opportunity for the recognition of presymptomatic and atypical cases. These new testing opportunities, in combination with growing numbers of natural history studies and clinical consensus guidelines, have helped improve diagnosis and clinical care. Additionally, a more granular understanding of disease outcomes informs clinical trial design and has led to several recent therapeutic advances. This review summarizes the current understanding of the clinical manifestations of disease and treatment options for the most common leukodystrophies.                                         SUMMARY               As early testing becomes more readily available through next-generation sequencing and newborn screening, neurologists will better understand the true incidence of the leukodystrophies and be able to diagnose children within the therapeutic window. As targeted therapies are developed, it becomes increasingly imperative that this broad spectrum of disorders is recognized and diagnosed. This work summarizes key advances in the leukodystrophy field.},

Every person with migraine requires treatment for acute attacks. Treatments can range from behavioral management and nonspecific medications to migraine-specific medications and neuromodulation. For many with migraine, having a combination of tools allows for effective treatment of all types of attacks.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past several years, four neuromodulation devices have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of acute migraine, and three medications with novel mechanisms of action have been FDA approved. They add to the arsenal available to people with migraine and focus on migraine-specific pathways to allow for precise care with fewer side effects.

In healthy subjects, dextrose elevated PGL at 1 (53\%) and 2 (3\%) hours, and decreased PGL after 3 hours (20\%). Honey elevated PGL after 1 hour (14\%) and decreased it after 3 hours (10\%). Elevation of insulin and C-peptide was significantly higher after dextrose than after honey. Dextrose slightly reduced cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) after 1 hour and significantly after 2 hours, and increased TG after 1, 2, and 3 hours. Artificial honey slightly decreased cholesterol and LDL-C and elevated TG. Honey reduced cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG and slightly elevated high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Honey consumed for 15 days decreased cholesterol (7\%), LDL-C (1\%), TG (2\%), CRP (7\%), homocysteine (6\%), and PGL (6\%), and increased HDL-C (2\%). In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, artificial honey increased TG, while honey decreased TG. In patients with hyperlipidemia, artificial honey increased LDL-C, while honey decreased LDL-C. Honey decreased cholesterol (8\%), LDL-C (11\%), and CRP (75\%) after 15 days. In diabetic patients, honey compared with dextrose caused a significantly lower rise of PGL. Elevation of PGL was greater after honey than after sucrose at 30 minutes, and was lower after honey than it was after sucrose at 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Honey caused greater elevation of insulin than sucrose did after 30, 120, and 180 minutes. Honey reduces blood lipids, homocysteine, and CRP in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects. Honey compared with dextrose and sucrose caused lower elevation of PGL in diabetics.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To identify statistical errors and pitfalls in dissertations performed as part of the requirements for the Medical Doctorate (MD) degree at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University (CU) to improve the quality of medical research. Methods: A critical assessment of 62 MD dissertations conducted in 3 departments at NCI, CU, between 2009 and 2013 was carried out regarding statistical methodology and presentation of the results. To detect differences in study characteristics over time, grouping was into two periods; 2009-2010 and 2011-2013. Results: Statistical methods were appropriate in only 13 studies (24.5\%). The most common statistical tests applied were chi-square, log-rank, and Mann-Whitney tests. Four studies estimated sample size and/or power. Only 37.1\% and 38.7\% of dissertation results supported aims and answered the research questions, respectively. Most of results were misinterpreted (82.3\%) with misuse of statistical terminology (77.4\%). Tabular and graphical data display was independently informative in only 36 dissertations (58.1\%) with accurate titles and labels in only 17 (27.4\%). Statistical tests fulfilled the assumptions only in 29 studies; with evident misuse in 33. Ten dissertations reported non-significance regarding their primary outcome measure; the median power of the test was 35.5\% (range: 6-60\%). There was no significant change in the characteristics between the time periods. Conclusion: MD dissertations at NCI have many epidemiological and statistical defects that may compromise the external validity of the results. It is recommended to involve a biostatistician from the very start to improve study design, sample size calculation, end points estimation and measures.},

Recent Findings:               Advances in clinical phenotyping and outcomes assessment have enabled neurologists to improve disease recognition, treatment, and disease monitoring. Our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of demyelinating neuropathies is evolving. Identification of new antibodies and recognition that node of Ranvier dysfunction may be an early pathogenic feature may herald further diagnostic and treatment advancements.                                         Summary:               The chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies are heterogeneous. The clinical and diagnostic features are sometimes overlapping, and the specific disorders are variable in pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. This heterogeneity underscores the importance of achieving diagnostic accuracy and implementing disease-specific treatment approaches.},

It discusses the importance of diagnosing and detecting progression early, the similarities between progressive forms, challenges in detecting progression, factors that could augment progression, and the importance of disease-modifying therapies in patients with evidence of active progressive MS. It also discusses the overall care of progressive MS.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               The pathogenesis of primary progressive MS and secondary progressive MS is overlapping, and in both presentations, patients with relapses or focal MRI activity are classified as having active, progressive MS. All currently approved disease-modifying therapies are indicated for active secondary progressive MS. The therapeutic opportunity of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of progressive MS is enhanced in those who are younger and have a shorter disease duration. Vascular comorbidities may contribute to progression in MS.                                         SUMMARY               Several challenges remain in the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of progressive MS. Early identification of active progressive MS is needed to maximize treatment benefit. The advantages of optimal comorbidity management (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) in delaying progression are uncertain. Clinical care guidelines for advanced, severe MS are lacking.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Arterial ischemic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are increasingly recognized in childhood as important causes of lifelong morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke is frequently delayed, as acute neurologic deficits can be challenging to detect in the young child, and stroke is often not considered in the differential diagnosis. Neurologic sequelae following stroke are common, and strategies to minimize stroke size and optimize recovery are being developed. Recurrent arterial ischemic stroke is not uncommon, particularly in children with cerebral arteriopathy. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis causes obstruction of venous outflow leading to venous infarcts. Complications include hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts and increased intracranial pressure. Without treatment, thrombus extension with increased symptoms is common. Robust guidelines of care that exist for adults do not exist for children, particularly for children with arterial ischemic stroke.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to stroke in infants and children can be informed by clinical experience in pediatric stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the extensive literature on pediatric thrombosis, and extrapolation from data from adult patients.},

These therapies predispose patients to particular infections, some of which may affect the nervous system. Therefore, familiarity with the clinical and radiologic features of neurologic infections associated with specific immunomodulatory therapies is of importance for the practicing neurologist. This article reviews these neuroinfectious conditions, as well as other neurologic complications unique to transplant recipients and other patients who are immunocompromised.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Diagnosis of infectious pathogens in patients who are immunocompromised may be particularly challenging because a decreased immune response can lead to atypical imaging or laboratory findings. Next-generation sequencing and other novel diagnostic modalities may improve the rate of early identification of neurologic infections in patients who are immunocompromised and ultimately ameliorate outcomes in this vulnerable population.                                         SUMMARY               A broad range of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections of the nervous system can complicate solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation as well as other forms of immunocompromise. In addition to neurologic infections, such patients are at risk of neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory complications related to immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies. Early recognition of infectious and noninfectious complications of immunocompromise is essential to guide appropriate treatment, which can include antimicrobial therapy and, in some cases, withdrawal of the predisposing medication with a transition to an alternative regimen.},

The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the default functional measure currently used in most US hospitals, was used as a comparison standard for the SCIM III. Statistical analyses were used to test the validity and reliability of the SCIM III. RESULTS: Total agreement between raters was above 70\% on most SCIM III tasks and all {$\kappa$}-coefficients were statistically significant (P{$<$}0.001). The coefficients of Pearson correlation between the paired raters were above 0.81 and intraclass correlation coefficients were above 0.81. Cronbach's-{$\alpha$} was above 0.7, with the exception of the respiration task. The coefficient of Pearson correlation between the FIM and SCIM III was 0.8 (P{$<$}0.001). For the respiration and sphincter management subscale, the SCIM III was more responsive to change, than the FIM (P{$<$}0.0001). CONCLUSION: Overall, the SCIM III is a reliable and valid measure of functional change in SCI. However, improved scoring instructions and a few modifications to the scoring categories may reduce variability between raters and enhance clinical utility.},

Methods:               Fifty-six infants with MD (mean age = 10 months) and 36 with TD (mean age = 5.7 months) were assessed at baseline and then at 1.5, 3, and 6 months postbaseline. A scale was developed to measure object permanence (Object Permanence Scale [OPS]), and the Gross Motor Function Measure sitting subsection (GMFM-SS), and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) were administered.                                         Results:               Interrater reliability of the OPS was excellent and correlation between the OPS and Bayley-III cognitive scores was moderately positive. Compared with TD, infants with MD were delayed in development of object permanence but demonstrated increased understanding over time and as sitting skills improved.                                         Conclusion:               In children with MD, object permanence, as quantified by the OPS, emerges in conjunction with sitting skill.},

  abstract = {The causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease are unknown. Furthermore, treatment for two of these conditions is almost totally lacking. The thesis is presented that each of these disorders is due to lack of a disorder-specific neurotrophic hormone. The hormone would be elaborated or stored in the target of the affected neurons. It would be released by the postsynaptic cell and then exert its effects in a retrograde fashion after being taken up by the presynaptic terminal. In the lower motor neuron syndromes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, failure of muscle cells to release the appropriate motor neurotrophic hormone would result in impaired function of anterior horn cells. In Parkinson disease, the neurotrophic failure would be characterized by inability of striatal cells to provide the required dopamine neurotrophic hormone with resulting impairment of substantia nigra cells. In Alzheimer disease, the abnormalities would lie in failure of the hippocampus and cortical cells to supply the relevant cholinergic neurotrophic hormone with resulting impairment of medial septal and nucleus basalis neurons. Central nervous system tissue culture provides a convenient system in which to assay these neurotrophic hormones and should permit a test of the hypothesis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Clinical diagnostic criteria for both Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been recently updated. These criteria result in overlap between individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease and those with dementia with Lewy bodies. Although clinical features and symptomatic treatment overlap, differences remain in epidemiology and expected progression. The high prevalence of cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease supports regular screening for cognitive changes and counseling patients and families regarding what to expect. Treatment for Lewy body dementia involves avoiding medications that may cause or exacerbate symptoms; prescribing pharmacologic agents to address bothersome cognitive, behavioral, movement, and other nonmotor symptoms; recommending physical exercise and therapy; and providing education, counseling, caregiver support, and palliative care.                                         SUMMARY               Lewy body dementia includes both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, overlapping clinicopathologic entities with differences relating to diagnosis and expected progression. Treatment is symptomatic and thus largely overlapping for the two conditions.},

  abstract = {The dominant characteristics of the human foot are its shock-absorbing capability during walking or gait cycle and its adaptation to uneven surfaces. On the stance phase of the gait, the foot has to be flexible at first for shock absorption and adapt to the terrain; whereas, during the propulsive phase, it has to be dynamically rigid to function as a lever. Foot flexibility and rigidity are mainly controlled at the subtalar and midtarsal joints by tendons and ligaments. The subtalar joint is part of the longitudinal arch, but the midtarsal joint along with the tarsometatarsal joint are components of the transverse arch. However, the existence and functional role of transverse arch in human was challenged by some authors. But recent studies have revealed that the transverse arch has a predominant role in midfoot stiffness (Venkadeshan et al., 2020, \& Holowoka et al., 2017). This midfoot stiffness allows the human foot to store elastic energy at the time of heel strike, which is utilized during the push-off mechanism for propulsion, thus making bipedalism more energy-efficient. Moreover, the transverse arch allows the longitudinal arch to be flexible like a lever and, at the same time, makes the arch of the foot rigid to behave like a stiff spring lever. Understanding the role of the transverse arch is obligatory to study the biomechanics of foot injuries and Charcot or diabetic foot. Studies on diabetic foot have shown that the modulation of transverse arch biomechanics and off-loading modalities would improve outcomes in the form of wound-healing and prevention of re-ulceration.},

Although much is known about the tissue, research has had little success in elucidating the pathogenesis of generalised osteoarthritis. A new hypothesis is required. Substantial changes in many tissues, including bone, muscle, ligaments, and joint capsule, as well as cartilage, are increasingly recognised in this disease, and not all these changes are localised to the affected joints. There is also a well established link with obesity. These observations, the common origins of the mesenchymal cells that maintain these tissues, and the possible role of neuroendocrine factors that can regulate bone mass, result in the hypothesis that systemic factors that include altered lipid metabolism could explain the diversity of physiological changes in generalised osteoarthritis. If proven, this hypothesis could have important implications for a new approach to pharmacological intervention in the early stages of the disease.},

Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL particles, which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD. The totality of available evidence does~not support further limiting the intake of such foods.},

One of the main consequences of this controversy is that the position defended in the classical ANOVA texts on the hypothesis of the significance of the random effect is not the same as that defended in almost all of the professional statistical software programs. METHOD: In this paper, we deal with a detailed analysis about the controversy of mixed model and the decision about one of two basic options, the non restrictive and the restrictive model. RESULTS: Three key questions we consider to go beyond the controversy are: (1) the two classical models are equivalent, (2) the marginality principle do not allow to test main effects in presence of interactive significant effects and (3) the relevance of linear mixed approach to analyze models with fixed and random effects. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the simple solution of using the mixed linear approach with REML estimation instead of the classical linear approach, which is really unapplicable in this context.},

RECENT FINDINGS               As more patients are becoming therapeutically immunosuppressed, human herpesvirus infections are increasingly common. Historically, infections with human herpesviruses were described as temporal lobe encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2. More recently, however, additional pathogens, such as varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6 have been identified to cause serious neurologic infections. As literature emerges, clinical presentations of herpesvirus infections have taken on many new forms, becoming heterogeneous and involving nearly every location along the neuraxis. Advanced diagnostic methods are now available for each specific pathogen in the herpesvirus family. As data emerge on viral resistance to conventional therapies, newer antiviral medications must be considered.                                         SUMMARY               Infections from the herpesvirus family can have devastating neurologic outcomes without prompt and appropriate treatment. Clinical recognition of symptoms and appropriate advanced testing are necessary to correctly identify the infectious etiology. Knowledge of secondary neurologic complications of disease is equally important to prevent additional morbidity and mortality. This article discusses infections of the central and peripheral nervous systems caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6. The pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentations of disease, diagnostic investigations, imaging characteristics, and treatment for each infectious etiology are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglyceride had an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) events and received the greatest benefit with fibrate therapy in substudy analyses of the Helsinki Heart Study and the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this post hoc analysis of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, which enrolled patients with elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and CHD, subgroups defined by HDL-C and triglyceride quartiles were compared to examine the influence of HDL-C and triglyceride on CHD events and response to therapy. Patients in the lowest HDL-C ({$<$}1.00 mmol/L [39 mg/dL]) and highest triglyceride ({$>$}1.80 mmol/L [159 mg/dL]) quartiles (lipid triad; n=458) had increased proportions of other features of the metabolic syndrome (increased body mass index, hypertension, diabetes), men, prior myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, and beta-blocker use than patients in the highest HDL-C ({$>$}1.34 mmol/L [52 mg/dL]) and lowest triglyceride ({$<$}1.11 mmol/L [98 mg/dL]) quartiles (isolated LDL-C elevation; n=545). The major coronary event rate was highest in lipid triad patients on placebo (35.9\%), and this subgroup had the greatest event reduction (relative risk 0.48, 95\% CI 0.33 to 0.69); a significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction (P=0.03) indicated a greater treatment effect in the lipid triad subgroup than the isolated LDL-C elevation subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with elevated LDL-C, low HDL-C, and elevated triglycerides were more likely than patients with isolated LDL-C elevation to have other characteristics of the metabolic syndrome, had increased risk for CHD events on placebo, and received greater benefit with simvastatin therapy.},

This article contextualizes health disparities as they relate to the neurodegenerative processes of ADRD.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Older adults' life expectancy has increased such that a 65-year-old is expected to live 19 or more years and an 85-year-old can expect to live, on average, 6 to 7 years longer. Individuals of certain ethnoracial groups (Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) may be at a higher risk of incident ADRD compared to non-Hispanic/Latino White people. These differences in a higher risk of ADRD across ethnoracial groups persist despite no statistically significant differences in the rate of cognitive decline over time. The intersectionality of social determinants of health, experiences with discrimination and oppression, and access to care are related to the issue of justice and the risk for and expression of ADRD. The theoretical frameworks of various health disparities provide organized approaches to tracking the progression of health disparities for diverse patients.                                         SUMMARY               ADRD health disparities are complex.

Studies indicate that a generic cognitive neurologic evaluation does not reliably detect spatial neglect, nor does it identify unawareness of deficit after right brain stroke; this article reviews the symptoms, clinical presentation, and management of these two cognitive disorders occurring after right brain stroke.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Stroke and occupational therapy practice guidelines stress a quality standard for spatial neglect assessment and treatment to reduce adverse outcomes for patients, their families, and society. Neurologists may attribute poor outcomes associated with spatial neglect to stroke severity. However, people with spatial neglect are half as likely to return to home and community, have one-third the community mobility, and require 3 times as much caregiver supervision compared with similar stroke survivors. Multiple randomized trials support a feasible first-line rehabilitation approach for spatial neglect: prism adaptation therapy; more than 20 studies reported that this treatment improves daily life independence. Evidence-based treatment of anosognosia is not as developed; however, treatment for this problem is also available.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited research supporting optimal respiratory physiotherapy or physical rehabilitation strategies for patients with rib fractures. The aim of this study was to develop key recommendations for the physiotherapy management of patients with rib fractures. METHODS: A three-round modified e-Delphi survey design, using an international Delphi panel including physiotherapy clinicians, researchers and lecturers, physician associates, trauma surgeons, and intensivists, was used in this study. The draft recommendations were developed by the Steering Group, based on available research. Over three rounds, panelists rated their agreement (using a Likert scale) with regard to recommendation for physiotherapists delivering respiratory physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation to patients following rib fractures. Recommendations were retained if they achieved consensus (defined as {$\geq$}70\% of panelists {$\geq$}5/7) at the end of each round. RESULTS: A total of 121 participants from 18 countries registered to participate in the study, with 87 (72\%), 77 (64\%), and 79 (65\%) registrants completing the three rounds, respectively. The final guidance document included 18 respiratory physiotherapy and rehabilitation recommendations, mapped over seven clinical scenarios for patients (1) not requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) requiring mechanical ventilation, (3) with no concurrent fracture of the shoulder girdle complex, (4) with a concurrent fracture of the shoulder girdle complex, (5) with/without concurrent upper limb orthopedic injuries, (6) undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures, and (7) at hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: This guidance provides key recommendations for respiratory physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation of patients with rib fractures. It could also be used to inform future research priorities in the field. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV.},

Key aspects of the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms, treatment and rehabilitation, and recovery from concussion/mild TBI are reviewed with an emphasis on the variety of factors that may contribute to cognitive concerns following injury.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms that occur in the immediate aftermath of an applied force and in the hours, days, and weeks thereafter. Although advances have been made in advanced diagnostics, including neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in hopes of developing objective indicators of injury, such markers currently lack sufficient specificity to be used in clinical diagnostics. The symptoms of concussion are heterogeneous and may be seen to form subtypes, each of which suggests a targeted rehabilitation by the interdisciplinary team. Although the majority of patients with concussion recover within the first 30 to 90 days after injury, some have persistent disabling symptoms. The concept of                 postconcussion syndrome                 , implying a chronic syndrome of injury-specific symptoms, is replaced by a broader concept of                 persistent symptoms after concussion                 . This concept emphasizes the fact that most persistent symptoms have their basis in complex somatic, cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial factors related to risk and resilience. This framework leads to the important conclusion that concussion is a treatable injury from which nearly all patients can be expected to recover.                                                        SUMMARY               Concussion/mild TBI is a significant public health problem in civilian, military, and organized athletic settings. Recent advances have led to a better understanding of underlying pathophysiology and symptom presentation and efficacious treatment and rehabilitation of the resulting symptoms. An interdisciplinary team is well-positioned to provide problem-oriented, integrated care to facilitate recovery and to advance the evidence base supporting effective practice in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.},

This article provides the tools to diagnose and manage patients with autism spectrum disorder.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous condition with varying presentations, multiple etiologies, and a number of comorbidities that impact the course and management of the disorder. This article defines the core features of social communication deficits, including problems with social reciprocity, decreased nonverbal communication, and difficulties in developing and maintaining relationships. The second domain of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests, which includes the presence of stereotyped behaviors or speech, insistence on sameness and behavioral rigidity, intense or out of the ordinary interests, and unusual responses to sensory stimulation, is also delineated. Comorbidities commonly seen with autism spectrum disorder include medical, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions. Despite intense research efforts, the etiology of autism spectrum disorder remains unknown in most cases, but it is clear that a strong genetic component exists that interacts with various environmental risk factors. Current research is identifying overlapping neurobiological pathways that are involved in pathogenesis. Treatment involves intensive behavioral therapy and educational programming along with traditional ancillary services, such as speech/language, occupational, and physical therapies. Psychopharmacologic treatments are also used to target certain symptoms and comorbid conditions.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists can play an important role in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder according to clinical criteria through a comprehensive evaluation that includes a thorough medical and developmental history, behavioral and play observations, and a review of standardized cognitive and language evaluations. Neurologists are also responsible for investigating etiologies, recommending and advocating for appropriate behavioral and educational interventions, and identifying and often managing comorbidities.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Rehabilitation is an important aspect of the continuum of care in stroke. With advances in the acute treatment of stroke, more patients will survive stroke with varying degrees of disability. Research in the past decade has expanded our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stroke recovery and has led to the development of new treatment modalities. This article reviews and summarizes the key concepts related to poststroke recovery.                                         Recent Findings:               Good data now exist by which one can predict recovery, especially motor recovery, very soon after stroke onset. Recent trials have not demonstrated a clear benefit associated with very early initiation of rehabilitative therapy after stroke in terms of improvement in poststroke outcomes. However, growing evidence suggests that shorter and more frequent sessions of therapy can be safely started in the first 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. The optimal amount or dose of therapy for stroke remains undetermined, as more intensive treatments have not been associated with better outcomes compared to standard intensities of therapy. Poststroke depression adversely affects recovery across a variety of measures and is an important target for therapy. Additionally, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appears to benefit motor recovery through pleiotropic mechanisms beyond their antidepressant effect. Other pharmacologic approaches also appear to have a benefit in stroke rehabilitation.                                         Summary:               A comprehensive rehabilitation program is essential to optimize poststroke outcomes. Rehabilitation is a process that uses three major principles of recovery: adaptation, restitution, and neuroplasticity. Based on these principles, multiple different approaches, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, exist to enhance rehabilitation. In addition to neurologists, a variety of health care professionals are involved in stroke rehabilitation. Successful rehabilitation involves understanding the natural history of stroke recovery and a multidisciplinary approach with judicious use of resources to identify and treat common poststroke sequelae.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Functional neuroimaging studies have elucidated the areas involved in central control of autonomic function in humans. Optogenetic and other novel approaches in animal experiments have provided new insights into the role of these areas in autonomic control across behavioral states, including stress and the sleep-wake cycle.                                         SUMMARY               Control of the function of the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system functions depends on complex interactions at all levels of the neuraxis. Peripheral sympathetic outputs are critical for maintenance of blood pressure, thermoregulation, and response to stress. Parasympathetic reflexes control lacrimation, salivation, pupil response to light, beat-to-beat control of the heart rate, gastrointestinal motility, micturition, and erectile function. The insular cortex, anterior and midcingulate cortex, and amygdala generate autonomic responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. Several nuclei of the hypothalamus generate coordinated patterns of autonomic responses to internal or social stressors. Several brainstem nuclei participate in integrated control of autonomic function in relationship to respiration and the sleep-wake cycle. Disorders affecting the central or peripheral autonomic pathways, or both, manifest with autonomic failure (including orthostatic hypotension, anhidrosis, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and neurogenic bladder or erectile dysfunction) or autonomic hyperactivity, primary hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperhidrosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maintaining neutral spinal alignment is considered important when performing the barbell back squat exercise. Since male and female lifters may differ in injury location it is important to examine whether they differ in spinal alignment during the back squat. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to quantify the spinal alignment in the upper and lower lumbar spine during the barbell back squat exercise in male and female lifters. Secondary aims were to compare alignment during the back squat to standing habitual lumbar spine alignment and determine whether male and female lifters differ in these aspects. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, Cross-sectional. METHODS: Competitive power- and weightlifters were recruited and performed three repetitions of the barbell back squat exercise using a load equivalent to 70\% of their one-repetition maximum. Spinal alignment and range of motion were measured using inertial measurement units placed on the thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine. Data was presented descriptively and comparisons between men and women as well as spinal alignment in four different positions were done with a factorial repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Twenty-three (14 males, 9 females) were included. During execution of the squat, spinal alignment adjustments in the lumbar spine were made in all three planes of movement, compared to the start position, in both male and female lifters. Compared to their standing habitual posture, all lifters adjusted their upper lumbar spine to a less lordotic position when in the start position of the back squat (standing upright with the barbell on their back). Only male lifters assumed a less lordotic alignment in their lower lumbar spine in the start position compared their habitual posture. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustments of spinal alignment, predominantly in the sagittal plane, are made during execution of the back squat in both male and female lifters. Further, lifters adopt a less lordotic alignment with a heavy barbell on their upper back, more so in male than female lifters. In conclusion, it seems that spinal alignment changes noticeably during the barbell back squat. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3{\textcopyright}The Author(s).},

Initial emphasis is placed on clinical history, examination, diagnostic testing, and medical decision making, while subsequent focus is placed on examining specific inflammatory optic neuropathies. Clinical clues, examination findings, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing that differentiate autoimmune, granulomatous, demyelinating, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes of optic neuritis are assessed, and current treatments are evaluated.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in technology and immunology have enhanced our understanding of the pathologies driving inflammatory optic nerve injury. Clinicians are now able to interrogate optic nerve structure and function during inflammatory injury, rapidly identify disease-relevant autoimmune targets, and deliver timely therapeutics to improve visual outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Optic neuritis is a common clinical manifestation of central nervous system inflammation. Depending on the etiology, visual prognosis and the risk for recurrent injury may vary. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of optic neuritis may be critical for limiting vision loss, future neurologic disability, and organ damage. This article will aid neurologists in formulating a systematic approach to patients with optic neuritis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The increased use of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy to treat autoimmune diseases has led to an increase in opportunistic neurologic infections. The description of numerous causes of autoimmune antibody{\textendash}mediated encephalitis over the past decade has expanded the differential diagnosis of encephalitis beyond infection. The emergence of metagenomic next-generation sequencing has led to diagnoses of rare or unexpected causes of neurologic infections and has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision in neuroinfectious diseases.                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the nervous system can affect any level of the neuraxis and present over any time course. Neurologic infections may present atypically with respect to clinical, radiologic, and CSF analysis features in immunocompromised patients or older adults. A thorough evaluation including systemic features, past medical history, travel, exposures, detailed examination, neuroimaging, and CSF analysis is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. It is important to be aware of the test characteristics and limitations of microbiological tests on CSF for neurologic infections to avoid being misled by false positives or false negatives.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Tetanus is most common in lower-income settings, but rare cases are seen in higher-income settings because of the inadequate maintenance of vaccination status. Foodborne botulism remains rare, but botulism can also be caused by IV drug use (wound botulism) and medical use of botulinum toxin (iatrogenic botulism); botulinum toxin has also been considered a potential agent of bioterrorism. Diphtheric neuropathy is rare but has been seen in recent epidemics in the former Soviet Union, and vaccination status is inadequate in a significant proportion of older individuals, creating the potential for subsequent epidemics.                                         SUMMARY               Tetanus, botulism, and diphtheric neuropathy are rare in higher-resource settings where most neurologists practice; however, familiarity with the unique clinical manifestations of and laboratory evaluation for these disorders is essential for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of patients with these conditions.},

  abstract = {Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged {$\geq$}18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45{\textdegree} to one side and neck extended 20{\textdegree} with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.},

This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of infections of the spine and spinal cord to help practicing clinicians recognize, evaluate, and manage patients with such infections.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Aging of the population, increasing use of immunosuppressive medications, and other factors have contributed to increasing rates of spinal infections. Although the most common agents responsible for spinal infections remain bacteria and viruses, fungal infections occur in individuals who are immunocompromised, and parasitic infections are common in endemic regions, but patterns are in evolution with migration and climate change. Recent outbreaks of acute flaccid myelitis in children have been associated with enteroviruses A71 and D68.                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the spine and spinal cord can be challenging to diagnose, requiring a thorough history and neurologic examination, laboratory studies of serum and CSF, neuroimaging (particularly MRI), and, in some instances, biopsy, to establish a diagnosis and treatment regimen.

Recent articles disagree on whether to continue using these percentage agreement measures, and on which ones to use, and what to do about chance agreements if their use is continued. Much of the disagreement derives from the need to be reasonably certain we do not accept as evidence of true interobserver agreement those agreement levels which are substantially probable as a result of chance observer agreement. The various percentage agreement measures are shown to be adequate to this task, but easier ways are discussed. Tables are given to permit checking to see if obtained disagreements are unlikely due to chance. Particularly important is the discovery of a simple rule that, when met, makes the tables unnecessary. If reliability checks using 50 or more observation occasions produce 10\% or fewer disagreements, for behavior rates from 10\% through 90\%, the agreement achieved is quite improbably the result of chance agreement.},

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from January 1960 to February 2004, EMBASE from January 1991 to February 2004, clinical experts, bibliographies, and abstracts. Search terms included trial terms: randomized-controlled trial or controlled-clinical trial or random-allocation or double-blind method, or single-blind method or uncontrolled-trials with vitamin D terms: cholecalciferol or hydroxycholecalciferols or calcifediol or dihydroxycholecalciferols or calcitriol or vitamin D/aa[analogs \& derivates] or ergocalciferol or vitamin D/bl[blood]; and with accidental falls or falls, and humans. STUDY SELECTION: We included only double-blind randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D in elderly populations (mean age, 60 years) that examined falls resulting from low trauma for which the method of fall ascertainment and definition of falls were defined explicitly. Studies including patients in unstable health states were excluded. Five of 38 identified studies were included in the primary analysis and 5 other studies were included in a sensitivity analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent extraction by 3 authors using predefined data fields including study quality indicators. DATA SYNTHESIS: Based on 5 RCTs involving 1237 participants, vitamin D reduced the corrected odds ratio (OR) of falling by 22\% (corrected OR, 0.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.92) compared with patients receiving calcium or placebo. From the pooled risk difference, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 15 (95\% CI, 8-53), or equivalently 15 patients would need to be treated with vitamin D to prevent 1 person from falling. The inclusion of 5 additional studies, involving 10 001 participants, in a sensitivity analysis resulted in a smaller but still significant effect size (corrected RR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.96). Subgroup analyses suggested that the effect size was independent of calcium supplementation, type of vitamin D, duration of therapy, and sex, but reduced sample sizes made the results statistically nonsignificant for calcium supplementation, cholecalciferol, and among men. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation appears to reduce the risk of falls among ambulatory or institutionalized older individuals with stable health by more than 20\%. Further studies examining the effect of alternative types of vitamin D and their doses, the role of calcium supplementation, and effects in men should be considered.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The identification of central sensitization (CS) is an important aspect in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Several methods have been developed, including clinical indicators and psychophysical measures. However, whether clinical indicators coincide with the psychophysical test of CS-related sign and symptoms is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical indicators in identifying CS-related sign and symptoms in patients with musculoskeletal pain.                                         Methods               One-hundred consecutive patients with musculoskeletal pain were included. Clinical indicators (index method) based on a combination of patient self-report pain characteristics and physical examination were used to identify the phenotype of patients with musculoskeletal pain and the predominance of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was assessed by the Cold Pressor Test (reference standard), which is a psychophysical test used to detect impairment of CPM. Measurements of the diagnostic accuracy were performed.                                         Results               Twenty-seven patients presented predominance of CS-related sign and symptoms in the assessment of the clinical indicators, and 20 had impairment of CPM. Clinical indicators showed high accuracy (75.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,65.3 to 83.1), high specificity (80.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,69.6 to 88.1), high negative predictive value (87.7\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,81.2 to 92.1), and a relevant positive likelihood ratio (2.8, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.5 to 5.0) when compared to the Cold Pressor Test.                                         Conclusion               Clinical indicators demonstrated a valuable tool for detecting the impaired CPM, which is a remarkable feature of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Clinicians are encouraged to use the clinical indicators in the management of patients with musculoskeletal pain.},

It is also a valuable resource for advanced medical students and residents, as well as students of other health professions ranging from physical therapy to dentistry. This book brings a pioneering interactive approach to the teaching of neuroanatomy and comprises 19 chapters that explain the major neuroanatomical systems. Each chapter first presents background material-including an overview of relevant neuroanatomical structures and pathways-and a brief discussion of related clinical disorders. The second half of each chapter is devoted to clinical cases. The cases begin with a narrative of how the patient developed symptoms and what deficits were found on neurological examination. A series of questions challenges the reader to deduce the neuroanatomical location of the patient's lesion and the diagnosis. Discussion and answers follow, revealing the actual outcome. This third edition is fully updated with the latest advances in the field and includes several new cases and enhanced online and digital components"},

A particular focus is on improving diagnostic accuracy to reduce the arduous diagnostic odyssey that so many patients and families endure. Strategies to promote diagnostic accuracy and approach the management of problematic symptoms are also discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although the International Consensus Criteria for bvFTD were published more than a decade ago and clinicopathologic studies have confirmed their utility, diagnostic confusion continues. This article presents updated data along with illustrative cases to emphasize the clinical pearls that are most useful for clinicians. Although accurate prediction of the underlying proteinopathy remains a challenge, the ability to differentiate bvFTD from atypical Alzheimer disease, psychiatric disorders, and other mimickers has improved. Knowledge about the genetic underpinnings in a significant minority of individuals with familial FTLD is enabling early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutic optimism has also increased, particularly in familial FTLD, with a few clinical trials in progress and several more planned, some of which are designed to slow progression or delay the onset of symptoms, or both.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis and management of bvFTD is challenging for clinicians and particularly for patients and their families. Although much progress has been gained over recent years, several key research questions persist. Treatments that significantly improve symptoms or alter the course of FTLD remain elusive, but optimism is increasing as pathobiology is better understood and novel therapies are being developed.},

Although the International Headache Society recognises this type of headache as a distinct disorder, some clinicians remain sceptical. Laboratory and clinical studies have shown that pain from upper cervical joints and muscles can be referred to the head. Clinical diagnostic criteria have not proved valid, but a cervical source of pain can be established by use of fluoroscopically guided, controlled, diagnostic nerve blocks. In this Review, we outline the basic science and clinical evidence for cervicogenic headache and indicate how opposing approaches to its definition and diagnosis affect the evidence for its clinical management. We provide recommendations that enable a pragmatic approach to the diagnosis and management of probable cervicogenic headache, as well as a rigorous approach to the diagnosis and management of definite cervical headache.},

Targeted therapies, once few in number with limited penetration into the CNS, have multiplied in number and increased in CNS coverage. This article addresses recent advances in the evaluation and clinical management of patients with CNS metastasis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Metastasis of cancer to the CNS can be diagnosed and characterized with novel techniques, including molecular analyses of the spinal fluid, so-called                 liquid biopsies                 . Resected parenchymal CNS metastases are now routinely subjected to genomic sequencing. For patients with CNS metastases displaying targetable mutations, a wide variety of treatment options are available, including deferral of radiation therapy in favor of a trial of an orally bioavailable targeted therapy or immunotherapy. For patients without a molecularly targetable lesion, local treatment in the form of radiation therapy, now most often stereotactic radiosurgery, is supplanting untargeted whole-brain radiation therapy.

OBJECTIVES: To validate the measurement of the pectoralis minor muscle length using palpable landmarks and to explore the accuracy of the measurement using a clinical instrument. BACKGROUND: The pectoralis minor is believed to adaptively shorten. Individuals with a relatively short pectoralis minor demonstrate scapular kinematic alterations that have been associated with shoulder impingement. METHODS AND MEASURES: A 3-dimensional electromagnetic motion capture system was used to calculate the length of the pectoralis minor in 11 cadavers, using 2 measurement techniques. In addition, a measurement with the electromagnetic system using palpable landmarks was compared to a measurement with both a caliper and tape measure in vivo. RESULTS: In cadavers, a measurement using palpable landmarks was determined to be a valid measure of the actual muscle length visualized and measured following dissection. There was a high intraclass correlation coefficient and a small root-mean-square error between these 2 measures. High intraclass correlation coefficients were also calculated in vivo when measurements with the clinical instruments were compared with the electromagnetic device measures. CONCLUSION: A measurement using palpable landmarks for pectoralis minor length validly represents the muscle length in cadavers. A caliper or tape measure may be used clinically with high accuracy and may help clinicians determine the need for and the effectiveness of interventions for lengthening this muscle.},

This article covers the salient features of the migraine postdrome and provides insight into the history, clinical symptoms, and future implications of this phase of migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective electronic diary studies have shown that patients are left disabled with various nonheadache symptoms in the migraine postdrome, and 81\% of patients report at least one nonheadache symptom in the postdrome. Hence, it is important to understand this phase better and ensure that more effective treatments become available in the future to lessen the morbidity associated with this phase. Functional imaging shows widespread reduction in brain-blood flow in the postdrome, which explains the multitudes of symptoms experienced by patients.                                         SUMMARY               The disability related to migraine is not exclusive to the headache phase but extends into the postdrome phase and is associated with several nonheadache symptoms that prolong the symptoms experienced by patients with migraine. Further research into the postdrome is crucial to improve our overall understanding of migraine mechanisms. This knowledge may also help to treat the concurrent nonheadache symptoms better in the future. Novel neuroimaging techniques provide a valuable noninvasive tool to push the frontiers in the understanding of migraine pathophysiology. These methods may help shed further light onto the possible links between key brain structures and networks that could be implicated in the pathophysiology of the various migraine phases.},

An outline of the history and controversy surrounding how these disorders are classified is provided before the article focuses on each disorder's clinical and imaging features.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past decade, the classification of degenerative speech and language disorders has been refined. Clinical, imaging, and pathologic evidence suggests that primary progressive apraxia of speech is a distinct degenerative disorder. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence have highlighted issues with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, which complicates the diagnosis, prognosis, and study of this disorder. Semantic variant PPA, while not without controversy, remains one of the most well-defined disorders, with good clinicopathologic correlation.                                         SUMMARY               Accurate classification and diagnosis of these degenerative speech and language disorders is crucial in clinical practice and ongoing research efforts. For nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, the authors suggest emphasizing agrammatism as the core inclusion criterion and taking care not to include patients with isolated or predominant apraxia of speech. Isolated apraxia of speech can be the manifestation of a degenerative disease and, based on the different prognosis, should be recognized as distinct from PPA. Finally, it is important to recognize that some patients with semantic dementia, despite sharing the same pathologic associations, may not meet criteria for PPA.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The contribution of rods and cones to the pupillary light reflex has long been known. A third photosensitive cell type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell, has recently been discovered. This cell type employs melanopsin to mediate a portion of the pupillary light reflex independent of rods and cones (the postillumination pupillary response) and photic regulation of circadian rhythm.                                         SUMMARY               The autonomic nervous system regulates pupil size in response to stimuli. The parasympathetic nervous system causes miosis in response to light and near visual stimuli. These stimuli activate supranuclear pathways that project to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei. The sympathetic nervous system causes mydriasis in response to a variety of arousing factors, both physiologic (wakefulness) and pathologic (pain). Abnormalities of physiologic function cause disturbances of pupil size, shape, and response to stimuli. The clinical approach to pupillary abnormalities should focus on the clinical and pharmacologic assessment of the pupil's expected response to diverse stimuli.},

The objective of this review was to describe state-of-the-art golf swing biomechanics, with a specific emphasis on movement kinematics, and when possible, to suggest recommendations for research methodologies. Keywords related to biomechanics and golf swings were used in scientific databases. Only articles that focused on golf-swing kinematics were considered. In this review, 92 articles were considered and categorized into the following domains: X-factor, crunch factor, swing plane and clubhead trajectory, kinematic sequence, and joint angular kinematics. The main subjects of focus were male golfers. Performance parameters were searched for, but the lack of methodological consensus prevented generalization of the results and led to contradictory results. Currently, three-dimensional approaches are commonly used for joint angular kinematic investigations. However, recommendations by the International Society of Biomechanics are rarely considered.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, muscle synergies analysis has been commonly used to assess the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying human motor control. Several synergy models and algorithms have been employed for processing the electromyographic (EMG) signal, and it has been shown that the coordination of motor control is characterized by the presence of phasic (movement-related) and tonic (anti-gravity and related to co-contraction) EMG components. Neural substrates indicate that phasic and tonic components have non-homogeneous origin; however, it is still unclear if these components are generated by the same set of synergies or by distinct synergies. This study aims at testing whether phasic and tonic components are generated by distinct phasic and tonic synergies or by the same set of synergies with phasic and tonic activation coefficients. The study also aims at characterizing the differences between the phasic and the tonic synergies. Using a comprehensive mapping of upper-limb point-to-point movements, synergies were extracted from phasic and tonic EMG signal separately, estimating the tonic components with a linear ramp model. The goodness of reconstruction (R2) as a function of the number of synergies was compared, and sets of synergies extracted from each dataset at three R2 threshold levels (0.80, 0.85, 0.90) were retained for further analysis. Then, shared, phasic-specific, and tonic-specific synergies were extracted from the two datasets concatenated. The dimensionality of the synergies shared between the phasic and the tonic datasets was estimated with a bootstrap procedure based on the evaluation of the distribution of principal angles between the subspaces spanned by phasic and tonic synergies due to noise. We found only few shared synergies, indicating that phasic and tonic synergies have in general different structures. To compare consistent differences in synergy composition, shared, phasic-specific, and tonic-specific synergies were clustered separately. Phasic-specific clusters were more numerous than tonic-specific ones, suggesting that they were more differentiated among subjects. The structure of phasic clusters and the higher sparseness indicated that phasic synergies capture specific muscle activation patterns related to the movement while tonic synergies show co-contraction of multiple muscles for joint stabilization and holding postures. These results suggest that in many scenarios phasic and tonic synergies should be extracted separately, especially when performing muscle synergy analysis in patients with abnormal tonic activity and for tuning devices with gravity support.},

We use "medical care" rather than "health care" to refer to clinical services, to avoid potential confusion between "health" and "health care." The World Health Organization's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health has defined SDH as "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age" and "the fundamental drivers of these conditions." The term "social determinants" often evokes factors such as health-related features of neighborhoods (e.g., walkability, recreational areas, and accessibility of healthful foods), which can influence health-related behaviors. Evidence has accumulated, however, pointing to socioeconomic factors such as income, wealth, and education as the fundamental causes of a wide range of health outcomes. This article broadly reviews some of the knowledge accumulated to date that highlights the importance of social-and particularly socioeconomic-factors in shaping health, and plausible pathways and biological mechanisms that may explain their effects. We also discuss challenges to advancing this knowledge and how they might be overcome.},

Examples include residential segregation, unfair lending practices and other barriers to home ownership and accumulating wealth, schools' dependence on local property taxes, environmental injustice, biased policing and sentencing of men and boys of color, and voter suppression policies. This article defines systemic and structural racism, using examples; explains how they damage health through many causal pathways; and suggests approaches to dismantling them.

Recently, the first description of the reversal of cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease or its precursors, MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and SCI (subjective cognitive impairment), was published [1]. The therapeutic approach used was programmatic and personalized rather than monotherapeutic and invariant, and was dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND). Patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work, and those struggling at work were able to improve their performance. The patients, their spouses, and their co-workers all reported clear improvements. Here we report the results from quantitative MRI and neuropsychological testing in ten patients with cognitive decline, nine ApoE4+ (five homozygous and four heterozygous) and one ApoE4-, who were treated with the MEND protocol for 5-24 months. The magnitude of the improvement is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective. These results have far-reaching implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, MCI, and SCI; for personalized programs that may enhance pharmaceutical efficacy; and for personal identification of ApoE genotype.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of neuroimmune disorders of the central nervous system is rapidly expanding. Several clinical and paraclinical factors help to inform the diagnosis and ultimately the suspicion for a monophasic versus relapsing course, including the age of the patient (prepubertal versus postpubertal), presence or absence of clinical encephalopathy, identification of serum autoantibodies (eg, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG] and aquaporin-4), presence of intrathecally unique oligoclonal bands, and location/extent of radiologic abnormalities. Collaborative international research efforts have facilitated understanding of the safety and efficacy of currently available immunotherapies in children with acquired demyelinating disorders, particularly multiple sclerosis.                                         SUMMARY               Although many of the demyelinating disorders presented in this article can affect children and adults across the age spectrum, the clinical and radiologic phenotypes, treatment considerations, and long-term prognoses are often distinct in children.},

Recent research on ACLR warrants a reexamination of clinicians' current rehabilitation practices to optimize the strikingly variable clinical outcomes after ACLR and return to sport. The purpose of the article and updated guidelines is to use contemporary evidence to systematically revisit our practice guidelines and validate our clinical milestones with data from our university-based practice. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Using the PubMed search engine, articles that reported on ACLR rehabilitation and protocols, guidelines, graft type, healing and strain, return to sport, psychological considerations, and secondary injury prevention published from 1979 to 2020 were identified using the search terms ACLR protocols, guidelines, ACLR rehabilitation, ACL graft, ACL open kinetic chain (OKC) exercise and closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise, ACLR return to sport, ACLR psychological factors, and ACL injury prevention. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: Clinical milestones after ACLR were validated using clinical data collected from 2013 to 2017 at a university-based practice. Variables including knee joint range of motion, effusion, Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale, and quadriceps strength index were tracked throughout rehabilitation and analyzed to help inform an updated ACLR rehabilitation guideline. CONCLUSION: Incorporating the latest research, combined with direct clinical data, provides a current, realistic, and clinically benchmarked strategy for ACLR rehabilitation. Commonly held clinical beliefs regarding rehabilitation after ACL injury must be challenged by the latest research to improve patient outcomes and decrease the risk of reinjury. Key updates to the practice guidelines include the use of frequent and accurate quadriceps strength testing, delayed return-to-sport timeline, immediate use of open kinetic chain exercise, criterion-based progressions for running, sprinting, plyometrics, agility, cutting/pivoting, return to competition, and the inclusion of a secondary prevention program after return to sport.

The scope of this guideline contains nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, including surgical procedures less invasive than knee arthroplasty.

This guideline contains 29 recommendations to assist all qualified and appropriately trained healthcare professionals involved in the nonarthroplasty management of osteoarthritis of the knee and provide information for patients. In addition, the work group highlighted the need for better research into intra-articular corticosteroid, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma detailing osteoarthritis characterization, including subgroup analyses and osteoarthrosis severity stratification, and clinically relevant outcomes with control subjects for bias and cost-effectiveness analysis. Studies comparing outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis and an MRI confirmed meniscal tear who have undergone partial meniscectomy after failing to improve with a course of conservative treatment (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injection, and physical therapy) versus those who have undergone partial meniscectomy without a dedicated course of conservative treatment. Prospective randomized trials or prospective cohort studies are still needed to establish efficacy of individual oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within specific subgroups and populations to tailor systemic medications to help increase efficacy and decrease the risk of adverse effects.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The clinical diagnosis of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is based on 3 tests: anterior drawer, pivot shift and Lachman. The latter is the most commonly used test. The "lever sign" is a new clinical test that was first described by Lelli et al. in 2014. The primary objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of the lever sign test for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears, in the primary care setting of patients with acute knee injuries. Primary care being the first point of contact between patients and the healthcare system (general practitioners in this study). The secondary objective was to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the lever sign test, by comparing it to the PPV of the Lachman test and its sensitivity. The working hypothesis was that the sensitivity of the lever sign test was equal to or greater than 80\%. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients with ski-related knee injuries which occurred in French ski resorts between December 1, 2019, and March 15, 2020. The Lachman test and the lever sign test were performed by 36 mountain physicians and were compared to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. The lever sign test involved placing a closed fist under the patient's calf in the supine position and applying downward pressure over the quadriceps. Depending on whether the ACL was intact or not, the patient's heel would either rise off the examination table or remain still. This study included 258 patients: 190 women and 68 men. RESULTS: The MRIs found 219 ACL tears and 36 intact ACLs. Three MRIs were deemed uninterpretable. The sensitivity of the lever sign test was 61.2\% and the PPV was 83.8\%. The sensitivity of the Lachman test was 99.1\% and the PPV was 86.5\%. CONCLUSION: This study determined the sensitivity of the lever sign test for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears during real-life situations encountered by mountain physicians. This sensitivity was lower than expected. The Lachman test, on the other hand, showed a very high sensitivity. It remains the test of choice for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears in patients with knee injuries. Therefore, the lever sign test can complement the Lachman test but is not a substitute for it.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article provides an overview of preventive interventions for migraine, including when to start and how to choose a treatment, pharmacologic options (both older oral treatments and new monoclonal antibodies to calcitonin gene-related peptide [CGRP] or its receptor), nonpharmacologic treatment such as neuromodulation, and preventive treatment of refractory migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The migraine preventive treatment landscape has been transformed by the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor. These treatments, which are given subcutaneously or intravenously monthly or quarterly, have high efficacy and were well tolerated in clinical trials. Emerging real-world studies have found higher rates of adverse events than were seen in clinical trials. They are currently recommended for use if two traditional preventive therapies have proven inadequate. Since the commonly cited 2012 American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology migraine prevention guidelines were released, clinical trials supporting the preventive use of lisinopril, candesartan, and memantine have been published. Neuromodulation devices, including external trigeminal nerve stimulation and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation devices, have modest evidence to support preventive use. The American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology guidelines for the preventive treatment of migraine are currently being updated. A new class of oral CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants) is being tested for migraine prevention.                                         SUMMARY               Successful preventive treatment of migraine reduces disease burden and improves quality of life. Many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options are available for the prevention of migraine, including newer therapies aimed at the CGRP pathway as well as older treatments with good evidence for efficacy. Multiple treatment trials may be required to find the best preventive for an individual patient.},

The TACs are composed of five diseases: cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA), and hemicrania continua.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New classifications for the TACs have two important updates; chronic cluster headache is now defined as remission periods lasting less than 3 months (formerly less than 1 month), and hemicrania continua is now classified as a TAC (formerly classified as                 other primary headache                 ). The first-line treatments of TACs have not changed in recent years: cluster headache is managed with oxygen, triptans, and verapamil; paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua are managed with indomethacin; and SUNCT and SUNA are managed with lamotrigine. However, advancements in neuromodulation have recently provided additional options for patients with cluster headache, which include noninvasive devices for abortive therapy and invasive devices for refractory cluster headache. Patient selection for these devices is key.                                                        SUMMARY               The TACs are a group of diseases that appear similar to each other and to other headache disorders but have important differences. Proper diagnosis is crucial for proper treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of the TACs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical therapy intervention is often sought to treat cervical spine conditions and a comprehensive physical therapy examination has been associated with more favourable outcomes. The cervical relocation test (CRT) is one method used to assess joint position sense (PS) integrity of the cervical spine. Previous research has found significant differences in the CRT between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Impaired kinaesthetic awareness in the cervical spine may be associated with degenerative joint disease, chronicity of the complaint and increased susceptibility to re-injury. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the intertester and intratester reliability of cervical relocation using the cervical range of motion instrument (CROM) and an affixed laser (AL) device among subjects with and without a history of neck pain. In addition, it was hypothesised that those individuals with a history of neck pain would have greater difficulty on the CRT. METHODS: A total of 50 asymptomatic subjects (n\,=\,50) were assigned to two researchers. The CRT was performed for each tester by the subject rotating the cervical spine for three trials to the right and left for the CROM and AL. RESULTS: The results indicate a significant intertester reliability of the CROM (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\,=\,0.717[0.502-0.839]; 0.773[0.595-0.873]) for the subjects in this sample. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the CROM is a reliable device for measuring cervical relocation between different testers. Future research should investigate if the CRT is predictive of prognosis in patients with cervical pathology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aphasia is a common consequence of stroke, and people who live with this condition experience poor outcomes. Adherence to clinical practice guidelines can promote high-quality service delivery and optimize patient outcomes. However, there are currently no high-quality guidelines specific to post-stroke aphasia management. AIMS: To identify and evaluate recommendations from high-quality stroke guidelines that can inform aphasia management. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: We conducted an updated systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify high-quality clinical guidelines published between January 2015 and October 2022. Primary searches were performed using electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Gray literature searches were conducted using Google Scholar, guideline databases, and stroke websites. Clinical practice guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool. Recommendations were extracted from high-quality guidelines (scored\,{$>$}\,66.7\% on Domain 3: "Rigor of Development"), classified as aphasia-specific or aphasia-related, and categorized into clinical practice areas. Evidence ratings and source citations were assessed, and similar recommendations were grouped. Twenty-three stroke clinical practice guidelines were identified and 9 (39\%) met our criteria for rigor of development. From these guidelines, 82 recommendations for aphasia management were extracted: 31 were aphasia-specific, 51 aphasia-related, 67 evidence-based, and 15 consensus-based. CONCLUSION: More than half of stroke clinical practice guidelines identified did not meet our criteria for rigorous development. We identified 9 high-quality guidelines and 82 recommendations to inform aphasia management. Most recommendations were aphasia-related; aphasia-specific recommendation gaps were identified in three clinical practice areas: "accessing community supports," "return to work, leisure, driving," and "interprofessional practice."},

  abstract = {Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) causing neurogenic claudication (NC) is increasingly common with an aging population and can be associated with significant symptoms and functional limitations. We developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on nonsurgical management of patients with LSS causing NC. Using the GRADE approach, a multidisciplinary guidelines panel based recommendations on evidence from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published through June 2019, or expert consensus. The literature monitored up to October 2020. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, disability, quality of life, and walking capacity. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with LSS (congenital and/or acquired, lateral recess or central canal, with or without low back pain, with or without spondylolisthesis) causing NC. The guidelines panel developed 6 recommendations based on randomized controlled trials and 5 others based on professional consensus, summarized in 3 overarching recommendations: (Grade: statements are all conditional/weak recommendations)~Recommendation 1.~For patients with LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may initially select multimodal care nonpharmacological therapies with education, advice and lifestyle changes, behavioral change techniques in conjunction with home exercise, manual therapy, and/or rehabilitation (moderate-quality evidence), traditional acupuncture on a trial basis (very low-quality evidence), and postoperative rehabilitation (supervised program of exercises and/or educational materials encouraging activity) with cognitive-behavioral therapy 12 weeks postsurgery (low-quality evidence).~Recommendation 2.~In patients LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. (very low-quality evidence).~Recommendation 3.~For patients LSS causing NC, we recommend against the use of the following pharmacological therapies: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, methylcobalamin, calcitonin, paracetamol, opioids, muscle relaxants, pregabalin (consensus-based), gabapentin (very low-quality), and epidural steroidal injections (high-quality evidence). PERSPECTIVE: This guideline, on the basis of a systematic review of the evidence on the nonsurgical management of lumbar spine stenosis, provides recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Safe and effective non-surgical management of lumbar spine stenosis should be on the basis of a plan of care tailored to the individual and the type of treatment involved, and multimodal care is recommended in most situations.},

It is now known that understanding more about why things hurt can actually help people to overcome their pain. Recent advances in fields such as neurophysiology, brain imaging, immunology, psychology and cellular biology have provided an explanatory platform from which to explore pain. This book discusses how pain responses are produced by the brain; how responses to injury from the autonomic motor and immune systems in your body contribute to pain, and why pain can persist after tissues have had plenty of time to heal. This book, with its easy to follow language, discusses how pain experiences are constructed in response to dangers and threats in our bodies and influenced by our thoughts, beliefs and context.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Congenital muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting in hypotonia, muscle weakness, and dystrophic or myopathic features on muscle biopsy. This article summarizes the clinical and genetic aspects of these disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, diagnoses of congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy have been made by clinical features and histopathology; however, recent advances in genetics have changed diagnostic practice by relying more heavily on genetic findings. This article reviews the clinical and genetic features of the most common congenital muscular dystrophies including laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA2){\textendash}related (merosin deficient), collagen VI{\textendash}related, and {$\alpha$}-dystroglycan{\textendash}related congenital muscular dystrophies and reviews the most common congenital myopathies including nemaline rod, core, and centronuclear myopathies. With the increasing accessibility of genetic testing, the number of genes found to be associated with these disorders has increased dramatically. A wide spectrum of severity and onset (from birth to adulthood) exist across all subtypes. Progression and other features are variable depending on the subtype and severity of the specific genetic mutation.                                         SUMMARY               Congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy are increasingly recognized disorders. A growing appreciation for the breadth of phenotypic variability and overlap between established subtypes has challenged long-standing phenotypic and histopathologic classifications of these disorders but has driven a greater understanding of pathogenesis and opened the door to the development of novel treatments.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Dementia clinical syndromes are frequently caused by mixed pathologies, leading to varied clinical presentations that include memory loss, behavioral changes, communication challenges, safety concerns, and loss of independent function. Medications for treating dementia currently target cognitive and behavioral symptoms, although disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease may be making their way into widespread clinical practice soon. Identification and treatment of co-occurring medical problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea, adverse medication effects, mood disorders, hearing loss, pain, alcohol misuse, and vascular risk factors, may mitigate the impact of these conditions on cognitive decline. Mobilization of clinical and community-based interprofessional teams will ensure that people with dementia and their care partners have the expertise, support, and access to resources they need. Addressing goals of care early in the disease course will allow people with dementia to contribute to their care plan by expressing their wishes.                                         SUMMARY               Developing a structured approach to treating common causes of dementia and related comorbid medical conditions, identifying a local network of interprofessional clinical and community-based referrals, and providing readily available educational resources will help clinicians provide quality dementia care management that extends beyond the clinic visit. Encouraging patients and families to engage in clinical research will advance the identification of effective therapies, preventive strategies, and quality care models for the future.},

This paper presents the guidelines, related processes, and evidence, and elaborates upon how the guidelines can support inclusive policy, practice, and research.               Methods               : Methods were consistent with the World Health Organization protocols for developing guidelines. Systematic reviews of the evidence on physical activity for health for people living with disability were appraised, along with a consideration of the evidence used to inform the general 2020 World Health Organization guidelines.               Results               : Evidence supported the development of recommendations for people living with disability, stressing that there are no major risks to engaging in physical activity appropriate to an individual's current activity level, health status, and physical function, and that the health benefits accrued generally outweigh the risks. They also emphasize the benefits of limiting sedentary behavior.               Conclusions               : The guidelines mark a positive step forward for disability inclusion, but considerable effort is needed to advance the agenda. This paper highlights key considerations for the implementation of the new recommendations for people living with disability, in line with the human rights agenda underpinning the Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018{\textendash}2030 and allied policies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A third version of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III), made up of three subscales, was formulated following comments by experts from several countries and Rasch analysis performed on the previous version. OBJECTIVE: To examine the validity, reliability, and usefulness of SCIM III using Rasch analysis. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Thirteen spinal cord units in six countries from North America, Europe, and the Middle-East. SUBJECTS: 425 patients with spinal cord lesions (SCL). INTERVENTIONS: SCIM III assessments by professional staff members. Rasch analysis of admission scores. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SCIM III subscale match between the distribution of item difficulty grades and the patient ability measurements; reliability of patient ability measures; fit of data to Rasch model requirements; unidimensionality of each subscale; hierarchical ordering of categories within items; differential item functioning across classes of patients and across countries. RESULTS: Results supported the compatibility of the SCIM subscales with the stringent Rasch requirements. Average infit mean-square indices were 0.79-1.06; statistically distinct strata of abilities were 3 to 4; most thresholds between adjacent categories were properly ordered; item hierarchy was stable across most of the clinical subgroups and across countries. In a few items, however, misfit or category threshold disordering were found. CONCLUSIONS: The scores of each SCIM III subscale appear as a reliable and useful quantitative representation of a specific construct of independence after SCL. This justifies the use of SCIM in clinical research, including cross-cultural trials. The results also suggest that there is merit in further refining the scale.},

The article presents an evaluation strategy that highly leverages the two major classification schemes of myoclonus. The goal of this article is to link evaluation strategy with diagnosis and treatment of myoclonus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The growth of medical literature has helped better define myoclonus etiologies. Physiologic study of myoclonus types and etiologies with electrophysiologic testing has provided greater clarity to the pathophysiology of the myoclonus in various diseases. Although studies have been limited, the role of newer treatment agents and methods has made progress.                                         SUMMARY               Myoclonus has hundreds of different etiologies. Classification is necessary to evaluate myoclonus efficiently and pragmatically. The classification of myoclonus etiology, which is grouped by different clinical presentations, helps determine the etiology and treatment of the myoclonus. The classification of myoclonus physiology using electrophysiologic test results helps determine the pathophysiology of the myoclonus and can be used to strategize symptomatic treatment approaches. Both basic ancillary testing (including EEG and imaging) and more comprehensive testing may be necessary. Treatment of the underlying etiology is the ideal approach. However, if such treatment is not possible or is delayed, symptomatic treatment guided by the myoclonus physiology should be considered. More controlled study of myoclonus treatment is needed. Further research on myoclonus generation mechanisms should shed light on future treatment possibilities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determining the etiology of disorders that manifest with chronic dizziness can seem a daunting task, but extracting some basic elements of the patient's history can reduce the differential diagnosis significantly. This includes determining initial triggers, timing of symptoms, associated features, and exacerbating factors. This article covers distinct causes of chronic dizziness including persistent postural perceptual dizziness, mal de d{\'e}barquement syndrome, motion sickness and visually induced motion sickness, bilateral vestibulopathy, and persistent dizziness after mild concussion. RECENT FINDINGS: To date, none of the disorders above has a cure but are considered chronic syndromes with fluctuations that are both innate and driven by environmental stressors. As such, the mainstay of therapy for chronic disorders of dizziness involves managing factors that exacerbate symptoms and adding vestibular rehabilitation or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or in combination, as appropriate. These therapies are supplemented by serotonergic antidepressants that modulate sensory gating and reduce anxiety. Besides expectation management, ruling out concurrent disorders and recognizing behavioral and lifestyle factors that affect symptom severity are critical issues in reducing morbidity for each disorder. SUMMARY: Many syndromes of chronic dizziness can be diagnosed by recognition of key features, although many symptoms overlap between these groups. Symptoms may be manageable and improve with time, but they are often incompletely relieved.},

Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults. Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy. In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.},

Emphasis is placed on understanding the common underlying types of cerebrovascular disease (including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) and awareness of rare inherited cerebrovascular disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The pathophysiology of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia is heterogeneous, and the most recent diagnostic criteria for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia break down the diagnosis of major vascular dementia into four phenotypic categories, including subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, poststroke dementia, multi-infarct dementia, and mixed dementia. Control of cardiovascular risk factors, including management of midlife blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugars, remains the mainstay of prevention for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy requires special consideration when it comes to risk factor management given the increased risk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent trials suggest some improvement in global cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment and dementia with targeted cognitive rehabilitation.                                         SUMMARY               Thorough clinical evaluation and neuroimaging form the basis for diagnosis. As vascular cognitive impairment and dementia is the leading nondegenerative cause of dementia, identifying risk factors and optimizing their management is paramount.

RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective clinical studies have reinforced the understanding that migraine aura is highly variable from one individual to the next as well as from attack to attack in an individual. While migraine with aura clearly has a higher heritability than migraine without aura, population studies have not identified specific genes that underlie this heritability for typical migraine with aura. Imaging studies reveal hypoperfusion associated with migraine aura, although the timing and distribution of this hypoperfusion is not strictly correlated with migraine symptoms. Mapping of migraine visual aura symptoms onto the visual cortex suggests that the mechanisms underlying the aura propagate in a linear fashion along gyri or sulci rather than as a concentric wave and also suggests that aura may propagate in the absence of clinical symptoms. Cortical spreading depression in animal models continues to be a translational model for migraine, and the study of spreading depolarizations in the injured human brain has provided new insight into potential mechanisms of cortical spreading depression in migraine. Migraine with aura has multiple comorbidities including patent foramen ovale, stroke, and psychiatric disorders; the shared mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remains a topic of active investigation.

With the aging population, the number of people with atherosclerotic stroke will increase in the coming decades. This article reviews the recent developments in the assessment and treatment of extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

Vertebral artery dissection without preceding trauma history is quite rare in young ischemic stroke patients. Postural headache is even more atypical presentation for vertebral artery dissection. It is often misdiagnosed as spontaneous intracranial hypotension. We described a 37-year-old male suffering from acute onset postural headache with stroke in evolution during hospitalization. The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mislead to diagnosis of ischemic lesion. Nevertheless, with the aid of single photon emission computed tomography, we are confident the patient was afflicted with ischemic/hemorrhagic lesion, instead of neoplasm or demyelinating diseases. Lateral medullary syndrome was confirmed on the repeated brain MRI. His general condition improved with steady gait and clear articulation without easychoking after adequate hydration and rehabilitation training with aspirin as secondary prevention. Cranial artery dissections is a crucial differential diagnosis while thunderclap headache happens even related to postural change without obvious neurological deficit in the beginning presentations.},

Their impact on human health ranges from benign to severe. Deciphering autonomic symptoms and signs draws on the cognitive skills and personal interest in the plight of patients that first attracted many physicians to the field of neurology. This article provides tools to sharpen those skills.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Autonomic neuroscience and accumulated clinical knowledge have led to the categorization of autonomic disorders into specific syndromes that can be identified on the basis of clinical phenotypes and physiologic responses to standardized stimuli in the autonomic laboratory. A key development has been the ability to distinguish neurogenic orthostatic hypotension from other causes of hypotension. Quantification of sudomotor responses has proven valuable in the diagnosis of thermoregulatory disorders and small fiber neuropathies such as those related to diabetes mellitus. Increasing attention has focused on autonomic failure as a defining feature of neurodegenerative {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies, especially multiple system atrophy. As awareness of autonomic disorders has increased, the once obscure term                 dysautonomia                 has entered into common parlance.

Neurally mediated syncope is an episodic phenomenon in which autonomic nervous system function is normal the rest of the time. Although relatively benign, syncope increases the risk for injury from falling and can substantially impair patients' quality of life. Recognition of its various clinical presentations and knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology are essential for accurate diagnosis and successful management.                                         Recent Findings:               The most effective forms of treatment remain education of patients, avoidance of triggers, physical counterpressure maneuvers, and hydration or intravascular volume expansion. Pharmacologic interventions may be appropriate for some patients but, in general, have limited evidence of efficacy in preventing syncope. Based on the findings of a recent study, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered in patients hospitalized for syncope, whether or not an alternative etiology for syncope is identified.

This article reviews the anatomy of the spinal cord and discusses how the clinical findings, time course, and radiographic patterns can help to identify the causes of myelopathy.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Imaging observations such as MRI ``pancake'' gadolinium enhancement pattern with spondylotic myelopathy and subpial enhancement with neurosarcoidosis have improved diagnostic specificity. On the other hand, common diseases such as degenerative spine disease are now recognized as presenting much more variably. Improved imaging and the identification of genetic markers enhance the specificity of diagnosis. The improved identification of biomarkers has shown that the same cause, such as compressive myelopathy, can present more variably than previously appreciated.                                         SUMMARY               Spinal cord dysfunction, or myelopathy, remains a clinical diagnosis, and determining the cause requires integration of clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters, none of which have great specificity individually. Most cases of myelopathy will require further neuroimaging, and some require CSF analysis for diagnosis. This article presents an approach to the diagnosis of myelopathy based on excluding compressive myelopathy initially and then differentiating between acute and subacute processes and chronic causes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dry sauna treatments improve the quality of life for chronic pain, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes patients. This study aimed to determine whether dry sauna therapy improved the quality of life of obese people. METHODS: A total of 38 consecutive participants aged over 20 years with a body mass index of {$\geq$}25 kg/m2 were recruited for the study. The participants were treated with a 90{\textdegree}C dry sauna for 15 minutes, twice daily for 4 consecutive days. To assess the quality of life, all participants completed the 5 level EQ-5D questionnaires and the EQ-Visual Analog Scale. Study parameters were measured on the same day prior to commencing the sauna sessions in a fasted state and 2 days after the last sauna session. RESULTS: The average age was 62.3{$\pm$}9.5 years; 84.2\% of the participants were female. The mean body mass index was 28.5{$\pm$}2.4 kg/m2. Dry sauna significantly improved the mean 5 level EQ-5D index scores from 0.83{$\pm$}0.12 to 0.89{$\pm$}0.11 and increased the mean EQ-Visual Analog Scale from 79.0{$\pm$}15.2 to 91.1{$\pm$}9.7. However, there were no significant changes in body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate, or body composition before and after the 8-session sauna therapy. CONCLUSION: Dry sauna improved the health-related quality of life of obese patients without adverse events. Further clinical studies in larger study populations are needed to verify these findings and provide concrete evidence for obesity treatment.},

This article uses a case-based approach to guide readers through the fundamental epidemiology and pathogenesis of SAH, the approach to diagnosis and management, the results of clinical trials and evidence to date, prognostic considerations, controversies, recent developments, and future directions in SAH.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, management of SAH focused on prevention and treatment of subsequent cerebral vasospasm, which was thought to be the primary cause of delayed cerebral ischemia. Clinical and translational studies over the past decade, including several therapeutic phase 3 randomized clinical trials, suggest that the pathophysiology of SAH-associated brain injury is multiphasic and multifactorial beyond large vessel cerebral vasospasm. The quest to reduce SAH-associated brain injury and improve outcomes is shifting away from large vessel cerebral vasospasm to a new paradigm targeting multiple brain injury mechanisms, including early brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, spreading cortical depolarization, inflammation, and the brain-body interaction in vascular brain injury with critical illness.               Despite multiple negative randomized clinical trials in search of potential therapeutic agents ameliorating the downstream effects after SAH, the overall outcome of SAH has improved over recent decades, likely related to improvements in interventional options for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in critical care management. Emerging clinical evidence also suggests potential harmful impact of historic empiric treatments for SAH-associated vasospasm, such as prophylactic induction of hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (triple H therapy).               With decreasing mortality, long-term SAH survivorship and efforts to reduce chronic morbidity and to improve quality of life and patient-centered outcome are growing areas of unmet need. Despite existing guidelines, significant variabilities in local and regional practices and in scientific terminologies have historically limited advancement in SAH care and therapeutic development. Large global collaborative efforts developed harmonized SAH common data elements in 2019, and studies are under way to examine how existing variabilities in SAH care impact long-term SAH outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Although the overall incidence and mortality of SAH is decreasing with advances in preventive and acute care, SAH remains a major cause of long-term morbidity in survivors. Significant variabilities in care settings and empiric treatment protocols and inconsistent scientific terminologies have limited advancement in patient care and therapeutic clinical studies. Large consensus efforts are under way to introduce clinical guidelines and common data elements to advance therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcome.},

This article outlines the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of brain abscesses and spinal epidural abscesses, with a specific focus on bacterial infections.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The overall incidence of brain abscesses has declined, in part because of fewer brain abscesses associated with otogenic infections. However, emerging patient populations at high risk for brain abscess include those with a history of penetrating head trauma, neurosurgery, or immunodeficiency. Improved mortality rates for brain abscess are attributable to modern diagnostic imaging, stereotactic-guided aspiration, and newer antimicrobials that readily penetrate into the central nervous system and abscesses. Brain MRI is more sensitive than CT for brain abscess, particularly in the early stages, but CT remains more widely available and can adequately identify potential abscesses and confirm response to treatment. With the advent of minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques, surgical excision is often employed only for posterior fossa, multiloculated, or superficial well-circumscribed abscesses. In select clinical scenarios, conservative medical management may be a safe alternative to a combined surgical and medical approach. Unlike brain abscess, the incidence of spinal epidural abscess is on the rise and has been attributed to higher prevalence of predisposing factors, including spinal procedures and instrumentation.                                         SUMMARY               Successful diagnosis and management of brain abscess and spinal epidural abscess requires a collaborative approach among neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. The foundation of management of brain abscess includes surgical intervention for diagnostic purposes if a pathogen has not been identified or for decompression of larger abscesses or those with mass effect and significant surrounding edema; appropriate dosing and adequate duration of an antimicrobial regimen tailored to the presumptive source of infection and available culture data, and eradication of the primary source of infection. For spinal epidural abscesses, neurologic status at the time of presentation is directly related to outcomes, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and intervention.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis, the sexually transmissible stages of infection, has been on the rise for the past 2 decades. A concerning recent trend is the surge in cases of syphilis in women and of congenital syphilis. Neurosyphilis remains a relatively common complication that can occur at any stage of syphilis. Along with meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, which has been historically described as a late presentation of neurosyphilis, now frequently occurs as a manifestation of early infection. Late forms of neurosyphilis, including tabes dorsalis and general paresis, are less prevalent in the era of widespread penicillin use. As more laboratories adopt the reverse-sequence algorithm for syphilis testing, patients with serodiscordant results (ie, a reactive serum treponemal test with a nonreactive nontreponemal test) may present an increasingly encountered diagnostic challenge for neurologists. Although the CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) remains a mainstay of diagnostic testing for neurosyphilis, using a higher titer cutoff (greater than 1:320) for the                 Treponema pallidum                 particle agglutination assay (TPPA) from the CSF may improve the utility of the TPPA as a supporting criterion for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Penicillin G is the treatment of choice for neurosyphilis, although ceftriaxone may be a reasonable alternative therapy.                                                        SUMMARY               A high index of suspicion and awareness of the variable clinical presentations of neurosyphilis are essential to the approach to this treatable infection. Neurologists should be mindful of the limitations of serologic testing in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis and exercise clinical judgment to determine the likelihood of the diagnosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although prior studies suggested women have worse outcomes after stroke, it is now clear that age, prestroke functional status, and comorbidities explain many of the differences between men and women in stroke severity, functional outcomes, and mortality. Several meta-analyses and large cohort studies have evaluated the risk factors for women related to reproductive factors and found that fewer years between menarche and menopause, pregnancy complications (preeclampsia/eclampsia, preterm delivery, and stillbirth), oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy use, and younger age at menopause all increase the risk of stroke. Although the nonreproductive risks of stroke overlap between men and women, those with greater impact on women include age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, socioeconomic status, and depression.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed disc protrusion at L3/L4 and L4/L5 levels. Positive outcomes in relieving back and testicular pain were obtained after a total of 30 chiropractic sessions over a 9-week period. The evidence of the subjective improvement was corroborated by regression of the herniated discs documented on the repeat MR imaging. While chronic orchialgia is not an uncommon problem for men of all ages, it has seldom been described in association with lumbar discogenic disease. The current study provided preliminary support for a link between orchialgia and lumbar disc herniation.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes fluctuating weakness in ocular, bulbar, and limb muscles and can, in 15\% of cases, cause myasthenic crisis, a neurologic emergency characterized by respiratory failure. Although infrequent, MG needs to be promptly recognized and treated because the potential for improvement and remission is very high. The diagnosis of MG can be challenging and delayed because of the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness and the overlap of signs and symptoms with other neuromuscular diseases.               This article reviews the importance of prompt recognition of the typical signs and symptoms, best tests to confirm the diagnosis, currently available acute and chronic treatment modalities, the role of thymectomy, and the natural history of the disease. Special consideration related to the diagnosis and management in women during pregnancy and in children will also be reviewed. This article also includes an overview of congenital myasthenic syndromes.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent significant efforts in standardizing and improving the care of patients with MG have occurred, as well as new momentum in developing new drugs for patients with MG who do not adequately respond to currently available treatments. The number of clinical trials and drugs in development for MG is steadily increasing. Eculizumab has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor{\textendash}antibody positive, based on the REGAIN (Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis) study, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. An international, multicenter, randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone has demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcome in patients with nonthymomatous MG. Clinical care guidelines have been published, and the recommendations for clinical research standards and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America MGFA clinical classification published in 2000 have become widely accepted by the clinical and research community of MG experts.                                         SUMMARY               MG is a highly treatable disease with many effective treatment modalities available and with a natural history that continues to improve thanks to better diagnostic tests and effective drugs. The diagnosis and management of patients affected by MG can be highly rewarding for any neurologist as most patients are able to live normal lives if treated appropriately. Nevertheless, future research is needed to address unresolved clinical issues, such as when and how to discontinue immunosuppressive medications in patients in remission, the role and timing of thymectomy in children, and better treatment options for refractory patients.},

  abstract = {Circulating blood CD34(+) cells consist of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, angiogenic cells, and endothelial cells. In addition to their clinical use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CD34(+) cells may also promote therapeutic neovascularization. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence circulating CD34(+) cell frequency has wide implications for vascular biology in addition to stem cell transplantation. In the present study, we examined the clinical and genetic characteristics associated with circulating CD34(+) cell frequency in a large, community-based sample of 1786 Framingham Heart Study participants.Among subjects without cardiovascular disease (n = 1595), CD34(+) frequency was inversely related to older age, female sex, and smoking. CD34(+) frequency was positively related to weight, serum total cholesterol, and statin therapy. Clinical covariates accounted for 6.3\% of CD34(+) variability. CD34(+) frequency was highly heritable (h(2) = 54\%; P {$<$} .0001). Genome-wide association analysis of CD34(+) frequency identified suggestive associations at several loci, including OR4C12 (chromosome 11; P = 6.7 {\texttimes} 10(-7)) and ENO1 and RERE (chromosome 1; P = 8.8 {\texttimes} 10(-7)). CD34(+) cell frequency is reduced in older subjects and is influenced by environmental factors including smoking and statin use. CD34(+) frequency is highly heritable. The results of the present study have implications for therapies that use CD34(+) cell populations and support efforts to better understand the genetic mechanisms that underlie CD34(+) frequency.},

Over the past decade, advances in genetic testing have revolutionized patient evaluation. The main goal of this review is to give the clinician the basic understanding to recognize patients at risk of these diseases using the standard history and physical examination.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Primary mitochondrial disease                 is the current designation for the illnesses resulting from genetic mutations in genes whose protein products are necessary for mitochondrial structure or function. In most circumstances, more than one organ system is involved in mitochondrial disease, and the value of the classic clinical features as originally described early in the history of mitochondrial diseases has reemerged as being important to identifying patients who may have a primary mitochondrial disease. The use of the genetic laboratory has become the most powerful tool for confirming a diagnosis, and nuances of using genetic results will be discussed in this article. Treatment for mitochondrial disease is symptomatic, with less emphasis on vitamin and supplement therapy than in the past. Clinical trials using pharmacologic agents are in progress, with the field attempting to define proper goals of treatment. Several standard accepted therapies exist for many of the metabolic myopathies.                                                        SUMMARY               Mitochondrial, lipid, and glycogen diseases are not uncommon causes of multisystem organ dysfunction, with the neurologic features, especially myopathy, occurring as a predominant feature. Early recognition requires basic knowledge of the varied clinical phenotypes before moving forward with a screening evaluation and possibly a genetic evaluation. Aside from a few specific diseases for which there are recommended interventions, treatment for the majority of  these disorders remains symptomatic, with clinical trials currently in progress that will hopefully result in standard treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis is often identified as a potential etiologic cause for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Given the high prevalence of large artery atherosclerosis in the general population, determining whether an identified atherosclerotic lesion is truly the cause of a patient's symptomatology can be difficult. In all cases, optimally treating each patient to minimize future stroke risk is paramount. Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis can be broadly compartmentalized into four distinct clinical scenarios based upon the individual patient's history, examination, and anatomic imaging findings: asymptomatic and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis, and extracranial vertebral artery atherosclerotic disease. This review provides a framework for clinicians evaluating and treating such patients.                                         Recent Findings:               Intensive medical therapy achieves low rates of stroke and death in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Evidence indicates that patients with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis should undergo carotid revascularization sooner rather than later and that the risk of stroke or death is lower using carotid endarterectomy than with carotid stenting. Specific to stenting, the risk of stroke or death is greatest among older patients and women. Continuous vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy is the mainstay for stroke prevention in the setting of intracranial and vertebral artery origin atherosclerosis.                                         Summary:               Lifelong vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy are the key elements to reduce future stroke risk in the setting of large artery atherosclerosis. When considering a revascularization procedure for carotid stenosis, patient demographics, comorbidities, and the periprocedural risks of stroke and death should be carefully considered.},

Patients with striatal, but not frontal lobe lesions, were impaired in switching between concrete sensory stimuli. By contrast, both patient groups were unimpaired when switching between abstract task rules relative to baseline nonswitch trials. These results reveal a dissociation between two distinct forms of cognitive flexibility, providing converging evidence for a role of the striatum in flexible control functions associated with the selection of behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Disorders of thermoregulation and sweating may manifest with hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis/anhidrosis. Primary disorders of hyperhidrosis may significantly impact quality of life yet tend to be benign. Many sweating disorders present with compensatory hyperhidrosis due to areas of anhidrosis. Anhidrosis may occur due to either central or peripheral damage to the autonomic nervous system. The thermoregulatory control of sweating involves central pathways from the hypothalamus to the brainstem and then spinal cord as well as projections to peripheral structures, including the sympathetic chain ganglia, peripheral nerves, and eccrine sweat glands. Disruption at any point of this pathway may lead to impaired sweating. Characterization of sweating dysfunction helps localize different autonomic disorders to guide diagnosis and may allow for evaluation of treatment effect.                                         SUMMARY               Sweating dysfunction manifests in myriad ways, including essential hyperhidrosis, complete anhidrosis with heat intolerance, and compensatory hyperhidrosis due to anhidrosis, and often indicates involvement of underlying central or peripheral autonomic dysfunction.},

The normalized surface electromyographic root-mean-square (sEMG RMS) amplitude of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, adductor longus, longissimus, and iliocostalis was recorded during both the ascending and descending phase of each exercise.

Moreover, rectus femoris activation was greater in FS compared to full-BS (p {$<$} 0.05). No between-exercise difference was found in vastus medialis and longissimus showed no between-exercise difference. FS needs more backward stabilization during the descending phase.

These disorders are not merely historical curiosities, however. As apraxia, neglect, and agnosia have important clinical implications, it is important to possess a working knowledge of the conditions and how to identify them.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Apraxia is a disorder of skilled action that is frequently observed in the setting of dominant hemisphere pathology, whether from stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast to some previous teaching, apraxia has clear clinical relevance as it is associated with poor recovery from stroke. Neglect is a complex disorder with many different manifestations that may have different underlying mechanisms. Neglect is, in the author's view, a multicomponent disorder in which impairment in attention and arousal is a major contributor. Finally, agnosias come in a wide variety of forms, reflecting impairments ranging from low-level sensory processing to access to stored knowledge of the world (semantics).                                         SUMMARY               The classic behavioral disorders reviewed here were of immense interest to early neurologists because of their arresting clinical phenomenology; more recent investigations have done much to advance the neuroscientific understanding of the disorders and to reveal their clinical relevance.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of the pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG autoantibody and characterization of NMOSD as an autoimmune astrocytopathy have spearheaded the identification of key immunologic therapeutic targets in this disease, including but not limited to the complement system, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, and B cells. Accordingly, four recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of three new NMOSD therapies, namely eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab.                                         SUMMARY               Currently, NMOSD poses both diagnostic and treatment challenges. It is debated whether individuals who are seropositive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG belong within the neuromyelitis optica spectrum. This discussion is fueled by disparities in treatment responses between patients who are AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative, suggesting different immunopathologic mechanisms may govern these conditions. As our understanding regarding the immune pathophysiology of NMOSD expands, emerging biomarkers, including serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), may facilitate earlier relapse detection and inform long-term treatment decisions. Future research focal points should include strategies to optimize relapse management, restorative treatments that augment neurologic recovery, and practical solutions that promote equitable access to approved therapies for all patients with NMOSD.},

Recent Findings:               Up to a 10\% risk of recurrent stroke exists after a TIA, and up to 80\% of this risk is preventable with urgent assessment and treatment. Imaging of the brain and intracranial and extracranial blood vessels using CT, CT angiography, carotid Doppler ultrasound, and MRI is an important part of the diagnostic assessment. Treatment options include anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, carotid revascularization for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, antiplatelet therapy, and vascular risk factor reduction strategies.

These therapies contrast with acute stroke treatments such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and thrombectomy that target clots, aim to salvage threatened brain tissue to limit injury, and have a time window measured in hours. Restorative therapies target the brain, aim to promote plasticity within surviving brain tissue, and have a time window measured in days to weeks or longer.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               A number of drugs are under study. Preclinical studies are providing attractive therapeutic candidates for translation, such as the C-C chemokine receptor 5 inhibitor maraviroc. Some drug studies have used a pragmatic approach, which is premature for the nascent field of neural repair. Substantial data support the utility of activity-dependent therapies, including constraint-induced movement therapy, with recent studies supporting the need for very high doses to generate the best functional gains. While stem cell therapies are at an early stage, mounting preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells; some initial human studies are supportive. Several types of brain stimulation have been examined, and in some cases initial studies are promising.

RECENT FINDINGS               The armamentarium of immunotherapies has grown rapidly, to encompass 19 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunotherapies available in 2021, which are addressed in the review. The coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 underscored existing concerns regarding vaccine efficacy in those treated with immune-suppressing immunotherapies, which are also addressed here.                                         SUMMARY               By choosing a treatment strategy before exploring the individual medications, patients and providers can focus their efforts on a subset of the therapeutic options. Although the mechanisms of action, routes of administration, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the described agents and classes differ, all are effective in reducing relapse frequency in multiple sclerosis (MS), with most also showing a reduction in the accumulation of neurologic disability. These powerful effects are improving the lives of people with MS. Pharmacovigilance is critical for the safe use of these immune-modulating and -suppressing agents, and vaccine efficacy may be reduced by those with immune-suppressing effects.},

Recent Findings:               Currently, a worldwide controversy exists regarding the classification, diagnostic process, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. This controversy has been caused on one side by the recognition that some 50\% of patients with trigeminal neuralgia, apart from characteristic paroxysmal attacks, also have continuous pain in the same territory, which results in greater diagnostic difficulties and is associated with a lower response to medical and surgical treatments. In contrast, recent developments in MRI methods allow differentiation between a mere neurovascular contact and an effective compression of the trigeminal root by an anomalous vessel, which implies more difficulties in the choice of surgical treatment, with the indication for microvascular decompression becoming more restricted.                                         Summary:               This article proposes that the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, with or without concomitant continuous pain, must rely on clinical grounds only. Diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish three etiologic categories: idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (nothing is found), classic trigeminal neuralgia (an anomalous vessel produces morphologic changes of the trigeminal root near its entry into the pons), and secondary trigeminal neuralgia (due to major neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis or tumors at the cerebellopontine angle). Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine (ie, voltage-gated, frequency-dependent sodium channel blockers) are still the first-choice medical treatment, although many patients experience significant side effects, and those with concomitant continuous pain respond less well to treatment. The development of sodium channel blockers that are selective for the sodium channel 1.7 (Na               v               1.7) receptor will hopefully help. Although all the surgical interventions (percutaneous ganglion lesions, gamma knife radiosurgery, and microvascular decompression) are very efficacious, precise MRI criteria for differentiating a real neurovascular compression from an irrelevant contact will be of benefit in better selecting patients for microvascular decompression.},

  abstract = {Upper limb amputation can result in significant functional impairment necessitating a comprehensive rehabilitation approach throughout the continuum of care. In 2022, the Departments of Veteran Affairs and Defense completed an updated clinical practice guideline for the management of upper limb amputation rehabilitation. This practice guideline was developed by a workgroup of subject-matter experts from a variety of disciplines. Twelve key questions were developed by the workgroup using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing of outcomes measurement, and setting) format to establish the scope of the literature review. Eighteen recommendations were developed through extensive review of the available literature and use of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. The strength of each recommendation was determined based on the quality of the research evidence and the additional domains of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. Of the 18 recommendations, 4 were found to have sufficient evidence to suggest for use of a particular rehabilitation management strategy. Thus, the 2022 Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense clinical practice guideline provides updated, evidence-based information on the care and rehabilitation of persons with upper limb amputation. However, a significant lack of high-quality evidence in upper limb amputation rehabilitation limited evidence-based clinical guidance to assist healthcare providers in managing this population.},

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched until February 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised trials that included healthy adults, compared at least 2 predefined conditions (non-exercise control (CTRL) and 12 RTx, differentiated by load, sets and/or weekly frequency), and reported muscle strength and/or hypertrophy were included. ANALYSES: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis methodology was used to compare RTxs and CTRL. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve values were used to rank conditions. Confidence was assessed with threshold analysis. RESULTS: The strength network included 178 studies (n=5097; women=45\%). The hypertrophy network included 119 studies (n=3364; women=47\%). All RTxs were superior to CTRL for muscle strength and hypertrophy. Higher-load ({$>$}80\% of single repetition maximum) prescriptions maximised strength gains, and all prescriptions comparably promoted muscle hypertrophy. While the calculated effects of many prescriptions were similar, higher-load, multiset, thrice-weekly training (standardised mean difference (95\% credible interval); 1.60 (1.38 to 1.82) vs CTRL) was the highest-ranked RTx for strength, and higher-load, multiset, twice-weekly training (0.66 (0.47 to 0.85) vs CTRL) was the highest-ranked RTx for hypertrophy. Threshold analysis demonstrated these results were extremely robust. CONCLUSION: All RTx promoted strength and hypertrophy compared with no exercise. The highest-ranked prescriptions for strength involved higher loads, whereas the highest-ranked prescriptions for hypertrophy included multiple sets.

RECENT FINDINGS               POTS is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by several pathophysiologic mechanisms that may coexist (limited autonomic neuropathy, hyperadrenergic state, hypovolemia, venous pooling, joint hypermobility, deconditioning). Neurally mediated syncope occurs despite intact autonomic reflexes. Management of orthostatic intolerance aims to increase functional capacity, including standing time, performance of daily activities, and exercise tolerance. Nonpharmacologic strategies (fluid and salt loading, physical countermaneuvers, compression garments, exercise training) are fundamental for patients with POTS, occasionally complemented by medications to raise blood pressure or slow heart rate. Neurally mediated syncope is best managed by recognition and avoidance of triggers.                                         SUMMARY               Significant negative effects on quality of life occur in patients with POTS and in patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope, which can be mitigated through targeted evaluation and thoughtful management.},

  abstract = {Creatine is one of the most popular athletic supplements with sales surpassing 400 million dollars in 2004. Due to the popularity and efficacy of creatine supplementation over 200 studies have examined the effects of creatine on athletic performance. Despite the abundance of research suggesting the effectiveness and safety of creatine, a fallacy appears to exist among the general public, driven by media claims and anecdotal reports, that creatine supplementation can result in muscle cramps and dehydration. Although a number of published studies have refuted these claims, a recent position statement by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) in 2000 advised individuals who are managing their weight and exercising intensely or in hot environments to avoid creatine supplementation. Recent reports now suggest that creatine may enhance performance in hot and/or humid conditions by maintaining haematocrit, aiding thermoregulation and reducing exercising heart rate and sweat rate. Creatine may also positively influence plasma volume during the onset of dehydration. Considering these new published findings, little evidence exists that creatine supplementation in the heat presents additional risk, and this should be taken into consideration as position statements and other related documents are published.},

It highlights the primary mood disorders and secondary neurologic causes of mood disorders that are commonly encountered in a clinical setting. As the literature and our understanding evolve, recent additions to the current literature are important to bring forth to the readers.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advancements in clinical medicine have strengthened our understanding of the associations of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. This article highlights the medications frequently used with newly identified mood disorders and the common side effects of these medications. A paradigm shift has moved toward newer treatment modalities, such as the use of ketamine, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and complementary and alternative medicine. The risks and benefits of such therapies, along with medications, are reviewed in this article.                                         SUMMARY               Mood disorders are extraordinarily complex disorders with significant association with many neurologic disorders. Early identification of these mood disorders can prevent significant morbidity and mortality associated with them. With further expansion of pharmacologic options, more targeted therapy is possible in improving quality of life for patients.},

Bacterial meningitis is usually lethal unless appropriate antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier are given. Clinical suspicion of bacterial meningitis begins when patients present with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, and meningismus.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               New technologies are being developed for more rapid identification of the bacterial species causing meningitis. When appropriate, administration of adjunctive dexamethasone with the antibiotics often lessens neurologic sequelae in survivors, which may include aphasia, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment.                                         SUMMARY               Confirmation of the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis comes mainly from examination and culture of CSF obtained from a lumbar puncture. Typically, the CSF shows an elevated neutrophil count, elevated protein, depressed glucose, positive Gram stain, and growth of the bacteria on appropriate culture media. Antibiotic sensitivities of the bacteria determine the appropriate antibiotics, although an educated guess of the best antibiotics to be given promptly must be made until the antibiotic sensitivities return, usually in a few days.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Substantial variability exists in the presenting features and clinical course of patients with common neurodegenerative causes of dementia, but the response to available therapies and eventual outcomes are often poor. This realization has influenced the evaluation of patients with dementia, with diagnostic approaches emphasizing routine screening for a short list of potentially modifiable disorders that may exacerbate dementia symptoms or severity but rarely influence long-term outcomes. Although a standard approach to the assessment of dementia is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, neurologists involved in the assessment of patients with dementia must recognize those rare patients with reversible causes of dementia, coordinate additional investigations when required, and ensure expedited access to treatments that may reverse decline and optimize long-term outcomes.

  abstract = {Skin aging has become a recurring concern even for younger people, mainly owing to increased life expectancy. In this context, the use of nutricosmetics as supplements has increased in recent years. Moreover, numerous scientific studies have shown the benefits of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation in improving the signs of skin aging. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence on the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on human skin through a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of clinical trials focusing on the process of skin aging. A literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), and Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine databases. Eligible studies were randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials that evaluated oral supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen as an intervention and reported at least one of the following outcomes: skin wrinkles, hydration, elasticity, and firmness. After retrieving articles from the databases, 19 studies were selected, with a total of 1,125 participants aged between 20 and 70\,years (95\% women). In the meta-analysis, a grouped analysis of studies showed favorable results of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation compared with placebo in terms of skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles. The findings of improved hydration and elasticity were also confirmed in the subgroup meta-analysis. Based on results, ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen for 90\,days is effective in reducing skin aging, as it reduces wrinkles and improves skin elasticity and hydration.},

This is a purely motor nerve, responsible for the innervation of all the intrinsic tongue muscles (superior longitudinal muscle, inferior longitudinal muscle, transverse muscle, and vertical muscle), 3 extrinsic tongue muscles (styloglossus, hyoglossus, and genioglossus), and the geniohyoid muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging exam to evaluate patients with clinical signs of hypoglossal nerve palsy, and computed tomography may have a complementary role in the evaluation of bone lesions affecting the hypoglossal canal. A heavily T2-weighted sequence, such as fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) or constructive interference steady state (CISS) is important to evaluate this nerve on MRI. There are multiple causes of hypoglossal nerve palsy, being neoplasia the most common cause, but vascular lesions, inflammatory diseases, infections, and trauma can also affect this nerve. The purpose of this article is to review the hypoglossal nerve anatomy, discuss the best imaging techniques to evaluate this nerve and demonstrate the imaging aspect of the main diseases that affect it.},

These disorders commonly occur in head trauma, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson disease and dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer disease, just to name a few. This article covers the basic anatomy of smell and taste, notes the important points of taking a proper history, and discusses smell and taste testing, which are inexpensive, minimally time-consuming procedures. Recurrent bad smells and tastes are not uncommon in these disorders, which cause major impairment in quality of life, including loss of appetite, decreased eating, and weight loss. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders will also be discussed.                                         Recent Findings:               Despite past widespread negative prognoses of taste and smell disorders, more recent work in the last 10 years has shown an improved prognosis for smell and taste recovery in most disorders, and recommendations for changes in food preparation have helped many patients enjoy their food and increase their appetite. Recent experimental evidence has shown that smell loss and testing can assist in separating idiopathic Parkinson disease from other parkinsonian syndromes, can suggest which patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder will more likely develop Parkinson disease, and can be predictive of the progression of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia.                                         Summary:               This article discusses the common smell and taste disorders that a clinical neurologist will encounter in practice.

An anatomic approach is used; diseases of the extradural, intradural-extramedullary, and intramedullary (parenchymal) compartments are considered, and both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions are covered. Differentiating imaging features are highlighted.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although T2-hyperintense signal abnormality of the spinal cord can have myriad etiologies, neuroimaging can provide specific diagnoses or considerably narrow the differential diagnosis in many cases. Intradural-extramedullary lesions compressing the spinal cord have a limited differential diagnosis and are usually benign; meningiomas and schwannomas are most common. Extradural lesions can often be specifically diagnosed. Disk herniations are the most commonly encountered mass of the epidural space. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy can cause a characteristic pattern of enhancement, which may be mistaken for an intrinsic myelopathy. A do-not-miss diagnosis of the extradural compartment is idiopathic spinal cord herniation, the appearance of which can overlap with arachnoid cysts and webs. Regarding intrinsic causes of myelopathy, the lesions of multiple sclerosis are characteristically short segment but can be confluent when multiple. Postcontrast MRI can be particularly helpful, including when attempting to differentiate the long-segment myelopathy of neurosarcoidosis and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG{\textendash}seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and when characterizing spinal cord tumors such as primary neoplasms and metastases. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula is another do-not-miss diagnosis, with characteristic MRI features both precontrast and postcontrast. Tract-specific white matter involvement can be a clue for diseases such as subacute combined degeneration, paraneoplastic myelopathy, and radiation myelitis, whereas gray matter{\textendash}specific involvement can suggest conditions such as cord infarct, viral myelitis, or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG associated disorder.                                         SUMMARY               Knowledge of the neuroimaging findings of the many causes of spinal cord and cauda equina dysfunction is critical for both neurologists and neuroradiologists. A structured approach to lesion compartmental location and imaging feature characterization is recommended.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               A tie between nutritional or gastrointestinal and neurologic disease has been recognized for centuries. Many gastrointestinal disorders are associated with neurologic disease through nutritional, immune-mediated, or degenerative pathophysiologies. This article reviews neurologic disorders in patients with gastrointestinal disease and gastrointestinal manifestations in their own neurologic patients.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                Development of new gastric and bariatric surgical procedures and the widespread use of over-the-counter gastric acid{\textendash}reducing medications continue to create vitamin and nutritional deficiencies despite modern diet and supplementation. Some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin B                 6                 , and selenium, themselves are now found to cause disease. Recent work has shown extraintestinal and neurologic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic brain damage in liver disease has been recognized, and the opportunity to intervene may exist in the covert beginning stages. The characterization of gluten-related neurologic symptoms and differentiation from those of celiac disease is an evolving body of work.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               Gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases related to common immune-mediated, degenerative, or infectious mechanisms are common and can coexist in the same patient. Furthermore, gastrointestinal disease may cause neurologic complications because of nutritional inadequacies, malabsorption, and hepatic dysfunction. In many cases, the complications are treatable but have subtle or protean presentations. Therefore, the consulting neurologist must be current in knowledge of the growing ties between gastrointestinal and neurologic disease.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cancer therapies can cause a wide range of neurologic adverse effects and may result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Although some treatment-associated neurologic complications manifest acutely and are often reversible and transient, others occur with delayed onset, can be progressive, and are uniquely challenging to patient management. With an increase in multimodality and combination therapies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, and prolonged patient survival, novel and unique patterns of neurologic complications have emerged.                                         SUMMARY               Both conventional and novel cancer therapies can adversely affect the nervous system, thereby producing a wide range of neurologic complications. Increased awareness among neurologists and early recognition of cancer therapy{\textendash}induced neurotoxic syndromes is critically important to minimize patient morbidity, prevent permanent injury, and improve patient outcomes.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The vast majority of patients presenting with headache in clinical practice have a primary headache disorder. The most common primary headache disorder in clinical practice is overwhelmingly migraine. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients with migraine do not receive an accurate diagnosis. In addition, the clinical features of migraine overlap with secondary causes of headache, making a careful history and deliberative evaluation for warning symptoms or signs of a secondary headache disorder of paramount importance.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to the patient with headache requires knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for primary headache disorders, recognition of the importance of a systematic evaluation for red flags associated with secondary headache disorders, and awareness of the pearls and pitfalls encountered in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with headache.},

  abstract = {Iron and copper have similar physiochemical properties; thus, physiologically relevant interactions seem likely. Indeed, points of intersection between these two essential trace minerals have been recognized for many decades, but mechanistic details have been lacking. Investigations in recent years have revealed that copper may positively influence iron homeostasis, and also that iron may antagonize copper metabolism. For example, when body iron stores are low, copper is apparently redistributed to tissues important for regulating iron balance, including enterocytes of upper small bowel, the liver, and blood. Copper in enterocytes may positively influence iron transport, and hepatic copper may enhance biosynthesis of a circulating ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin, which potentiates iron release from stores. Moreover, many intestinal genes related to iron absorption are transactivated by a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-2{$\alpha$} (HIF2{$\alpha$}), during iron deficiency. Interestingly, copper influences the DNA-binding activity of the HIF factors, thus further exemplifying how copper may modulate intestinal iron homeostasis. Copper may also alter the activity of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Furthermore, copper depletion has been noted in iron-loading disorders, such as hereditary hemochromatosis. Copper depletion may also be caused by high-dose iron supplementation, raising concerns particularly in pregnancy when iron supplementation is widely recommended. This review will cover the basic physiology of intestinal iron and copper absorption as well as the metabolism of these minerals in the liver. Also considered in detail will be current experimental work in this field, with a focus on molecular aspects of intestinal and hepatic iron-copper interplay and how this relates to various disease states. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Physiological Society.

RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the short- and mid-term effects of proprioceptive and balance training for patients undergoing total knee and hip replacement. METHODS: This is a systematic review of literature. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PEDro, and Scopus were the databases searched. The review included randomized clinical trials in which the experimental groups underwent a training aimed at improving balance and proprioception, in addition to conventional care. The studies had to assess at least one of the following outcomes: self-reported functionality or balance (primary outcomes), knee function, pain, falls, or quality of life. RESULTS: Eight trials were included, involving 567 participants. The quantitative synthesis found a moderate to high significant effect of balance and proprioceptive trainings on self-reported functionality and balance after total knee replacement. The effects were maintained at mid-term in terms of balance alone. Conversely, preoperative training did not enhance outcomes after total hip arthroplasty. SIGNIFICANCE: The synthesis showed that, in clinical terms, balance trainings are a convenient complement to conventional physiotherapy care to produce an impact on balance and functionality after knee replacement. If outcomes such as improvement in pain, knee range of movement, or patient quality of life are to be promoted, it would be advisable to explore alternative proposals specifically targeting these goals. Further research is needed to confirm or discard the current evidence ultimately, predominantly in terms of the effects on the hips and those yielded by preoperative interventions.},

Recent Findings:               GBS is an acute/subacute-onset polyradiculoneuropathy typically presenting with sensory symptoms and weakness over several days, often leading to quadriparesis. Approximately 70\% of patients report a recent preceding upper or lower respiratory tract infection or gastrointestinal illness. Approximately 30\% of patients require intubation and ventilation because of respiratory failure. Nerve conduction studies in the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) form of GBS typically show evidence for a multifocal demyelinating process, including conduction block or temporal dispersion in motor nerves. Sural sparing is a common phenomenon when testing sensory nerves. CSF analysis commonly shows an elevated protein, but this elevation may not be present until the third week of the illness. Patients with AIDP are treated with best medical management and either IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange.                                         Summary:               GBS is a common form of acute quadriparesis; a high level of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis. With appropriate therapy, most patients make a very good to complete recovery.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Muscle symptoms are common among statin users and are usually reversible after discontinuation of the statin; rarely, however, statins trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy that persists and requires immunomodulatory therapy. Autoantibodies targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase can distinguish the toxic and immune-mediated forms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, increasingly used in the treatment of advanced cancer, have recently been associated with the development of inflammatory myositis. A reversible mitochondrial myopathy has long been associated with zidovudine, but recent reports elucidate the risk of myopathy with newer antivirals, such as telbivudine and raltegravir.                                         SUMMARY               The medications most commonly associated with myopathy include statins, amiodarone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, certain antivirals, and corticosteroids, and myopathy can occur with chronic alcoholism. Certain clinical, electrodiagnostic, and histologic features can aid in early recognition. Stopping the use of the offending agent reverses symptoms in most cases, but specific and timely treatment may be required in cases related to agents that trigger immune-mediated muscle injury.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience deficits in motor and cognitive domains, resulting in impairment in dual-task walking ability. The goal of this study was to compare performance of forward walking and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions in persons with MS to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We also examined relationships between forward and backward walking to cognitive function, balance, and retrospective fall reports. METHODS: All measures were collected in a single session. A 2 {\texttimes} 2 {\texttimes} 2 mixed model ANOVA was used to compare differences in forward and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions between MS and healthy controls. Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between gait and cognitive function, falls, and balance. RESULTS: Eighteen individuals with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated. Backward walking velocity revealed significant differences between groups for both single-task (p = 0.015) and dual-task (p = 0.014) conditions. Persons with MS demonstrated significant differences between single- and dual-task forward and backward walking velocities (p = 0.023; p = 0.004), whereas this difference was only apparent in the backward walking condition for healthy controls (p = 0.004). In persons with MS, there were significant differences in double support time between single- and dual-task conditions in both backward (p {$<$} 0.001) and forward (p = 0.001) directions. More falls at six months were significantly associated with shorter backward dual-task stride length (r = -0.490; p = 0.046) and slower velocity (r = -0.483; p = 0.050). CONCLUSION: Differences in MS and age- and sex-matched healthy controls are more pronounced during backward compared to forward walking under single- and dual-task conditions. Future work with a larger sample size is needed to validate the clinical utility of backward walking and dual-task assessments and mitigate the limited sensitivity of the current dual-task assessments that primarily rely upon forward walking.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with multiple sclerosis experience deficits in mobility resulting in injurious falls. Fall detection has proved challenging; the majority of clinical measures rely on forward walking and balance measures, yet these measures have poor sensitivity and predictive value for differentiating between fallers and non-fallers. Backward walking better differentiates fallers from non-fallers in the elderly and other neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, the objective of this study was to examine both forward and backward walking to determine the strongest, unique contributor that differentiates fallers from non-fallers in persons with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In a single session, spatiotemporal measures of forward and backward walking and fall history were collected. For the subsequent six months, individuals recorded falls in a fall diary. Discriminant function analysis was used to determine what variables most strongly and uniquely differentiate multiple sclerosis fallers from non-fallers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis participated. Forward and backward velocity, stride length, and double support time as well as age, disease severity, and symptom duration were included in the models. Together, the variables differentiated between fallers and non-fallers (Wilk's lambda {$\chi$}2 (8, N~=~36)~=~0.497, p{$<$}0.001) and in rank order, backward walking velocity was the strongest unique predictor. Repeating the analysis with a stepwise approach yielded that backward walking velocity in the first step ({$\chi$}2 (1, 34)~=~0.68, F~=~15.96, p{$<$}0.001) and symptom duration in the second step ({$\chi$}2~=~0.59, F (2, 33)~=~11.46; p{$<$}0.001) most strongly differentiated retrospective fallers and non-fallers. This stepwise model with backward walking velocity and symptom duration accurately classified 76.3\% of cases. Addition of forward walking measures did not significantly improve the models, and indeed the accuracy of classification was reduced to 71.1\%. Exploratory analysis showed that backward walking velocity was the best predictor of prospectively reported fallers and non-fallers ({$\chi$}2 (1, 7)~=~0.43, F~=~9.20, p~=~0.02). CONCLUSION: Backward walking velocity exhibits the highest effect magnitude and specificity in differentiating fallers from non-fallers in individuals with MS and demonstrates potential as clinically feasible and efficient fall detection tool.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Conditions causing recurrent spontaneous episodes of dizziness or vertigo span several medical specialties, making it challenging for clinicians to gain confidence in evaluating and managing the spectrum of episodic vestibular disorders. Patients are often asymptomatic and have normal examinations at the time of evaluation. Thus, diagnosis depends heavily on eliciting key features from the history. Overreliance on symptom quality descriptions commonly leads to misdiagnosis. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to the diagnosis and management of conditions that cause episodic spontaneous dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Consensus diagnostic criteria have been established for vestibular migraine, M{\'e}ni{\`e}re disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo. Vertigo has been recognized as a common symptom in vertebrobasilar ischemia, cardiogenic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Treatment recommendations for vestibular migraine still lack high-quality evidence, but controlled trials are occurring. SUMMARY: The evaluation should start with a detailed description of the episodes from the patient and any observers. Rather than focusing first on whether the symptom quality is most consistent with vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness, the clinician should clarify the timing (episode frequency and duration), possible triggers or circumstances (eg, position changes, upright posture), and accompanying symptoms. History should identify any auditory symptoms, migraine features, posterior circulation ischemic symptoms, vascular risk factors, clues for anxiety, and potentially relevant medications. Carefully selected testing can help secure the diagnosis, but excessive and indiscriminate testing can lead to more confusion. Treatments for these conditions are vastly different, so an accurate diagnosis is critical.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between infection and stroke has taken on new urgency in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This association is not a new concept, as several infections have long been recognized to contribute to stroke risk. The association of infection and stroke is also bidirectional. Although infection can lead to stroke, stroke also induces immune suppression which increases risk of infection. Apart from their short-term effects, emerging evidence suggests that poststroke immune changes may also adversely affect long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with stroke, increasing the risk of poststroke neurodegeneration and dementia. Infections at the time of stroke may also increase immune dysregulation after the stroke, further exacerbating the risk of cognitive decline. This review will cover the role of acute infections, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, as a trigger for stroke; the role of infectious burden, or the cumulative number of infections throughout life, as a contributor to long-term risk of atherosclerotic disease and stroke; immune dysregulation after stroke and its effect on the risk of stroke-associated infection; and the impact of infection at the time of a stroke on the immune reaction to brain injury and subsequent long-term cognitive and functional outcomes. Finally, we will present a model to conceptualize the many relationships among chronic and acute infections and their short- and long-term neurological consequences. This model will suggest several directions for future research.},

The importance and sequelae of lifetime trauma burden are discussed, with reference to trends in prevention, early intervention, and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD has different clinical phenotypes, which are reflected in the changes in                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) criteria. PTSD is almost always complicated by comorbidity. Treatment requires a multimodal approach, usually including medication, different therapeutic techniques, and management of comorbidity. Interest is growing in the neurobiology of childhood survivors of trauma, intergenerational transmission of trauma, and long-term impact of trauma on physical health. Mitigation of the risk of PTSD pretrauma in the military and first responders is gaining momentum, given concerns about the cost and disability associated with PTSD. Interest is also growing in screening for PTSD in medical populations, with evidence of improved clinical outcomes. Preliminary research supports the treatment of PTSD with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.                                                        SUMMARY               PTSD is a trauma-related disorder with features of fear and negative thinking about the trauma and the future. Untreated, it leads to ongoing disruption of life due to avoidance, impaired vocational and social functioning, and other symptoms, depending on the phenotype. Despite a theoretical understanding of underlying mechanisms, PTSD remains challenging to treat, although evidence exists for benefit of pharmacologic agents and trauma-focused therapies. A need still remains for treatments that are more effective and efficient, with faster onset.},

Strict evaluation is needed whenever we aim at validating any potential diagnostic tool, and the first requirement a new testing procedure must fulfill is diagnostic accuracy. SUMMARY: Diagnostic accuracy measures tell us about the ability of a test to discriminate between and/or predict disease and health. This discriminative and predictive potential can be quantified by measures of diagnostic accuracy such as sensitivity and specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, overall accuracy and diagnostic odds ratio. Some measures are useful for discriminative purposes, while others serve as a predictive tool. Measures of diagnostic accuracy vary in the way they depend on the prevalence, spectrum and definition of the disease. In general, measures of diagnostic accuracy are extremely sensitive to the design of the study. Studies not meeting strict methodological standards usually over- or underestimate the indicators of test performance and limit the applicability of the results of the study. KEY MESSAGES: The testing procedure should be verified on a reasonable population, including people with mild and severe disease, thus providing a comparable spectrum. Sensitivities and specificities are not predictive measures. Predictive values depend on disease prevalence, and their conclusions can be transposed to other settings only for studies which are based on a suitable population (e.g. screening studies). Likelihood ratios should be an optimal choice for reporting diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic accuracy measures must be reported with their confidence intervals. We always have to report paired measures (sensitivity and specificity, predictive values or likelihood ratios) for clinically meaningful thresholds. How much discriminative or predictive power we need depends on the clinical diagnostic pathway and on misclassification (false positives/negatives) costs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The contribution of rib fractures to prolonged pain and disability may be underappreciated and undertreated. Clinicians are traditionally taught that the pain and disability of rib fractures resolves in 6 to 8 weeks. METHODS: This study was a prospective observation of 203 patients with rib fractures at a level 1 trauma center. Chest wall pain was evaluated by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI). Prolonged pain was defined as a PRI of 8 or more at 2 months after injury. Prolonged disability was defined as a decrease in 1 or more levels of work or functional status at 2 months after injury. Predictors of prolonged pain and disability were determined by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five male patients and 58 female patients with a mean injury severity score (ISS) of 20 (range, 1 to 59) had a mean of 5.4 rib fractures (range, 1 to 29). Forty-four (22\%) patients had bilateral fractures, 15 (7\%) had flail chest, and 92 (45\%) had associated injury. One hundred eighty-seven patients were followed 2 months or more. One hundred ten (59\%) patients had prolonged chest wall pain and 142 (76\%) had prolonged disability. Among 111 patients with isolated rib fractures, 67 (64\%) had prolonged chest wall pain and 69 (66\%) had prolonged disability. MPQ PPI was predictive of prolonged pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 2.5), and prolonged disability (OR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.5 to 3.4). The presence of significant associated injuries was predictive of prolonged disability (OR, 5.9; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 29). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged chest wall pain is common, and the contribution of rib fractures to disability is greater than traditionally expected. Further investigation into more effective therapies that prevent prolonged pain and disability after rib fractures is needed.},

DESIGN: Quantitative Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: 14 powerlifters, 10 Olympic weightlifters and six physical therapists. SETTING: The lifters were recorded simultaneously by video and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) system while performing squats and deadlifts. The physical therapists assessed the videos and rated whether specific lumbo-pelvic movements were visible during the lifts and whether the movement amplitude was considered injurious. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The nominal visual assessments, if there was a movement and if it was considered injurious, were compared to the degrees of movement attained from the IMU system. RESULTS: During the squat, a posterior pelvic tilt of {$\geq$}34{\textdegree} was required to visually detect the movement. For other lumbo-pelvic movements, there was no significant difference in the amount of movement between those who were assessed as moving or not moving their lumbo-pelvic area, nor was there a difference in movement amplitude between those who were assessed as having an increased risk of injury or not. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapists did not consistently detect lumbo-pelvic movements during squats and deadlifts when performed by competitive lifters.},

Relationship between the type of surfing practiced and the onset of pain is not fully understood as well as the potential role of rehabilitation in preventing it. OBJECTIVE: To investigate musculoskeletal pain and to deepen whether the age and the anatomical region involved influenced the pain appearance in relation to four surfing disciplines. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out. An online survey was addressed to a group of Italian surfers (practicing surf, kitesurf, windsurf and stand up paddle since at least 1 year), collecting demographic data, discipline practiced, location of musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six surfers were involved in the study. Spine and upper limbs pain was more frequent compared to lower limbs one in the surf (p{$<$} 0.001) and in the windsurf groups (p= 0.007). In the kitesurf group a greater prevalence of pain was observed in spine and lower limbs compared to upper limbs (p= 0.017). Low back pain is the most represented among the spine pain subgroups (p{$<$} 0.001). Pain was lower in younger athletes (p= 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding risk factors and biomechanics of musculoskeletal pain is essential to realize prevention training strategies. Rehabilitation in sinergy with specific training allows pain-free activity, optimizing its overall health benefits.},

J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 260-271, 2017-Despite the increased professionalism and substantial growth of surfing worldwide, there is limited information available to practitioners and coaches in terms of key performance analytics that are common in other field-based sports. Indeed, research analyzing surfing performance is limited to a few studies examining male surfers' heart rates, surfing activities through time-motion analysis (TMA) using video recordings and Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) data during competition and recreational surfing. These studies have indicated that specific activities undertaken during surfing are unique with a variety of activities (i.e., paddling, resting, wave riding, breath holding, and recovery of surfboard in the surf). Furthermore, environmental and wave conditions also seem to influence the physical demands of competition surfing. It is due to these demands that surfers are required to have a high cardiorespiratory fitness, high muscular endurance, and considerable strength and anaerobic power, particular within the upper torso. By exploring various methods of performance analysis used within other sports, it is possible to improve our understanding of surfing demands. In so doing this will assist in the development of protocols and strategies to assess physiological characteristics of surfers, monitor athlete performance, improve training prescription, and identify talent. Therefore, this review explores the current literature to provide insights into methodological protocols, delimitations of research into athlete analysis and an overview of surfing dynamics. Specifically, this review will describe and review the use of TMA, GPS, and other technologies (i.e., HR) that are used in external and internal load monitoring as they pertain to surfing.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Two important changes have been made to the recent                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) diagnostic criteria: the criteria that conversion symptoms must be shown to be involuntary and occurring as the consequence of a recent stressor have been dropped. Outcome studies show that the rate of misdiagnosis has declined precipitously since the 1970s and is now around 4\%. Functional neuroimaging has revealed a fairly consistent pattern of hypoactivation in brain regions linked to the specific conversion symptom, accompanied by ancillary activations in limbic, paralimbic, and basal ganglia structures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy looks promising as the psychological treatment of choice, although more definitive data are still awaited, while preliminary evidence indicates that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could prove beneficial as well.                                                        SUMMARY               Symptoms of conversion are common in neurologic and psychiatric settings, affecting up to 20\% of patients. The full syndrome of conversion disorder, while less prevalent, is associated with a guarded prognosis and a troubled psychosocial outcome. Much remains uncertain with respect to etiology, although advances in neuroscience and technology are providing reproducible findings and new insights. Given the confidence with which the diagnosis can be made, treatment should not be delayed, as symptom longevity can influence outcome.},

RECENT FINDINGS               As updated methods become available to neurologists, the ability to accurately identify and treat patients with memory disorders evolves. An appreciation of current concepts in the anatomic, physiologic, and psychological aspects of memory, combined with a rational application of everyday tools (such as clinical examination, bedside testing, standardized cognitive screening, and formal neuropsychological examination), allows the clinician to identify possible etiologies and track longitudinal changes in functional memory status. Recent findings regarding the interactions of limbic, anterior temporal, primary sensory, parietal, and dorsal prefrontal structures shed new light on the putative classifications of procedural and declarative memory and their subfunctions.

By combining elements of the history with examination, the goal is to identify patterns and an effective differential diagnosis for this group of patients to help lead to an accurate diagnosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past dozen years have changed the historical approach to patients with dizziness from one based primarily on how the patient describes the sensation of dizziness. This older approach can lead to misdiagnosis, so a preferred method puts greater emphasis on whether the dizziness is acute or chronic, episodic or continuous, or evoked by or brought on by an event or circumstance so that a pattern may be derived that better narrows the differential diagnosis and focused examination can further narrow to a cause or causes.

Recent Findings:               Improved methods of diagnosing patients with vertigo and dizziness have been evolving, including additional diagnostic criteria and characterization of some common conditions that cause dizziness (eg, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, chronic subjective dizziness). Other uncommon causes of dizziness (eg, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, episodic ataxia type 2) have also been better clarified. Distinguishing between central and peripheral causes of vertigo can be accomplished reliably through history and examination, but imaging techniques have further added to accuracy. What has not changed is the necessity of obtaining a basic history of the patient's symptoms to narrow the list of possible causes.                                         Summary:               Dizziness and vertigo are extremely common symptoms that also affect function at home and at work.

RECENT FINDINGS               Gene therapies have become a reality for several neuromuscular disorders. Exon-skipping and (in Europe) ribosomal read-through approaches are currently available to a subset of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Microdystrophin gene replacement has shown promise and is nearing the final stages of clinical trials. Numerous gene-based therapies for other muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are progressing toward approval as well.                                         SUMMARY               Muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogenous group of hereditary muscle disorders. Confirming a diagnosis with genetic testing is not only critical for guiding management, but also an actual prerequisite for current and future gene therapies. Recessive loss-of-function or dominant haploinsufficiency disorders may be treated with gene replacement strategies, whereas dominant negative and toxic gain-of-function disorders are best addressed with a variety of knockdown approaches. It is important to recognize that many therapeutics are mutation specific and will only benefit a subset of individuals with a specific disease.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Rather than a disease, a disease process, or relating to specific cellular vulnerability, the term                 hereditary myelopathy                 refers to diverse inherited disorders in which major aspects of the clinical syndrome reflect disturbance of elements within the spinal cord (specifically, the dorsal columns and dorsal root ganglia, corticospinal tracts, and anterior horn cells). It is important to note that the clinical features of almost all hereditary myelopathies reflect not only disturbance of elements within the spinal cord but also disturbance of extraspinal structures (particularly, but not limited to, peripheral nerves and the cerebellum) and that these extraspinal clinical features can be very helpful in recognizing specific myelopathy syndromes. The value of classifying disorders as inherited myelopathies lies primarily in facilitating their clinical recognition and differential diagnosis. It is useful to recognize that many hereditary myelopathies conform to one of four clinical paradigms: (1) spinocerebellar ataxia, (2) motor neuron disorder, (3) leukodystrophy, or (4) distal motor-sensory axonopathy predominantly affecting the central nervous system. Although they are myelopathies, spinal dysraphisms such as spina bifida and myelomeningocele are not included in this context because they are not usually due to single-gene mutation and have low hereditability.                                                        SUMMARY               This article illustrates clinical paradigms of hereditary myelopathy with clinical examples emphasizing the spectrum, clinical recognition, and differential diagnosis of hereditary myelopathies.},

This article also provides an overview of the emerging clinical scenarios in which paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders may occur.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The number of autoantibodies associated with paraneoplastic neurologic disorders has rapidly expanded over the past 2 decades. These discoveries have improved our ability to diagnose patients with these disorders and have provided insight into their pathogenesis. It is now recognized that these antibodies can be broadly divided into two major categories based on the location of the target antigen: intracellular and cell surface/synaptic. Antibodies to intracellular antigens are almost always accompanied by cancer, respond less well to immunotherapy, and have an unfavorable outcome. In contrast, antibodies to cell surface or synaptic targets are less often accompanied by cancer, generally respond well to immunotherapy, and have a good prognosis. Paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders are now being recognized in novel settings, including their occurrence as an immune-related adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for cancer.                                         SUMMARY               This article discusses when to suspect a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, the diagnostic utility and pitfalls of neural autoantibody testing, how to best detect the underlying tumor, and the treatment approach that involves combinations of antineoplastic treatments, immunosuppressants, and supportive/symptomatic treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Unruptured intracranial aneurysms and vascular malformations are detected more frequently because of the increased use and availability of brain imaging. Management of these entities requires knowledge of which patients are at high risk for hemorrhage and what treatment options are available. This article summarizes the epidemiology, natural history, and management strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, developmental venous anomalies, and capillary telangiectasias.                                         Recent Findings:               Pooled cohort studies and meta-analyses have improved the ability to predict hemorrhage for each vascular abnormality. Scores and tools have been developed to aid the practitioner in predicting hemorrhage risk for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Advances in endovascular techniques for unruptured intracranial aneurysms have improved the ability to treat difficult wide-necked aneurysms.                                         Summary:               Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are a common incidental finding. The PHASES (population, hypertension, age, size of aneurysm, earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage from another aneurysm, site of aneurysm) score and Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Score may be useful tools for predicting natural history and treatment recommendations. The overall risk of hemorrhage for both arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations is about 2\% to 4\% per year. With both of these entities, prior hemorrhage predicts future hemorrhage. In addition, other select patient and radiologic factors influence risk of hemorrhage. The risk of future hemorrhage should be compared to the risk of treatment. Developmental venous anomalies and capillary telangiectasias are largely benign entities and rarely symptomatic.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with primary malignant brain tumors generally have a poor prognosis and experience progressive neurologic decline and significant physical and psychological symptoms. Management of these symptoms, including fatigue, mood disorders, and the manifestations of cerebral edema, can be challenging. Caregivers for these patients have high rates of psychological distress and report significant caregiving burden. Although the benefit of early palliative care for patients with other advanced solid tumors is well established, our understanding of the role of palliative care in neuro-oncology is incomplete, and thus palliative care and hospice services remain underutilized.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with brain tumors and their caregivers have significant supportive care needs, which often differ from the needs of patients with cancers outside of the nervous system. Clinicians face challenges associated with managing patients' symptoms and adequately facilitating prognostic understanding and decision making. Palliative care and hospice services may offer important benefits for this population.},

Performance of two aerial variations (Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR)) was also measured, with variables relating to technical performance (critical feature and subjective ratings) and potential injury risk (relative total peak landing force and loading rates) collected. Multiple linear regressions were used to predict performance of both aerial variations based on a subset of independent variables. Four models could predict performance. Predicted technical capability in the FAR was mostly influenced by lead limb hip extension and lead limb knee flexion range of motion. Potential injury risk when surfers perform an FA and FAR was predicted to be mitigated by increasing lead ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, as well as trail hip extensor mobility to reduce the relative total peak force experienced when landing the FA. These simple outcome measures could be routinely assessed to ensure successful and safe aerial landings in surfing.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(10): 3003-3011, 2020-To successfully and safely perform surfing maneuvers, surfers and their coaches need to know how to perform each maneuver correctly. Although some components of the sport are well understood, evidence-based recommendations in the scientific literature on how to perform surfing skills are sparse. The aim of this article was to systematically review the body of literature pertaining to discrete wave-riding skills and characteristics that are associated with the ability of surfers to successfully perform them. Searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus with Full-text, and Web of Science were undertaken in January 2019, to identify the most appropriate literature, with secondary searches of reference lists used to create a greater pool of possible articles. The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Ten studies deemed appropriate for review captured data from 299 surfers, who were predominantly competitive (78.3\%) and male (58.2\%). The average Down and Black Quality Index of the articles was 76.3 {$\pm$} 8.4\%, with these articles focusing on the "pop-up" and landing skills. Performance indicators, such as isometric push-up peak forces, force-plate derived and in-water time to pop-up, relative peak forces generated when landing and time-to-stabilization, were all shown to be related to the physical characteristics of surfers and could affect the ability of surfers to successfully ride a wave. Findings from the studies included in this review suggest that the pop-up and landing exhibit trainable qualities that coaches and athletes can use to improve surfing performance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Physical preparation of competitive surfers includes substantial dry-land training. It is currently unknown, however, how closely these exercises replicate surfing maneuvers performed in the ocean. This study compared the technique features displayed by surfers when landing simulated aerial maneuvers on land to critical features previously established as necessary for surfers to successfully land aerials in the ocean during competition. METHODS: Fourteen competitive surfers (age 20.6~{$\pm~$}5.7~years, height 178.1~{$\pm~$}9.50~cm, mass 70.6~{$\pm~$}10.8~kg) were recruited to perform two variations of a simulated aerial task, a Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR). Joint ranges of motion (ROM), center of pressure, and apparent gaze data were collected during the landing event. Paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to identify any significant differences in the outcome variables between the two aerial tasks. RESULTS: Participants displayed 100\% and 60\% of the critical features associated with successfully landing a FA and FAR, respectively. In both the simulated FA and FAR, participants landed in 1.0-3.7{\textdegree} of dorsiflexion, moving through significantly less ankle joint ROM in the lead limb during the FAR (P~{$<~$}.01). Participants also displayed significantly less knee and hip ROM (P~=~.002-.048) while landing the FAR compared to the FA. CONCLUSION: The simulated FA and FAR tasks are appropriate training tools for surfers to replicate most of the critical features that a surfer should display to successfully land aerial maneuvers in the ocean. These tasks therefore enable surfers to practice these complex movements in a controlled environment.},

Survivors of childhood stroke and their families are often left to cope with long-lasting sequelae, such as barriers to school reentry and long-term challenges in attaining independence as adults. Because childhood stroke is rare and providers may not be familiar with the disorder, this article reviews the risk factors, acute management, and sequelae of ischemic stroke in children.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               High-quality evidence has resulted in an organized approach to emergent treatment of ischemic stroke in adults, but most front-line providers are less prepared for emergent stroke management in children. The level of evidence for reperfusion therapies in children remains low but is growing. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are sometimes considered for hyperacute treatment of stroke in children. Readiness for pediatric stroke at regional centers should include an organized approach to pediatric stroke triage and management based on extrapolation from adult stroke trials, expert consensus, and emerging pediatric studies.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               This review provides up-to-date information about ischemic stroke risk factors and management in children.

While the headaches resulting from intracranial pressure disorders have what are conventionally thought of as defining characteristics, a substantial minority of patients do not manifest the ``typical'' features. Moreover, patients with intracranial pressure disorders may also have a preexisting primary headache disorder. Heightening the complexity of the presentation, the headaches of intracranial pressure disorders can resemble the phenotype of a primary disorder. Lastly, patients with so-called intracranial ``hypotension'' often have normal CSF pressure and neuroimaging studies. Thus, a high index of suspicion is needed. The published literature has inherent bias as many types of specialists evaluate and treat these conditions. This article reviews the key points to emphasize the history, examination, and laboratory evaluation of patients with intracranial pressure disorders from a neurologist's perspective.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Lumbar puncture opening pressure in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension was low enough to meet diagnostic criteria ({$\leq$}60 mm CSF) in only 34\% of patients in one study. Most patients had an opening pressure in the low normal to normal range, and 5\% had an opening pressure of 200 mm CSF or more. Diskogenic microspurs are a common cause of this syndrome. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial found that most participants had a headache phenotype resembling migraine or tension-type headache. No ``typical'' or characteristic headache phenotype was found, and headache-related disability was severe at baseline. Headache disability did not correlate with the lumbar puncture opening pressure at baseline or at the 6-month primary outcome period. Although participants who were randomly assigned to acetazolamide had a lower mean CSF opening pressure at 6 months, headache disability in that group was similar to the group who received placebo.                                         SUMMARY               Significant overlap is seen in the symptoms of high and low CSF pressure disorders and in those of primary headache disorders. Neurologists are frequently challenged by patients with headaches who lack the typical clinical signs or imaging features of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome or spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Even when characteristic symptoms and signs are initially present, the typical features of both syndromes tend to lessen or resolve over time; consider these diagnoses in patients with long-standing ``chronic migraine'' who do not improve with conventional headache treatment. While the diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cerebri syndrome accurately identify most patients with the disorder, at least 25\% of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension have normal imaging and over half have a normal lumbar puncture opening pressure. Detailed history taking will often give clues that suggest a CSF pressure disorder. That said, misdiagnosis can lead to significant patient morbidity and inappropriate therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The major advance in the field of tardive syndromes has been the development and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, for treating tardive syndromes. These medications are derivatives of tetrabenazine and reduce dyskinetic movements by reducing dopamine stimulation. Treatment is not curative, and the medications reduce, or ``mask,'' symptoms but presumably without adding to the long-term risk of increased involuntary movements believed to accrue from suppressive treatment with dopamine receptor{\textendash}blocking drugs. A confounding advance has been the accumulation of data finding that second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, may not be safer than first-generation antipsychotics in causing tardive syndromes. The public health risk of tardive syndromes may actually have increased as some second-generation antipsychotics, widely promoted to both doctors and patients, are increasingly used as antidepressants.                                         SUMMARY               Tardive syndromes remain a public health risk. Second-generation antipsychotics have not been proven to have less risk than first-generation drugs in causing tardive syndromes and are nevertheless being used more widely to treat depression, bipolar disease, and insomnia. Symptomatic treatment for tardive syndromes is available, although expensive.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal management of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults with acute ACL injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of later ACL reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)--pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS(4); range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five KOOS subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner Activity Scale. RESULTS: Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS(4) score from baseline to 2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95\% confidence interval, -6.5 to 6.8; P=0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received. CONCLUSIONS: In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency of surgical reconstructions.

RECENT FINDINGS               Major advances have occurred in recognizing the genetic basis of nervous system malformations. Environmental causes of nervous system malformations, such as perinatal infections including Zika virus, are also reviewed. Treatment for nervous system malformations begins prior to birth with prevention. Folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects and is an important part of health maintenance for pregnant women. Fetal surgery is now available for prenatal repair of myelomeningocele and has been demonstrated to improve outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Each type of nervous system malformation is relatively uncommon, but, collectively, they constitute a large population of neurologic patients. The diagnosis of nervous system malformations begins with radiographic characterization. Genetic studies, including chromosomal microarray, targeted gene sequencing, and next-generation sequencing, are increasingly important aspects of the assessment. A genetic diagnosis may identify an associated medical condition and is necessary for family planning. Treatment consists primarily of supportive therapies for developmental delays and epilepsy, but prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele offers a glimpse of future possibilities. Prognosis depends on multiple clinical factors, including the examination findings, imaging characteristics, and genetic results. Treatment is best conducted in a multidisciplinary setting with neurology, neurosurgery, developmental pediatrics, and genetics working together as a comprehensive team.},

  abstract = {Context: Surfer's myelopathy (SM) is an acute syndrome identified by nontraumatic paraparesis or paraplegia. Though traditionally tied to first-time surfers, the condition encompasses any activity involving hyperextension of the back such as gymnastics, yoga, and Pilates.Methods: MEDLINE{\textregistered} and Google Scholar literature searches were gathered to identify relevant case reports for determining the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of SM.Results: While the rare nature of SM limits its full understanding, studies have pinpointed that hyperextension in the back leads to vasculature insufficiency secondary to dynamic compression of the artery of Adamkiewicz. In surfing, this hyperextension combined with the execution of the Valsalva maneuver while trying to stand up on the surfboard likely increases intraspinal pressure. Due to its nontraumatic origin, the presence of SM is not immediately clear. Moreover, its similarity in clinical and radiological presentations with other entities can further complicate diagnosis. Seemingly, idiopathic urological symptoms can be explained by the physician if they conduct a thorough history.Conclusion: In an effort to raise awareness for the practicing physician, we presently review the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prolonged effects of SM. With the surging popularity of surfing as well as the advent of children participating in precarious sports and activities at an earlier age, we can expect a rising incidence of traumatic and nontraumatic spinal cord injuries. Neurologists, urologists, emergency medicine and sports medicine physicians alike can utilize this review to build a high index of suspicion for SM. The risk factors for SM should be conveyed to those participating in novices in surfing, yoga, gymnastics, ballet, and any activity enabling sustained or repeated spinal extension. Increased general awareness will facilitate increased symptom recognition in order to arrest aggravation of injury.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Parasitic infections in humans are common, and many can affect the central nervous system where they may survive unnoticed or may cause significant pathology that can even lead to the death of the host. Neuroparasitoses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurologic lesions, particularly in individuals from endemic regions or those with a history of travel to endemic regions.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebral malaria is a significant cause of mortality, particularly in African children, in whom infected red blood cells affect the cerebral vessels, causing severe encephalopathy. Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide and has varied clinical presentations, depending on the number, size, and location of the parasites in the nervous system as well as on the host's inflammatory response. Toxoplasmosis is distributed worldwide, affecting a significant proportion of the population, and may reactivate in patients who are immunosuppressed, causing encephalitis and focal abscesses. Schistosomiasis causes granulomatous lesions in the brain or the spinal cord.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Four triptans are now labeled by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute migraine treatment in adolescents, and rizatriptan is labeled for use in children age 6 and older. For preventive migraine treatment, the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial demonstrated that approximately 60\% of children and adolescents with migraine will improve with a three-pronged treatment approach that includes: (1) lifestyle management counseling (on sleep, exercise, hydration, caffeine, and avoidance of meal skipping); (2) optimally dosed acute therapy, specifically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans; and (3) a preventive treatment that has some evidence for efficacy. For the remaining 40\% of children and adolescents, and for those who would not have qualified for the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial because of having continuous headache or medication-overuse headache, the clinician's judgment remains the best guide to preventive therapy selection.

This article reviews the unique contributions of renal impairment to neurologic disorders and their common clinical manifestations as the prevalence of renal disease increases in a globally aging population.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENT                                Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic interplay between the kidneys and brain, also referred to as the                 kidney-brain axis                 , have led to more widespread recognition of associated changes in neurovascular dynamics, central nervous system acidification, and uremia-associated endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Acute kidney injury increases mortality in acute brain injury to nearly 5 times that seen in matched controls. Renal impairment and its associated increased risks of intracerebral hemorrhage and accelerated cognitive decline are developing fields. Dialysis-associated neurovascular injury is increasingly recognized in both continuous and intermittent forms of renal replacement therapy, and treatment strategies for its prevention are evolving.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               This article summarizes the effects of renal impairment on the central and peripheral nervous systems with special considerations in acute kidney injury, patients requiring dialysis, and conditions that affect both the renal and nervous systems.},

  abstract = {The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like meclofenamate sodium (MS), used to reduce pain, has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Naproxen (NAP), another NSAID, is not associated with increased risk of CVD. The molecular mechanism(s) by which NSAIDs induce CVD is unknown. We investigated the effects of MS and NAP on protein homeostasis and cardiotoxicity in rat cardiac H9c2 cells and murine neonatal cardiomyocytes. MS, but not NAP, significantly inhibited proteasome activity and reduced cardiac cell viability at pharmacological levels found in humans. Although proteasome subunit gene and protein expression were unaffected by NSAIDs, MS treated cell lysates showed higher 20S proteasome content, while purified proteasomes from MS treated cells had lower proteasome activity and higher levels of oxidized subunits than proteasomes from control cells. Addition of exogenous proteasome to MS treated cells improved cell viability. Both MS and NAP increased ROS production, but the rate of ROS production was greater in MS than in NAP treated cells. The ROS production is likely from mitochondria, as MS inhibited mitochondrial Complexes I and III, major sources of ROS, while NAP inhibited Complex I. MS also impaired mitochondrial membrane potential while NAP did not. Antioxidants were able to prevent the reduced cell viability caused by MS treatment. These results suggest that NSAIDs induce cardiotoxicity by a ROS dependent mechanism involving mitochondrial and proteasome dysfunction and may explain why some NSAIDs should not be given to patients for long periods.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Despite the ubiquity of anxiety, the evidence is that most individuals with an anxiety disorder are not identified and do not receive guideline-level care. In part, this may be because of the manifold clinical presentations of anxiety disorders and clinicians' lack of confidence in accurately diagnosing and treating these conditions, especially in nonpsychiatric settings. Anxiety disorders represent the complex interplay between biological, psychological, temperamental, and environmental factors. Converging lines of evidence point to dysfunction in regulating activity in the ``threat circuit'' in the brain as a putative common pathophysiology underlying anxiety disorders. Evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications, have been shown to regulate activity in this circuit, which consists of reciprocal connections between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and amygdala.                                         SUMMARY               Anxiety disorders are the most common class of emotional disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. A variety of effective treatment strategies are available, which may exert their therapeutic benefits from top-down or bottom-up modulation of the dysfunctional brain activity associated with anxiety disorders.},

The standard methodology for completing a skin biopsy, the anatomic structures of interest detected within a skin biopsy, and the disease states in which skin biopsies may provide valuable information are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Several recent advances in the studies of hereditary amyloidosis and the various degenerative synucleinopathies have demonstrated that simple skin biopsies can provide valuable pathologic evidence of neurologic disease. In addition to diagnosis of the underlying disorder, skin biopsies provide a quantitative structural measurement of the associated autonomic damage.                                         SUMMARY               Skin biopsies are making great inroads into the study of autonomic and peripheral nerve disorders. Complex immunohistochemical staining protocols are challenging to complete, but the rich data derived from these studies in the diagnosis and monitoring of different disease states suggest that the role of skin biopsies in the study of the autonomic nervous system will continue to expand in the years to come.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accuracy of the physical examination for tears of the long head of the biceps remains controversial. PURPOSE: The goals were 1) to characterize the occurrence of partial tears of the long head of the biceps tendon in a group of consecutive patients, and 2) to analyze the diagnostic value of various clinical tests for pathologic lesions of the proximal biceps tendon. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Of 847 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic procedures for a variety of shoulder conditions, 40 were found at the time of arthroscopy to have partial biceps tendon tears. The average age of these 24 men and 16 women was 59 years (range, 18-83). Preoperative physical examinations had included 9 commonly used tests for shoulder examination. Statistical analysis included sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and likelihood ratios for these tests. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of partial tears was 5\% (40/847) of all arthroscopic procedures. The most commonly associated conditions included rotator cuff tears (85\% [34/40]) and anterior instability (7.5\% [3/40]). Tenderness on palpation of the long head of the biceps tendon had a sensitivity of 53\%, a specificity of 54\%, and a likelihood ratio of 1.13. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratios for Speed's test were 50\%, 67\%, 8\%, 96\%, and 1.51, respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with rotator cuff abnormality, the diagnosis of partial biceps tears cannot be made reliably with existing physical examination tests. Diagnostic arthroscopy is recommended, if clinically indicated, for potential partial tears of the long head of the biceps tendon. The treating physician should be prepared to treat unsuspected tears of the long head of the biceps tendon at the time of surgery.},

The objectives of this study were to highlight key differences between interrater agreement and interrater reliability; describe the key concepts and approaches to evaluating interrater agreement and interrater reliability; and provide examples of their applications to research in the field of social and administrative pharmacy. This is a descriptive review of interrater agreement and interrater reliability indices. It outlines the practical applications and interpretation of these indices in social and administrative pharmacy research. Interrater agreement indices assess the extent to which the responses of 2 or more independent raters are concordant. Interrater reliability indices assess the extent to which raters consistently distinguish between different responses. A number of indices exist, and some common examples include Kappa, the Kendall coefficient of concordance, Bland-Altman plots, and the intraclass correlation coefficient. Guidance on the selection of an appropriate index is provided. In conclusion, selection of an appropriate index to evaluate interrater agreement or interrater reliability is dependent on a number of factors including the context in which the study is being undertaken, the type of variable under consideration, and the number of raters making assessments.},

The etiology is most often global hypoxia-ischemia due to failure of cerebral perfusion to the fetus caused by uterine, placental, or umbilical cord compromise prior to or during delivery. Other etiologies of neonatal encephalopathy include ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, infection, developmental anomalies, and inborn errors of metabolism.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Therapeutic hypothermia is standard of care for the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy presumed to be caused by hypoxia-ischemia. The number needed to treat is approximately 6 to 7 to prevent one child from either death or disability at age 18 to 22 months. EEG monitoring and MRI are important tools in determining the etiology of encephalopathy and prognosis of the infant.                                         SUMMARY               Neonatal encephalopathy is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by alterations in mental status, hypotonia, seizures, and abnormalities in feeding and respiration. The most common cause of neonatal encephalopathy is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, for which treatment with 72 hours of therapeutic hypothermia is associated with reduced death or disability.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of memory formation advances each year. Successful episodic memory formation depends not only on intact medial temporal lobe structures but also on well-orchestrated interactions with other large-scale brain networks that support executive and semantic processing functions. Recent discoveries of cognitive control networks have helped in understanding the interaction between memory systems and executive systems. These interactions allow access to past experiences and enable comparisons between past experiences and external and internal information. The semantic memory system is less clearly defined anatomically. Anterior, lateral, and inferior temporal lobe regions appear to play a crucial role in the function of the semantic processing system. Different but tightly interconnected cortical regions, such as the prefrontal region, may play a controlling role in this system. The presentation of clinical disease affecting memory is the result of the selective vulnerability of the memory system. An understanding of current concepts of memory anatomy, physiology, and evaluation plays a central role in establishing an accurate diagnosis.                                         SUMMARY               Different memory systems rely on separate but overlapping distributed brain networks. Certain pathologic processes preferentially affect memory systems.

Moreover, while some causes of diplopia are benign, others require immediate recognition, a focused diagnostic evaluation, and appropriate treatment to prevent vision- and life-threatening outcomes. A logical, easy-to-follow approach to the clinical evaluation of patients with diplopia is helpful in ensuring accurate localization, a comprehensive differential diagnosis, and optimal patient care. This article provides a foundation for formulating an approach to the patient with diplopia and includes practical examples of developing the differential diagnosis, effectively using confirmatory examination techniques, determining an appropriate diagnostic strategy, and (where applicable) providing effective treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent population-based analyses have determined that diplopia is a common presentation in both ambulatory and emergency department settings, with 850,000 such visits occurring annually. For patients presenting to an outpatient facility, diagnoses are rarely serious. However, potentially life-threatening causes (predominantly stroke or transient ischemic attack) can be encountered. In patients presenting with diplopia related to isolated cranial nerve palsy, immediate neuroimaging can often be avoided if an appropriate history and examination are used to exclude worrisome etiologies.                                         SUMMARY               Binocular diplopia is most often due to a neurologic cause. The onset of true ``double vision'' is debilitating for most patients and commonly prompts immediate access to health care services as a consequence of functional impairment and concern for worrisome underlying causes. Although patients may seek initial evaluation through the emergency department or from their primary care/ophthalmic provider, elimination of an ocular cause will not infrequently result in the patient being referred for neurologic consultation. A logical, localization-driven, and evidence-based approach is the most effective way to arrive at the correct diagnosis and provide the best outcome for the patient.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and motor syndromes are often intertwined in neurologic disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, atypical parkinsonian syndromes, Huntington disease, and other movement disorders. Cognitive symptoms often affect attention, working memory, and executive and visuospatial functions preferentially, rather than language and memory, but heterogeneity can be seen in the various movement disorders. A distinct cognitive syndrome has been recognized in patients with cerebellar syndromes. Appropriate recognition and screening for cognitive changes in movement disorders may play a role in achieving accurate diagnoses and guiding patients and their families regarding progression and management decisions.                                         SUMMARY               In the comprehensive care of patients with movement disorders, recognition of cognitive syndromes is important. Pharmacologic treatments for the cognitive syndromes, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia, in these movement disorders lag behind the therapeutics available for motor symptoms, and more research is needed. Patient evaluation and management require a comprehensive team approach, often linking neurologists as well as neuropsychologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other professionals.},

DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials, Scielo, and CINAHL (from the earliest date available to November 2014) for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of stabilization exercises compared to general exercises or manual therapy on pain, disability, and function in patients with low back pain. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria (413 stabilization exercises patients, 297 general exercises patients, and 185 manual therapy patients). Stabilization exercises may provide greater benefit than general exercise for pain reduction and improvement in disability. Stabilization exercise improved pain with a WMD of~-1.03 (95\% CI:~-1.29 to~-0.27) and improved disability with a WMD of~-5.41 (95\% CI:~-8.34 to~-2.49). There were no significant differences in pain and disability scores among participants in the stabilization exercise group compared to those in the manual therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization exercises were as efficacious as manual therapy in decreasing pain and disability and should be encouraged as part of musculoskeletal rehabilitation for low back pain.},

This article reviews cauda equina anatomy, the diagnostic approach to disorders of the cauda equina, features of cauda equina syndrome, and diskogenic and nondiskogenic disorders of the cauda equina.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing clinical criteria for cauda equina syndrome has been a focus of a number of reviews, although the clinician must maintain a low threshold for emergent imaging in cases of suspected cauda equina syndrome because of the suboptimal reliability of various signs and symptoms in identifying this condition clinically. The timing of surgical intervention for compressive causes of cauda equina dysfunction remains a point of contention, although urgent decompression remains standard practice. A recent review that focused on outcomes in patients with cauda equina compression who underwent surgical decompression identified significant residual deficits in patients despite appropriate and timely intervention. Autoimmune conditions targeting the cauda equina have been increasingly recognized, including chronic immune sensory polyradiculopathy and chronic immune sensorimotor polyradiculopathy.

To achieve this goal, a normal human heart must beat regularly and continuously for one's entire life. Heartbeats originate from the rhythmic pacing discharge from the sinoatrial (SA) node within the heart itself. In the absence of extrinsic neural or hormonal influences, the SA node pacing rate would be about 100 beats per minute. Heart rate and cardiac output, however, must vary in response to the needs of the body's cells for oxygen and nutrients under varying conditions. In order to respond rapidly to the changing requirements of the body's tissues, the heart rate and contractility are regulated by the nervous system, hormones, and other factors. Here we review how the cardiovascular system is controlled and influenced by not only a unique intrinsic system, but is also heavily influenced by the autonomic nervous system as well as the endocrine system.},

The spectrum of motor neuron diseases is reviewed, and the clinical heterogeneity of ALS is described.                                         Recent Findings:               ALS is increasingly recognized as a clinical spectrum disorder with pure upper and pure lower motor neuron presentations, supported by genetic links.

Summary:               ALS is a progressive fatal multisystem neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Clinical recognition of suspicious symptoms and the appropriate laboratory evaluation are essential to limit diagnostic delay and avoid unnecessary testing and procedures. ALS has broad genetic and hypothesized environmental causes and phenotypic variability. Recognizing related motor neuron diseases will prevent misdiagnosis while allowing proper disease counseling. Although ALS cannot be cured, implementation of appropriate symptomatic treatment is valuable.},

RECENT FINDINGS               IBM is an often-misdiagnosed myopathy subtype. Due to the insidious onset and slow progression of muscle weakness, it can often be dismissed as a sign of aging as it commonly presents in older adults. While challenging to recognize upon initial clinical evaluation, the recent recognition of specialized stains highlighting features seen on muscle pathology, the use of diagnostic tools such as the anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A antibody biomarker, and the ability of muscle imaging to detect patterns of preferential muscle involvement seen in IBM has allowed for earlier diagnosis of the disease than was previously possible. While the pathogenesis of IBM has historically been poorly understood, several ongoing studies point toward mechanisms of autophagy and highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells that are postulated to be pathogenic in IBM.

New studies have shed light on its epidemiology and pathogenesis and provided objective ways to measure outcome in patients with NPH. Neuroimaging has improved and allows better recognition of both NPH and the presence of overlapping diseases                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Several recent epidemiologic studies confirm that NPH is a rare disease, but the presence of large ventricles is a common finding with aging. NPH may be multifactorial, including congenital causes, vascular disease, and impaired CSF absorption. MRI features of NPH include enlarged ventricular size and CSF fluid collection outside the ventricles not due to atrophy. The term                 disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus                 (DESH) has been used to describe prognostic MRI features in NPH, including a ``tight high convexity'' and enlargement of CSF spaces in the sylvian fissure. DESH has been included in the Japanese guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of NPH. A new NPH scale has been published that provides an objective framework for evaluating patients with NPH before and after shunt placement. Programmable shunts can noninvasively manage overdrainage complications. Surgical outcome has been improving over time. Recent studies have led to improved recognition of overlapping diseases such as Alzheimer pathology, which co-occurs in about 30\% of NPH cases. Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a promising imaging modality for diagnosing NPH and detecting concomitant degenerative disease.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an important need to evaluate whether rehabilitation services effectively address the needs of minority culture populations with North America's increasingly diverse population. The objective of this paper was therefore to review and assess the state of knowledge of barriers and facilitators to cultural competence in rehabilitation services. METHOD: Our scoping review focused on cultural competence in rehabilitation services. Rehabilitation services included in this review were: audiology, speech-language pathology, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. A search strategy was developed to identify relevant articles published from inception of databases until April 2015. Titles and abstracts were screened by two independent reviewers according to specific eligibility criteria with the use of a liberal-accelerated approach. Full-text articles meeting inclusion criteria were then screened. Key study characteristics were abstracted by the first reviewer, and findings were verified by the second reviewer. RESULTS: After duplicates were removed, 4303 citations were screened. Included articles suggest that studies on cultural competence occur most frequently in occupational therapy (n\,=\,17), followed by speech language pathology (n\,=\,11), physiotherapy (n\,=\,6), and finally audiology (n\,=\,1). Primary barriers in rehabilitation services include language barriers, limited resources, and cultural barriers. Primary facilitators include cultural awareness amongst practitioners, cultural awareness in services, and explanations of health care systems. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this review is the first to summarize barriers and facilitators to cultural competence in rehabilitation fields. Insufficient studies were found to draw any conclusions with regards to audiological services. Minimal perspectives based on patient/caregiver experiences in all rehabilitation fields underscore a research gap. Future studies should aim to explore both patient/caregiver and practitioner perspectives as such data can help inform culturally competent practices.},

The difficulty of rethinking our assumptions is surprisingly common--maybe even fundamentally human. Our ways of thinking become habits that we don't bother to question, and mental laziness leads us to prefer the ease of old routines to the difficulty of new ones. We fail to update the beliefs we formed in the past for the challenges we face in the present. But in a rapidly changing world, we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking. Think Again is a book about the benefit of doubt, and about how we can get better at embracing the unknown and the joy of being wrong. Evidence has shown that creative geniuses are not attached to one identity but constantly willing to rethink their stances, that leaders who admit they don't know something and seek critical feedback lead more productive and innovative teams, and that our greatest presidents have been open to updating their views. The new science of intellectual humility shows that as a mindset and a skillset, rethinking can be taught, and Grant explains how to develop the necessary qualities. The first section of the book explores why we struggle to think again and how we can improve individually, and argues that such engines of success as "grit" can actually be counterproductive; the second section discusses how we can help others think again through the skill of "argument literacy"; and the third looks at how institutions like schools, business, and governments fall short in building cultures that encourage rethinking. In the end, it's intellectual humility that makes it possible for us to stop denying our weaknesses so that we can start improving ourselves"--},

Each of these disorders eventually develops signs and symptoms that distinguish it from idiopathic Parkinson disease, but these may not be present at disease onset. Although these conditions are not generally treatable, it is still important to correctly diagnose the condition as soon as possible.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               In recent years, it has been increasingly recognized that the symptoms of these diseases do not accurately predict the pathology, and the pathology does not accurately predict the clinical syndrome. Despite this, interest has grown in treating these diseases by targeting misfolded tau (in the case of PSP and CBD) and misfolded {$\alpha$}-synuclein (in the case of MSA).

  abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Some microorganisms exhibit neurotropism for the spinal cord (eg, enteroviruses such as poliovirus and flaviviruses such as West Nile virus), while others are more protean in neurologic manifestations (eg, herpesviruses such as varicella-zoster virus), and others are only rarely reported to cause myelopathy (eg, certain fungal and parasitic infections). Individuals who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of disseminated infection to the central nervous system. Within the last few years, an enterovirus D68 outbreak has been associated with cases of acute flaccid paralysis in children, and emerging Zika virus infection has been concurrent with cases of acute flaccid paralysis due to Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, although cases of myelitis have also been reported. Associated pathogens differ by geographic distribution, with myelopathies related to                 Borrelia burgdorferi                 (Lyme disease) and West Nile virus more commonly seen in the United States and parasitic infections encountered more often in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Neurologic complications of HIV may be caused by direct virally mediated pathology, immune-mediated phenomena in response to viral infection, or opportunistic infections secondary to depletion of lymphocytes. These neurologic disorders may be influenced by the degree of immunosuppression (ie, CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte count) and stage of infection (early versus late), as well as use of antiretroviral therapy, and may manifest as a variety of central and peripheral neurologic syndromes, including the more commonly encountered HIV-associated cognitive disorders and length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy, respectively. Immune dysregulation underlies the majority of these neurologic phenomena, as well as other HIV-associated conditions including immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), CD8 lymphocytosis, and potentially the development of compartmentalized infection within the CSF, also referred to as                 CSF escape                 .

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Magnesium plays a key role in bone health and may, therefore, represent an interesting nutrient for the prevention of bone loss and osteoporosis. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of magnesium intake from any source on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone turnover markers, and fracture risk in older adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Embase, Medline Ovid and Cochrane Central from database inception to October 2020. All studies that related magnesium intake with bone health outcomes among adults aged {$\geq$}60~years were included. Two investigators independently conducted abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments. Authors were contacted for missing data. RESULTS: Once 787 records were screened, six cohort studies, one case-control study and five cross-sectional studies were included. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated a positive trend between higher magnesium intake and higher hip and femoral neck BMD. Meta-analysis of four studies showed a significant positive association between magnesium intake and hip BMD (pooled beta: 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.01-0.06, p~{$<~$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that a higher magnesium intake may support an increase in hip and femoral neck BMD. Due to limited research no associations with BMD at other sites or fractures were found. There is a need for properly designed cohort studies to determine the association between magnesium intake and bone health in older adults. Next, large and long-term randomized controlled trials in older adults are needed to determine whether an increase in magnesium (supplementation) intake can improve bone health. The combination of several bone nutrients (calcium, vitamin D, protein, magnesium and potentially more) may be needed for the most optimal effect on bone health and to delay or prevent the development of osteoporosis.},

This article reviews the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, diagnostic workup, novel pathophysiologic insights, and treatment of immunocompetent patients with primary CNS lymphoma.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The prognosis of primary CNS lymphoma has significantly improved over the past few decades because of the introduction of and widespread use of high-dose methotrexate, which is now the backbone of all first-line combination chemotherapy treatments. Despite this progress, durable remission is still observed in only approximately 50\% of patients. Novel insights into the pathophysiology of primary CNS lymphoma have identified the B-cell receptor pathway as well as the suppressed tumor immune microenvironment and immune evasion as key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of primary CNS lymphoma. Novel, small molecules and agents targeting these aberrant pathways have been introduced into clinical trials of recurrent/refractory primary CNS lymphomas. Agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib or immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide have shown promising response rates in the relapsed setting.                                         SUMMARY               Diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma requires a high level of suspicion because clinical signs and deficits can vary and depend on the involved CNS compartments. Rapid initiation of therapy is essential for recovery and prognosis. The optimal treatment regimen has not been defined, but methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens are considered the standard treatment approach for induction treatment. Novel, targeted agents have recently been introduced into the therapeutic arsenal.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The growing use of factor Xa inhibitors has increasingly caused patients with stroke to be excluded from treatment with IV thrombolysis. Important geographic, socioeconomic, sex, race, and ethnic disparities have been identified in the implementation of IV thrombolysis and need to be overcome. IV thrombolysis substantially improves outcomes when provided within the first golden hour after stroke onset in patients treated in mobile stroke units, supporting the ``time is brain'' concept and encouraging the possible value of more widespread implementation of the mobile stroke unit approach. At the same time, other studies have shown that IV thrombolysis can be successful in patients whose ``tissue clock'' is still ticking up to 9 hours after stroke onset or in patients who awaken with their stroke, as demonstrated by favorable imaging profiles. These considerations, along with the emergence of endovascular thrombectomy, have fostered examination of our care systems, including the ``drip and ship'' versus direct to comprehensive or endovascular thrombectomy stroke center approaches, as well as the possibility of skipping IV thrombolysis in certain patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy. Data suggesting that tenecteplase is at least noninferior to alteplase, as well as its more convenient dosing, has led to its increased use. Ongoing studies are evaluating newer thrombolytics and adding antithrombotic therapy to IV thrombolysis.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               IV thrombolysis remains the most common acute stroke treatment. Advances in acting faster to treat stroke have increased its efficacy, and advances in imaging have expanded its use. However, implementing these advances and overcoming disparities in IV thrombolysis use remain major challenges.},

We sought to compare short-term and long-term effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment in sciatica symptom severity and quality of life in patients with lumbar disc herniation in a routine clinical setting. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of a routine clinical practice registry consisting of 370 patients. Outcome measures were the North American Spine Society questionnaire and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey to assess patient-reported back pain, physical function, neurogenic symptoms and quality of life. Primary outcomes were back pain at 6 and 12\hspace{0.25em}weeks. Standard open discectomy was assessed versus conservative interventions at 6, 12, 52 and 104\hspace{0.25em}weeks. We filled in missing outcome variable values with multiple imputation, accounted for repeated measures within patients with mixed-effects models and adjusted baseline group differences in relevant prognostic indicators by inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Surgical treatment patients reported less back pain at 6 weeks than those receiving conservative therapy (-0.97; 95\% CI -1.89 to -0.09), were more likely to report {$\geq$}50\% decrease in back pain symptoms from baseline to 6\hspace{0.25em}weeks (48\% vs 17\%, risk difference: 0.34; 95\% CI 0.16 to 0.47) and reported less physical function disability at 52\hspace{0.25em}weeks (-3.7; 95\% CI -7.4 to -0.1). The other assessments showed minimal between-group differences with CIs, including the null effect. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conservative therapy, surgical treatment provided faster relief from back pain symptoms in patients with lumbar disc herniation, but did not show a benefit over conservative treatment in midterm and long-term follow-up.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The suspicion that LEMS is rare but also likely underdiagnosed is supported by recent epidemiologic data. A validated, LEMS-specific scale now exists to assess and monitor disease, and symptomatic and immunomodulatory treatments are available. As presynaptic disorders of neuromuscular transmission, LEMS and botulism share electrodiagnostic abnormalities but have important distinguishing features. Knowledge of the clinical features of botulism is needed, particularly with continued cases of infant botulism, the opioid epidemic increasing the incidence of wound botulism, and medical use of botulinum toxin, which may cause iatrogenic botulism. Foodborne botulism remains rare. Prompt recognition of botulism and administration of antitoxin can improve outcomes. MG may be exacerbated or may present de novo in the context of immune activation from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies for cancer. Immune-related MG commonly overlaps with myositis and myocarditis. Corticosteroids typically result in improvement. However, immune-related MG can be more fulminant than its idiopathic counterpart and may cause permanent disability or death.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis of LEMS, botulism, or immune-related MG can generally be made from the patient's history, supplemented with directed questions, a physical examination designed to demonstrate abnormalities, and laboratory and electrodiagnostic testing. Early diagnosis and carefully selected treatment not only improve outcomes of the neuromuscular disease but can affect the prognosis of underlying malignancy, when present.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Death from stroke has decreased over the past decade, with stroke now the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. In addition, the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality, many strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as lifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical inactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management of each of these modifiable risk factors.                                         Recent Findings:               It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may increase variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for stroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an indication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting use of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as obstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a), are discussed.                                         Summary:               Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial approach. This article incorporates evidence from guidelines and published studies and uses an illustrative case study throughout the article to provide examples of secondary prevention management of stroke risk factors.},

To simplify the approach to this category of patients, sensory-predominant polyneuropathies are divided broadly into either small fiber (or pain-predominant) neuropathies and large fiber (or ataxia-predominant) neuropathies, of which the sensory neuronopathies (dorsal root ganglionopathies) are highlighted.                                         Recent Findings:               Physicians can now easily perform skin biopsies in their offices, allowing access to the gold standard pathologic diagnostic tool for small fiber neuropathies. Additional diagnostic techniques, such as corneal confocal microscopy, are emerging. Recently, small fiber neuropathies have been associated with a broader spectrum of diseases, including fibromyalgia, sodium channel mutations, and voltage-gated potassium channel antibody autoimmune disease.                                         Summary:               Despite advances in diagnosing small fiber neuropathies and sensory neuronopathies, many of these neuropathies remain refractory to treatment. In select cases, early identification and treatment may result in better outcomes. ``Idiopathic'' should be a diagnosis of exclusion and a thorough investigation for treatable causes pursued.},

This article introduces readers to core concepts, as well as recent advances, in bedside and instrumented vestibular assessments. RECENT FINDINGS: Vestibular testing has improved immensely in the past 2 decades. While history and bedside testing is still the primary method of differential diagnosis in patients with dizziness, advances in technology such as the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test for superior canal dehiscence and the video head impulse test for vestibular neuritis have capabilities that go far beyond the bedside examination. Current vestibular testing now allows clinicians to test all five vestibular sensors in the inner ear. SUMMARY: Contemporary vestibular testing technology can now assess the entire vestibular periphery. Relatively subtle conditions, such as superior canal dehiscence or a subtle vestibular neuritis, can now be diagnosed with far greater certainty.},

  abstract = {Background:               Uncompensated vestibular hypofunction can result in symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, and/or oscillopsia, gaze and gait instability, and impaired navigation and spatial orientation; thus, may negatively impact an individual's quality of life, ability to perform activities of daily living, drive, and work. It is estimated that one-third of adults in the United States have vestibular dysfunction and the incidence increases with age. There is strong evidence supporting vestibular physical therapy for reducing symptoms, improving gaze and postural stability, and improving function in individuals with vestibular hypofunction. The purpose of this revised clinical practice guideline is to improve quality of care and outcomes for individuals with acute, subacute, and chronic unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction by providing evidence-based recommendations regarding appropriate exercises.                                         Methods:               These guidelines are a revision of the 2016 guidelines and involved a systematic review of the literature published since 2015 through June 2020 across 6 databases. Article types included meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control series, and case series for human subjects, published in English. Sixty-seven articles were identified as relevant to this clinical practice guideline and critically appraised for level of evidence.                                         Results:               Based on strong evidence, clinicians should offer vestibular rehabilitation to adults with unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction who present with impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions related to the vestibular deficit. Based on strong evidence and a preponderance of harm over benefit, clinicians should not include voluntary saccadic or smooth-pursuit eye movements in isolation (ie, without head movement) to promote gaze stability. Based on moderate to strong evidence, clinicians may offer specific exercise techniques to target identified activity limitations and participation restrictions, including virtual reality or augmented sensory feedback. Based on strong evidence and in consideration of patient preference, clinicians should offer supervised vestibular rehabilitation. Based on moderate to weak evidence, clinicians may prescribe weekly clinic visits plus a home exercise program of gaze stabilization exercises consisting of a minimum of: (1) 3 times per day for a total of at least 12 minutes daily for individuals with acute/subacute unilateral vestibular hypofunction; (2) 3 to 5 times per day for a total of at least 20 minutes daily for 4 to 6 weeks for individuals with chronic unilateral vestibular hypofunction; (3) 3 to 5 times per day for a total of 20 to 40 minutes daily for approximately 5 to 7 weeks for individuals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Based on moderate evidence, clinicians may prescribe static and dynamic balance exercises for a minimum of 20 minutes daily for at least 4 to 6 weeks for individuals with chronic unilateral vestibular hypofunction and, based on expert opinion, for a minimum of 6 to 9 weeks for individuals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Based on moderate evidence, clinicians may use achievement of primary goals, resolution of symptoms, normalized balance and vestibular function, or plateau in progress as reasons for stopping therapy. Based on moderate to strong evidence, clinicians may evaluate factors, including time from onset of symptoms, comorbidities, cognitive function, and use of medication that could modify rehabilitation outcomes.                                         Discussion:               Recent evidence supports the original recommendations from the 2016 guidelines. There is strong evidence that vestibular physical therapy provides a clear and substantial benefit to individuals with unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction.                                         Limitations:               The focus of the guideline was on peripheral vestibular hypofunction; thus, the recommendations of the guideline may not apply to individuals with central vestibular disorders. One criterion for study inclusion was that vestibular hypofunction was determined based on objective vestibular function tests. This guideline may not apply to individuals who report symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, and/or oscillopsia without a diagnosis of vestibular hypofunction.                                         Disclaimer:               These recommendations are intended as a guide to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for individuals undergoing vestibular physical therapy. The contents of this guideline were developed with support from the American Physical Therapy Association and the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy using a rigorous review process. The authors declared no conflict of interest and maintained editorial independence.

Although neuroborreliosis was first identified almost a century ago, much confusion remains about how to accurately diagnose this quite treatable nervous system infection. Well-established diagnostic tools and therapeutic regimens exist for neurosyphilis, which has been well-known for centuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Serologic testing targeting the C6 antigen may simplify diagnostic testing in neuroborreliosis while improving accuracy. Historically, screening for syphilis has used a reaginic test followed by a treponeme-specific assay; alternative approaches, including use of well-defined recombinant antigens, may improve sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. In neuroborreliosis, measurement of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF may provide a useful marker of disease activity in the central nervous system.                                         SUMMARY               Lyme disease causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculitis, and mononeuropathy multiplex. Cognitive symptoms, occurring either during (encephalopathy) or after infection (posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome) are rarely, if ever, due to central nervous system infection. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome is not antibiotic responsive. Syphilis causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, chronic meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, and parenchymal neurosyphilis. The organism remains highly sensitive to penicillin, but residua of chronic infection may be irreversible.},

  abstract = {This article has been corrected. The original version (PDF) is appended to this article as a Supplement. BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence has continuously increased over the past few centuries and represents a major health burden worldwide. PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible causal relationship between intake of red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest from inception until July 2018 and MEDLINE from inception until April 2019 without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies that included more than 1000 adults and reported the association between consumption of unprocessed red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA EXTRACTION: Teams of 2 reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias; 1 reviewer evaluated the certainty of evidence, which was confirmed or revised by the senior reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 118 articles (56 cohorts) with more than 6 million participants, 73 articles were eligible for the dose-response meta-analyses, 30 addressed cancer mortality, and 80 reported cancer incidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that an intake reduction of 3 servings of unprocessed meat per week was associated with a very small reduction in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime. Evidence of low to very low certainty suggested that each intake reduction of 3 servings of processed meat per week was associated with very small decreases in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime; prostate cancer mortality; and incidence of esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancer. LIMITATION: Limited causal inferences due to residual confounding in observational studies, risk of bias due to limitations in diet assessment and adjustment for confounders, recall bias in dietary assessment, and insufficient data for planned subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: The possible absolute effects of red and processed meat consumption on cancer mortality and incidence are very small, and the certainty of evidence is low to very low.

RECENT FINDINGS               The principles underlying spinal cord lesion localization are well established, but improvements in MRI and the discovery of pathologic antibodies associated with causes of transverse myelitis distinct from multiple sclerosis, such as aquaporin-4 IgG and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG, have assisted in diagnosis.                                         SUMMARY               The spinal cord has a highly organized neuroanatomy of ascending and descending tracts that convey sensory, motor, and autonomic information. Using integration of clues from the patient's history and neurologic examination, the effective clinician can distinguish spinal cord from peripheral nerve or brain pathology, often determine the level and parts of the spinal cord affected by a lesion, and focus on a likely diagnosis. The advent of MRI of the spine has revolutionized investigation of spinal cord disorders, but an important place for strong clinical acumen still exists in assessing the patient with a myelopathy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents with motor and nonmotor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, postural instability, and cognitive and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Dance therapy or complex motor activity, besides pharmacological treatment, may have benefits in PD patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of dance in patients with PD. METHODS: We searched for clinical trials in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, and Cochrane till April 2020 using relevant keywords. Data were extracted and pooled as mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) by Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 372 patients were included. Dance showed a significant improvement over the control group in term of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) after three (MD\,= -\,4.49, 95\% CI [-\,6.78,\,-\,2.21], p\,=\,0.00001), six, (MD\,=\,-\,5.96, 95\% CI [-\,8.89,\,-\,3.02], p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), and 12 months (MD\,=\,-\,14.58, 95\% CI [-\,24.76,\,-\,4.4], p\,=\,0.005), and Mini-BES test after 12 months. Compared to exercise, dance showed a significant improvement in Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Mini-BES test. CONCLUSION: In comparison to other types of exercise or no activity, dance improves the symptoms and outcomes in patients with PD, especially motor symptoms. Dance also has positive effects on balance, functional mobility, and cognition.},

Nutrients found in beef are associated with outcomes of wellbeing such as physical and cognitive function, lean body mass, and mood in older adults and individuals with chronic disease. However, it is unclear how beef and nutrients found in beef impact wellbeing in healthy adults {$\geq$}50~years of age. This study systematically reviewed evidence linking the intake of beef and nutrients found in beef to markers of wellbeing in healthy adults. PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched up to August 31, 2021 for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Nutrients included in the analysis were beef, red meat, dietary protein, essential amino acids, branched chain amino acids, tryptophan, arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, zinc, and iron. We identified nine RCTs with results from 55 measurements of markers of wellbeing. An overall positive effect was found of beef and beef's nutrients on wellbeing. There was an overall positive effect of amino acids and protein on wellbeing, with no effect of arginine, vitamin B-12, leucine, and zinc. Physical function was also influenced by beef and nutrients found in beef. Eight of the studies found focused on specific nutrients found in beef, and not beef itself in older adults with one or more chronic diseases. This study identified a need for further research regarding the effect of beef and nutrients found in beef on defined functional outcomes of wellbeing in healthy adults {$\geq$}50~years of age.},

This article reviews various types of inherited myelopathies, with emphasis on hereditary spastic paraplegias and spastic ataxias.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The ever-growing number of myelopathy-causing genes and broadening of phenotype-genotype correlations makes the molecular diagnosis of inherited myelopathies a daunting task. This article emphasizes the main phenotypic clusters among inherited myelopathies that can facilitate the diagnostic process. This article focuses on newly identified genetic causes and the most important identifying clinical features that can aid the diagnosis, including the presence of a characteristic age of onset and additional neurologic signs such as leukodystrophy, thin corpus callosum, or amyotrophy.                                         SUMMARY               The exclusion of potentially treatable causes of myelopathy remains the most important diagnostic step. Syndromic diagnosis can be supported by molecular diagnosis, but the genetic diagnosis at present does not change the management. Moreover, a negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of a hereditary myelopathy because comprehensive molecular testing is not yet available, and many disease-causing genes remain unknown.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In vitro force and deformation measurements formed the basis for determinate, quasistatic analysis of principal forces in the seated lumbar spine. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between seated postures and the mechanical response in component tissues of lumbar intervertebral joints. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the high prevalence of low back pain syndrome, the precise mechanisms relating specific mechanical loads to spinal degeneration are not well understood. Simultaneous, time-dependent measurement of anterior column forces and articular facet forces has not been presented previously. consequently, a determinate analysis of principal component forces has not been possible. METHODS: Twelve lumbar spines (L1-S1) were subjected to constant loading conditions while in flexed and extended seated postures. Time-dependent forces were measured in the anterior column at the L4 and L5 superior endplates and in the four facets of the L3-L4 and L4-L5 motion segments. A quasi-static analysis of sagittal plane forces was used to compute the remaining principal joint forces, including ligament, disc shear, and facet impingement forces. RESULTS: Component forces changed under static loading in both postures. There were significant differences between the mechanical responses of the two postures. Although the vertical creep displacement was greater in the extended seated posture (3.22 mm versus 2.11 mm), the escalation of forces was more severe in the flexed posture. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a mechanism of force balancing in lordotic postures under static loads, whereas flexed postures produce large increases to the tensile forces in the region of the posterior anulus.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with MG can be classified based on antibody status and their clinical presentation; treatment responses may differ based on disease subtypes. Improved diagnostic methods and recognition of new antigenic targets such as lipoprotein-related protein 4 have led to improved diagnostic efficiencies. Corticosteroids remain the first-line immunotherapy, but there is a trend toward minimizing their use at high doses and for long durations. Oral immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and tacrolimus remain useful. An international, multicenter randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcomes in selected patients with nonthymomatous MG. Eculizumab, efgartigimod, and ravulizumab have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor{\textendash}antibody positive. These drugs take advantage of novel mechanisms of action and expand treatment options for patients with MG. Data on rituximab suggest that it can be a good option, especially for patients with MG who are positive for antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). The number of clinical trials and drugs in development for MG is steadily increasing.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis of MG can generally be made from the patient's history, a neurologic examination, and laboratory and electrodiagnostic testing. Carefully selected treatment improves outcomes in MG. Additional treatment options for MG will likely be available in the near future.},

This article reviews these processes and the underlying neuroanatomy and provides an approach to the assessment of prefrontal lobe functions at the bedside.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and behavioral frontal lobe functions are mediated by the prefrontal regions rather than the frontal lobes as a whole. At least five separate prefrontal functions have been defined: energization, task setting, monitoring, behavioral/emotional regulation, and metacognition. Energization is mediated by the superior medial prefrontal cortices bilaterally, task setting by the left lateral frontal cortex, monitoring by the right lateral prefrontal cortex, behavioral/emotional regulation by the orbitofrontal cortex, and metacognition by the frontal poles. Only task setting and monitoring are considered executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Distinct cognitive and behavioral processes are mediated by different parts of the frontal lobe. Lesions in these areas result in characteristic clinical deficits that are discussed in this article. Key messages are that prefrontal regions mediate the higher cortical functions (as opposed to the frontal lobes in general) and that prefrontal functions are not equivalent to executive functions.},

The anatomy and function of the so-called trigeminothalamic tracts have been investigated before. In these animal-based studies from the previous century, the intracerebral pathways were mapped using different retro- and anterograde tracing methods. We review the literature on the trigeminothalamic tracts focusing on these animal tracer studies. Subsequently, we related the observations of these studies to clinical findings using fMRI trials. The intracerebral trigeminal pathways can be subdivided into three pathways: a ventral (contralateral) and dorsal (mainly ipsilateral) trigeminothalamic tract and the intranuclear pathway. Based on the reviewed evidence we hypothesize the co-existence of an ipsilateral nociceptive conduction tract to the cerebral cortex and we translate evidence from animal-based research to the human anatomy. Our hypothesis differs from the classical idea that orofacial pain arises only from nociceptive information via the contralateral, ventral trigeminothalamic pathway. Better understanding of the histology, anatomy and connectivity of the trigeminal fibers could contribute to the discovery of a more effective pain treatment in patients suffering from various orofacial pain syndromes.},

Recent Findings:               Entrapment neuropathies are a common issue in general neurology practice. Early diagnosis and effective management of entrapment mononeuropathies are essential in preserving limb function and maintaining patient quality of life. Median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, radial neuropathy at the spiral groove, and fibular neuropathy at the fibular head are among the most frequently encountered entrapment mononeuropathies. Electrodiagnostic studies and peripheral nerve ultrasound are employed to help confirm the clinical diagnosis of nerve compression or entrapment and to provide precise localization for nerve injury. Peripheral nerve ultrasound demonstrates nerve enlargement at or near sites of compression.                                         Summary:               Entrapment neuropathies are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and effective management require knowledge of peripheral neuroanatomy and recognition of key clinical symptoms and findings. Clinical diagnoses may be confirmed by diagnostic testing with electrodiagnostic studies and peripheral nerve ultrasound.},

  abstract = {Medial epicondyle apophysitis (MEA), also known as little league elbow, is an overuse injury prevalent among adolescent athletes whose sport involves repetitive overhand throwing, racket use, or other overhead arm motions. The medial epicondyle is a bony protrusion on the medial elbow with its own ossification center, separate from the main distal humeral physis, known as an apophysis. This growth center at the medial epicondyle develops around 6-7 years of age and typically fuses by age 15.~The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and the flexor-pronator muscle groups originate at the medial epicondyle and serve to stabilize the elbow against valgus stress.~ Medial epicondyle apophysitis occurs due to excessive and repetitive valgus stress placed on the apophysis before its closure. Over time, the repetitive strain results in a traction-type injury and may cause pathologic widening and inflammation of the apophysis or even an avulsion fracture.~MEA may~cause significant morbidity in young athletes, who must temporarily refrain from their chosen sport until the pain improves and healing occurs. Proper prevention, identification, and prompt treatment of MEA can allow young adolescents to continue in the sports they enjoy without prolonged interruptions in their athletic seasons.},

  abstract = {Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a frequently overlooked peripheral nerve compression or tension event that creates difficulties for the clinician regarding diagnosis and management. Investigators have categorized this condition as vascular versus neurogenic, where vascular TOS can be subcategorized as either arterial or venous and neurogenic TOS can subcategorized as either true or disputed. The thoracic outlet anatomical container presents with several key regional components, each capable of compromising the neurovascular structures coursing within. Bony and soft tissue abnormalities, along with mechanical dysfunctions, may contribute to neurovascular compromise. Diagnosing TOS can be challenging because the symptoms vary greatly amongst patients with the disorder, thus lending to other conditions including a double crush syndrome. A careful history and thorough clinical examination are the most important components in establishing the diagnosis of TOS. Specific clinical tests, whose accuracy has been documented, can be used to support a clinical diagnosis, especially when a cluster of positive tests are witnessed.},

A comprehensive examination process, as described in Part 1 of this review, can reveal the bony and soft tissue abnormalities and mechanical dysfunctions contributing to an individual's TOS symptoms. OBJECTIVE: Part 2 of this review focuses on management of TOS. CONCLUSION: The clinician uses clinical examination results to design a rehabilitation program that focuses on correcting specific problems that were previously identified. Disputed neurogenic TOS is best managed with a trial of conservative therapy before surgical treatment options are considered. Cases that are resistant to conservative treatment may require surgical intervention. True neurogenic TOS may require surgical intervention to relieve compression of the neural structures in the thoracic outlet. Surgical management is required for cases of vascular TOS because of the potentially serious complications that may arise from venous or arterial compromise. Post-operative rehabilitation is recommended after surgical decompression to address factors that could lead to a reoccurrence of the patient's symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background:               Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.                                         Methods:               A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be available and can provide greater benefit.                                         Results:               Strong evidence indicates that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or virtual reality{\textendash}based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual reality{\textendash}based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight{\textendash}supported treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance.                                         Discussion:               The collective findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy.                                         Limitations:               As walking speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of walking training may require substantial physical assistance.                                         Summary:               The guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and subacute stages following injury.                                         Disclaimer:               These recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for persons with chronic stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury to improve walking speed and distance.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of reducing dietary fiber on patients with idiopathic constipation. METHODS: Sixty-three cases of idiopathic constipation presenting between May 2008 and May 2010 were enrolled into the study after colonoscopy excluded an organic cause of the constipation. Patients with previous colon surgery or a medical cause of their constipation were excluded. All patients were given an explanation on the role of fiber in the gastrointestinal tract. They were then asked to go on a no fiber diet for 2 wk. Thereafter, they were asked to reduce the amount of dietary fiber intake to a level that they found acceptable. Dietary fiber intake, symptoms of constipation, difficulty in evacuation of stools, anal bleeding, abdominal bloating or abdominal pain were recorded at 1 and 6 mo. RESULTS: The median age of the patients (16 male, 47 female) was 47 years (range, 20-80 years). At 6 mo, 41 patients remained on a no fiber diet, 16 on a reduced fiber diet, and 6 resumed their high fiber diet for religious or personal reasons. Patients who stopped or reduced dietary fiber had significant improvement in their symptoms while those who continued on a high fiber diet had no change. Of those who stopped fiber completely, the bowel frequency increased from one motion in 3.75 d ({$\pm$} 1.59 d) to one motion in 1.0 d ({$\pm$} 0.0 d) (P {$<$} 0.001); those with reduced fiber intake had increased bowel frequency from a mean of one motion per 4.19 d ({$\pm$} 2.09 d) to one motion per 1.9 d ({$\pm$} 1.21 d) on a reduced fiber diet (P {$<$} 0.001); those who remained on a high fiber diet continued to have a mean of one motion per 6.83 d ({$\pm$} 1.03 d) before and after consultation. For no fiber, reduced fiber and high fiber groups, respectively, symptoms of bloating were present in 0\%, 31.3\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001) and straining to pass stools occurred in 0\%, 43.8\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Idiopathic constipation and its associated symptoms can be effectively reduced by stopping or even lowering the intake of dietary fiber.},

METHOD: We conducted a manual search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, with a search deadline set for February 1, 2023. Data analysis was performed using Stata version 15.0. RESULT: A total of 9 randomized controlled studies were included, involving a total of 316 people, including 159 mesenchymal stem cells and 147 control groups. Results of meta-analysis: Compared to a placebo group, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells resulted in a significant reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores among patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke [SMD=-0.99,95\% CI (-1.93, -0.05)]. Compared to placebo, barthel index [SMD\,=\,0.48,95\% CI (-0.55,1.51)], modified rankin score [SMD\,=\,0.45, 95\% CI (1.11, 0.21)], adverse events (RR\,=\,0.68, 95\% CI (0.40, 1.17)] the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Based on current studies, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can ameliorate neurological deficits in patients with ischemic stroke to a certain extent without increasing adverse reactions. However, there was no significant effect on Barthel index and Modified Rankin score.},

Recent Findings:               Meta-analysis of the trials for endovascular treatment of acute stroke shows no significant increase in hemorrhagic events. Rehabilitation guidelines published by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association in 2016 aid in providing the best clinical practice for patients with stroke, from the time of their initial hospitalization to their return to the community.                                         Summary:               Medical complications from stroke are common and are associated with poor clinical outcomes, increased length of hospital stays and higher rates of readmission, increased cost of care, delayed time to rehabilitation, and increased mortality. Being cognizant of the common complications encountered, taking appropriate measures to prevent them, and knowing how to manage them when they do occur are essential to the continued care of patients with stroke.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Next-generation (exome- and genome-based) sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the identification of single-gene causes of epileptic encephalopathy but have only had a modest impact on patient-specific treatment decisions. The treatment of most forms of epileptic encephalopathy remains a particularly challenging endeavor, with therapeutic decisions chiefly driven by the electroclinical syndrome classification. Most antiseizure drugs are ineffective in the treatment of these disorders, and treatments that are effective often entail significant risk and cost.

The mechanical behaviour of this "new" structure is still poorly understood and hotly debated in current literature. Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is one of the leading causes of lateral knee pain injuries in runners. We currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the healthy behaviour of the ITB, and this is necessary prior to further investigating the aetiology of pathologies like ITBS. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review was to collate the anatomical, biomechanical and clinical literature to understand how the mechanical function of the ITB is influenced by anatomical variation, posture and muscle activation. The complexity of understanding the mechanical function of the ITB is due, in part, to the presence of its two in-series muscles: gluteus maximus (GMAX) and tensor fascia latae (TFL). At present, we lack a fundamental understanding of how GMAX and TFL transmit force through the ITB and what mechanical role the ITB plays for movements like walking or running. While there is a range of proposed ITBS treatment strategies, robust evidence for effective treatments is still lacking. Interventions that directly target the running biomechanics suspected to increase either ITB strain or compression of lateral knee structures may have promise, but clinical randomised controlled trials are still required.},

The main goal of this article is therefore to help integrate mechanics into our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. This article first reviews the key roles that physical forces, extracellular matrix and cell structure play in the control of normal development, as well as in the maintenance of tissue form and function. Recent insights into cellular mechanotransduction--the molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to mechanical stress--also are described. Re-evaluation of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that a wide range of diseases included within virtually all fields of medicine and surgery share a common feature: their etiology or clinical presentation results from abnormal mechanotransduction. This process may be altered by changes in cell mechanics, variations in extracellular matrix structure, or by deregulation of the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical signals and convert them into a chemical or electrical response. Molecules that mediate mechanotransduction, including extracellular matrix molecules, transmembrane integrin receptors, cytoskeletal structures and associated signal transduction components, may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases. Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation also may lead to development of improved medical devices, engineered tissues, and biologically-inspired materials for tissue repair and reconstruction.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The diagnosis and management of hyponatremia continue to evolve. Diagnostic accuracy is improved by assessing serum and urine osmolality as well as urinary sodium. Avoiding overcorrection of hyponatremia is crucial to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome, although even careful correction can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome in patients who have other risk factors. The clinical presentation of osmotic demyelination syndrome has expanded, with many patients presenting with extrapontine myelinolysis in addition to central pontine myelinolysis.                                         SUMMARY               Electrolyte disorders often present with neurologic manifestations. Whereas disorders of some electrolytes, such as sodium, preferentially affect the central nervous system, disorders of others, such as potassium and calcium, have significant neuromuscular manifestations. An understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders and recognition of these manifestations are crucial for the practicing neurologist as the symptoms are reversible with correct management.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The medicinal treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) is mostly symptomatic to relieve pain and incapacity with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), drugs with well-known risks. Complementary medicines might reduce the symptoms of OA and decrease the need for NSAIDs. This study tested the effects of a food supplement, Phytalgic, on pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis and their use of analgesic and NSAIDs. METHODS: A randomized double-blind parallel-groups clinical trial compared Phytalgic (fish-oil, vitamin E, Urtica dioica) to a placebo for three months, in 81 patients with OA of the knee or hip using NSAIDs and/or analgesics regularly. The main outcome measures were use of NSAIDs (in Defined Daily Doses per day - DDD/day) or analgesics (in 500 mg paracetamol-equivalent tablets per week (PET/week) measured each month, and Western Ontario-McMaster University Osteo-Arthritis Index (WOMAC) function scales. RESULTS: After three months of treatment, the mean use of analgesics in the active arm (6.5 PET/week) vs. the placebo arm (16.5) was significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with a group mean difference of -10.0 (95\% CI: -4.9 to -15.1). That of NSAIDs in the active arm (0.4 DDD/day) vs the placebo arm (1.0 DDD/day) was significantly different (P = 0.02) with a group mean difference of - 0.7 DDD/day (95\% CI: -0.2 to -1.2). Mean WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness and function in the active arm (respectively 86.5, 41.4 and 301.6) vs the placebo arm (resp. 235.3, 96.3 and 746.5) were significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with group mean differences respectively of -148.8 (95\% CI: -97.7 to -199.9), -54.9 (95\% CI: -27.9 to -81.9) and -444.8 (95\% CI: -269.1 to -620.4). CONCLUSIONS: The food supplement tested appeared to decrease the need for analgesics and NSAIDs and improve the symptoms of osteoarthritis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00666523.},

Recent work illuminating the complex genetic architecture of AD is discussed in the context of high and low risk and what is known in different populations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                A small proportion of AD is autosomal dominant familial AD caused by variants in                 PSEN1, PSEN2,                 or                 APP                 , although more recently described rare genetic changes can also increase risk substantially over the general population, with odds ratios estimated at 2 to 4.                 APOE                 remains the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, and understanding the biology of                 APOE                 has yielded mechanistic insights and leads for therapeutic interventions. Genome-wide studies enabled by rapidly developing technologic advances in sequencing have identified numerous risk factors that have a low impact on risk but are widely shared throughout the population and involve a repertoire of cell pathways, again shining light on potential paths to intervention. Population studies aimed at defining and stratifying genetic AD risk have been informative, although they are not yet widely applicable clinically because the studies were not performed in people with diverse ancestry and ethnicity and thus population-wide data are lacking.                                                        SUMMARY               The value of genetic information to practitioners in the clinic is distinct from information sought by researchers looking to identify novel therapeutic targets. It is possible to envision a future in which genetic stratification joins other biomarkers to facilitate therapeutic choices and inform prognosis. Genetics already has transformed our understanding of AD pathogenesis and will, no doubt, continue to reveal the complexity of brain biology in health and disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the association between cholesterol level change and mortality is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002-2003 to 2004-2005) change in cholesterol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. Compared to participants who stayed within the 2nd tertile group for cholesterol during both the first and second examinations, participants who became or maintained cholesterol levels to the 1st tertile during the second examination had increased risk of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.28 (1.18-1.38) in 1st/1st, 1.16 (1.07-1.26) in 2nd/1st and 1.47 (1.32-1.64) in 3rd/1st tertile levels, respectively]. In addition, increased or persistent high cholesterol levels to the 3rd tertile was associated with elevated risk for all-cause mortality [aHR (95\% CI) = 1.10 (1.01-1.20) in 1st/2nd, 1.16(1.03-1.31) in 1st/3rd and 1.15(1.05-1.25) in 3rd/3rd tertile levels]. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in cholesterol levels in either direction to low cholesterol or persistently low cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Particularly, spontaneous decline in cholesterol levels may be a marker for worsening health conditions.},

Increased understanding of these pathologic entities is important for the neurologist who may encounter patients with an unusually slowly progressive degenerative dementia that may appear to meet criteria for Alzheimer disease but who progress to develop symptoms that are unusual for classic Alzheimer disease                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Hippocampal sclerosis has traditionally been associated with hypoxic/ischemic injury and poorly controlled epilepsy, but it is now recognized that hippocampal sclerosis may also be associated with a unique degenerative disease of aging or may be an associated pathologic finding in many cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Argyrophilic grain disease has been recognized as an enigma in the field of pathology for over 30 years, but recent discoveries suggest that it may overlap with other tau-related disorders within the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Primary age-related tauopathy has long been recognized as a distinct clinical entity that lies on the Alzheimer pathologic spectrum, with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles that lack the coexistent Alzheimer plaque development; thus, it is thought to represent a distinct pathologic entity.                                         SUMMARY               Despite advances in dementia diagnosis that suggest that we have identified and unlocked the mysteries of the major degenerative disease states responsible for cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly, diseases such as hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease, and primary age-related tauopathy demonstrate that we remain on the frontier of discovery and that our diagnostic repertoire of diseases responsible for such clinical symptoms remains in its infancy. Understanding such diagnostic confounds is important for the neurologist in assigning appropriate diagnoses and selecting appropriate therapeutic management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Chronic pain is maintained in part by central sensitization, a phenomenon of synaptic plasticity, and increased neuronal responsiveness in central pain pathways after painful insults. Accumulating evidence suggests that central sensitization is also driven by neuroinflammation in the peripheral and central nervous system. A characteristic feature of neuroinflammation is the activation of glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, in the spinal cord and brain, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Recent studies suggest that central cytokines and chemokines are powerful neuromodulators and play a sufficient role in inducing hyperalgesia and allodynia after central nervous system administration. Sustained increase of cytokines and chemokines in the central nervous system also promotes chronic widespread pain that affects multiple body sites. Thus, neuroinflammation drives widespread chronic pain via central sensitization. We also discuss sex-dependent glial/immune signaling in chronic pain and new therapeutic approaches that control neuroinflammation for the resolution of chronic pain.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although many different clinical manifestations of dystonia have been recognized for decades, it is only in the past 5 years that a broadly accepted approach has emerged for classifying them into specific subgroups. The new classification system aids clinical recognition and diagnosis by focusing on key clinical features that help distinguish the many subtypes. In the past few years, major advances have been made in the discovery of new genes as well as advances in our understanding of the biological processes involved. These advances have led to major changes in strategies for diagnosis of the inherited dystonias. An emerging trend is to move away from heavy reliance on the phenotype to target diagnostic testing toward a broader approach that involves large gene panels or whole exome sequencing.                                         SUMMARY               The dystonias are a large family of phenotypically and etiologically diverse disorders. The diagnosis of these disorders depends on clinical recognition of characteristic clinical features. Symptomatic treatments are useful for all forms of dystonia and include oral medications, botulinum toxins, and surgical procedures. Determination of etiology is becoming increasingly important because the number of disorders is growing and more specific and sometimes disease-modifying therapies now exist.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW: Referred pain is a common but less understood symptom that originates from somatic tissues. A comprehensive recognition of referred pain is important for clinicians when dealing with it. The purpose of this study is to summarize the current understanding of referred pain, including its pathogenesis, characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Referred pain arises not only from pathologies primarily involving local tissue but also from lesions in distant structures. Central sensitization of convergent neurons and peripheral reflexes of dichotomizing afferent fibers are two theories proposed to explain the pathological mechanism of referred pain. Because syndromes related to referred pain of different origins overlap each other, it is challenging to define referred pain and identify its originating lesions. Although various approaches have been used in the diagnosis and treatment of referred pain, including conservative treatment, blockade, radiofrequency, and surgery, management of referred pain remains a clinical challenge. SUMMARY: Unlike radicular pain and neuropathic pain, referred pain is a less studied area, despite being common in clinics. Referred pain can derive from various spinal structures, and blockage helps identify the primary pathology. Due to the heterogeneity of referred pain, treatment outcomes remain uncertain. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of referred pain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low testosterone (T) levels in men associate with increased risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. However, most studies are cross-sectional with follow-up-time {$<$}10 years, and data on early growth are limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare prenatal factors and body mass index (BMI) development from birth to age 46 in relation to low T at age 31. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Men with low T (T{$<$}12.1nmol/l, n = 132) and men with normal T at age 31 (n = 2561) were derived from the Northern Finland birth cohort 1966. Prenatal factors, longitudinal weight and height data from birth to age 14, and cross-sectional weight and height data at ages 31 and 46, and waist-hip-ratio (WHR) and T levels at age 31 were analysed. Longitudinal modelling and timing of adiposity rebound (AR, second BMI rise at age 5-7 years) were calculated from fitted BMI curves. Results were adjusted for mother's pre-pregnancy BMI and smoking status, birth weight for gestational age, alcohol consumption, education level, smoking status and WHR at age 31. RESULTS: Neither gestational age nor birth weight was associated with low T at age 31, however maternal obesity during gestation was more prevalent among men with low T (9.8\% vs 3.5\%, adjusted aOR: 2.43 (1.19-4.98)). Men with low T had earlier AR (5.28 vs 5.82, aOR: 0.73 (0.56-0.94)) and higher BMI (P{$<$}.001) from AR onwards until age 46. Men with both early AR and low T had the highest BMI from AR onwards. CONCLUSIONS: In men, maternal obesity and early weight gain associate with lower T levels at age 31, independently of adulthood abdominal obesity. Given the well-known health risks related to obesity, and the rising prevalence of maternal obesity, the results of the present study emphasize the importance of preventing obesity that may affect also later reproductive health of the offspring.

This article describes the classification scheme, common subtypes, and the management of individuals with LGMD.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Advances in genetic testing and next-generation sequencing panels containing all of the LGMD genes have led to earlier genetic confirmation, but also to more individuals with variants of uncertain significance. The LGMDs include disorders with autosomal recessive inheritance, which are often due to loss-of-function mutations in muscle structural or repair proteins and typically have younger ages of onset and more rapidly progressive presentations, and those with autosomal dominant inheritance, which can have older ages of presentation and chronic progressive disease courses. All cause progressive disability and potential loss of ability to walk or maintain a job due to progressive muscle wasting. Certain mutations are associated with cardiac or respiratory involvement. No disease-altering therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for LGMDs and standard treatment uses a multidisciplinary clinic model, but recessive LGMDs are potentially amenable to systemic gene replacement therapies, which are already being tested in clinical trials for sarcoglycan and                 FKRP                 mutations. The dominant LGMDs may be amenable to RNA-based therapeutic approaches.

The clinical manifestations of lesions to the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and frontopolar cortex are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Traditional lesion studies have emphasized the role of a brain region in controlling a cognitive function. With advances in neurology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging, the participation of the prefrontal cortex in large-scale networks has been established with recognition that cognitive dysfunction can arise not only from a lesion within a network but also from degenerative disease targeting these large-scale, dynamic neural networks. Although executive dysfunction can result from frontal lobe injury, this article highlights the role of distributed processes subserving executive functions. An atypical phenotype of Alzheimer disease has been described that selectively targets parietal-temporal-frontal networks important for core executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Executive function comprises working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition and depends on top-down (ie, goal-driven) control of distributed processes occurring throughout the brain. The exact behavioral output (ie, function) depends on the content of the processes being controlled. Prefrontal cortex regions serve key cognitive functions related to social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in working memory, goal-driven attention, task switching, planning, problem-solving, and novelty-seeking. The ventral lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in inhibition, response selection, and monitoring; the medial prefrontal cortex in self-knowledge, motivation, emotional regulation, and updating goal-directed behavior; the orbitofrontal cortex in personality, inhibition, and emotional and social reasoning. Although dysexecutive syndromes have been traditionally associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex injury, it is now recognized that they can also result from an impaired parietal-temporal-frontal system, which is targeted in a distinct form of atypical Alzheimer disease. This dysexecutive Alzheimer phenotype is characterized by impaired task performance on a wide battery of neuropsychological tests and simple daily tasks that require executive control. In contrast, dysexecutive syndromes more localized to the frontal lobe involve impaired executive control of social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior.},

Ten adult cadaveric heads were studied, using a magnification ranging from 3{\texttimes} to 40{\texttimes}, after perfusion of the arteries and veins with colored latex. The trigeminal nerve is the largest and most complex of the cranial nerves. It serves as a major conduit of sensory input from the face and provides motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. Because of its size and complexity, it is essential to have thorough knowledge of the nerve before diagnoses and treatment of the pathologic processes in the orofacial, temporomandibular, infratemporal, and pterygopalatine areas. The trigeminal nerve is encountered with imaging or surgery of the skull base surgery.

This article reviews the definition of psychotic symptoms and the evaluation and management of psychosis in primary psychiatric and neurologic disorders frequently seen in neurologic practice.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Emerging evidence supports significant connections between psychosis and structural and functional brain changes in both primary psychotic and neurologic disorders. In addition to antidopaminergic activity, the mechanism of new-generation antipsychotics shifts to act on serotonin receptors, which potentially contributes to their benefits in the treatment of negative symptoms of psychosis and a lesser frequency of extrapyramidal side effects compared with typical antipsychotics. This is also helpful in the treatment of psychosis in patients who have neurodegenerative diseases and are vulnerable to developing extrapyramidal side effects from typical antipsychotics.                                         SUMMARY               Even with significant overlap, management of psychosis in primary psychotic disorders differs from the approach of psychosis in neurologic diseases.

It causes mortality and disability among all group ages, caused by external force, sports-related events or violence and road traffic accidents. In the USA, approximately one-third people die annually due to injury and 1.7 million people suffer from traumatic brain injury. Every year in India around 1.6 million individuals suffer from sustain brain injury with 200,000 deaths and approximately one million person needed recovery treatment at any stage of time. Sports-related head impact and trauma has become an extremely controversial public health and medico-legal problem that accounts for 20\% of all brain injury (including concussion). It is difficult to reverse the primary injury but the secondary injury can be minimized by using proper pharmacological intervention during the initial hours of injury. This article highlights the pathophysiology and types of TBI along with treatment therapies. Till date, there is no single medication that can decrease the progression of the disease so that symptomatic treatment is given to the patient by determining proper pathology. Recently various herbal medicine therapies and traditional supplements have been developed for TBI. Nutritional supplementation and nutraceuticals have exposed potential in the treatment of TBI when used before and after TBI. The compiled data will enable the readers to know the pathophysiology as well as the allopathic and natural remedies to treat the TBI.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Most cryptogenic strokes appear embolic, leading to the term                 embolic stroke of undetermined source                 . It was previously thought that embolic stroke of undetermined source was a single, therapeutically relevant entity, the underlying sources of which would respond to anticoagulant therapy; however, two large randomized trials found no benefit with anticoagulation compared to antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention after embolic stroke of undetermined source. A single antiplatelet drug remains the recommended long-term antithrombotic treatment for secondary stroke prevention in embolic stroke of undetermined source. However, three caveats should be considered with regard to cryptogenic stroke. First, those with minor stroke symptoms presenting early after onset should receive 3 weeks of dual antiplatelet therapy. Second, all patients with cryptogenic stroke should be monitored for atrial fibrillation. Third, patients 60 years of age or younger with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) should be carefully evaluated to determine whether the PFO may have caused the stroke and whether they might benefit from PFO closure.                                                        SUMMARY               More personalized strategies may soon be available to guide treatment of cryptogenic stroke. In the meantime, it is hoped that the application of recent findings from clinical trials will reduce stroke recurrence in this important population.},

Double crush syndrome is a controversial diagnosis; some scientists and surgeons believe it is an illness construction that may do more harm than good because it emphasizes an objective pathophysiologic explanation for unexplained symptoms, disability, and dissatisfaction that may be more psychosocially mediated. However, peripheral neuropathy may coexist with compressive neuropathy and contribute to suboptimal outcomes following nerve decompression. To better manage patients' expectations, treating practitioners should be aware of the possibility of concomitant cervical radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as the presence of underlying systemic neuropathy.},

PURPOSE: To review the diagnostic accuracy of examination tests used in LET. DESIGN: Systematic review following PRISMA-DTA guidelines. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases. The QUADAS-2 checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the eligible studies. We included diagnostic studies reporting the accuracy of physical examination tests or imaging modalities used in patients with LET. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with 1370 participants were identified reporting the diagnostic performance of Ultrasound Imaging (USI) (18 studies), physical examination tests (2 studies) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (4 studies). Most studies (97\%) were assessed with "unclear" or "high risk" of bias. Sonoelastography showed the highest sensitivity (75- 100\%) and specificity (85- 96\%). Grayscale with or without Doppler USI presented poor to excellent values (sensitivity: 53\%-100\%, specificity: 42\%-90\%). MRI performed better in the diagnosis of tendon thickening and enthesopathy (sensitivity and specificity: 81\%-100\%). The Cozen's test reported high sensitivity (91\%) while a grip strength difference of 5\%-10\% between elbow flexion and extension showed high sensitivity (78\%-83\%) and specificity (80\%-90\%). CONCLUSIONS: Cozen's test and grip strength measurement present high accuracy in the diagnosis of LET but are poorly investigated. USI and MRI provide variable diagnostic accuracy depending on the entities reported and should be recommended with caution when differential diagnosis is necessary. Substantial heterogeneity was found in inclusion criteria, operator/ examiner, mode of application, type of equipment and reference standards across the studies.

The mechanism underlying this disorder and its related anatomy have only recently been identified. Investigation of patients with severe pushing behavior has shown that perception of body posture in relation to gravity is altered. The patients experience their body as oriented "upright" when the body actually is tilted to the side of the brain lesion (to the ipsilesional side). In contrast, patients with pusher syndrome show no disturbed processing of visual and vestibular inputs determining visual vertical. These new insights have allowed the authors to suggest a new physical therapy approach for patients with pusher syndrome where the visual control of vertical upright orientation, which is undisturbed in these patients, is the central element of intervention.},

Symptoms can include neck stiffness, yawning, thirst, and increased frequency of micturition. Clinical recognition of these symptoms is important to ensure early and effective attack management. Further understanding of the clinical phenotype and neurobiological mediation of these symptoms is important in the advancement of therapeutics research in both acute and preventive treatments of migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Since 2014, functional imaging studies have been conducted during the premonitory stage of migraine and have provided novel insights into the early neurobiology and anatomy of the earliest stage of the migraine attack. These studies have shown early involvement of subcortical brain areas including the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, dorsal pons, and various limbic cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex during the premonitory phase. More recent work has revealed altered hypothalamic-brainstem functional connectivity during migraine, which starts before the onset of pain. These exciting findings have provided functional correlation of the symptoms experienced by patients and changes seen on functional brain imaging.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600\,000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis. OBSERVATIONS: The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11\% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50\% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10\% to 20\% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95\% CI, 0.8-14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10-12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0-100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0-100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2-4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4\% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9\% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30\% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11\% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Growing evidence indicates that palliative care significantly improves quality of life and symptom burden for people with Parkinson disease and other serious movement disorders, while reducing caregiver burnout. An emphasis on advance care planning guides goal-directed treatment recommendations. Serious illness communication skills are evidence-based methods of relaying bad medical news to patients and mapping out values and goals in a way that provides comfort, emphasizes patient autonomy, and builds coping and resiliency strategies.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a summary of the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with episodic positional dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Positional components are nearly ubiquitous among diagnoses of dizziness, so it can be challenging to classify patients with episodic positional dizziness simply based on the history of present illness. Overreliance on the presence of a report of positional components has likely resulted in misapplication or misinterpretation of positional testing and negative experiences with maneuvers to treat positional dizziness. The prototypical episodic positional dizziness disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by free-floating particles in a semicircular canal that move in response to gravity. The diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic patterns of nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Particle repositioning for BPPV is supported by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. Other disorders that can present with episodic positional dizziness are migraine dizziness, central lesions, and light cupula syndrome. SUMMARY: Episodic positional dizziness is a common presentation of dizziness. Neurologists should prioritize identifying and treating BPPV; doing so provides an important opportunity to deliver effective and efficient care. Providers should also recognize that positional components are common in most causes of dizziness and, therefore, should not over-rely on this part of the history of presentation when considering the diagnosis and management plan.},

  abstract = {Horner syndrome is a rare condition classically presenting with partial ptosis (drooping or falling of upper eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and facial anhidrosis (loss of sweating) due to a disruption in the sympathetic nerve supply. It is primarily acquired following damage to the sympathetic nerve supply, but rare cases of congenital forms have~been seen. Therefore, treatment is centered around identifying and appropriate~management of the underlying secondary cause. The syndrome has several names, such as Bernard-Horner syndrome (French-speaking countries), Horner syndrome (English speaking countries), oculosympathetic palsy, and Von Passow syndrome (Horner syndrome in association with iris heterochromia). The syndrome was first described by Francois Pourfour du Petit in 1727 when considering results from an animal experiment involving resection of intercostal nerves and subsequent changes seen in the ipsilateral eye and face. It was outlined more thoroughly by the French physiologist Claude Bernard in 1852, followed by several physicians who offered different interpretations. The condition was formally described and later named after Swiss ophthalmologist Johann Friedrich Horner in 1869. Anatomy Understanding the sympathetic innervation of the eye is vital to understanding the features of this syndrome. The nerve supply is constituted by three different neurons, starting from the posterolateral hypothalamus and ending as the long ciliary nerves to supply the iris dilator and superior tarsal muscles (Muller muscle). The first-order neurons originate from the hypothalamus and descend through the midbrain and pons uncrossed, terminating at the C8-T2 level of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral cell columns (ciliospinal center of Budge). Second-order preganglionic neurons exit at the T1 level of the spinal cord to enter the cervical sympathetic chain, where the fibers ascend to synapse in the superior cervical ganglion at the C3-C4 level. Third-order, postganglionic fibers branch off into the sudomotor and vasomotor fibers, which follow the external carotid artery and innervate the sweat glands and blood vessels of the face. The remaining fibers ascend along the internal carotid artery in the carotid plexus to eventually enter the cavernous sinus, where they join the abducens nerve (CN VI). The fibers then exit the cavernous sinus to enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure and the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) as the long ciliary nerves.},

Twenty-three guidelines of varying quality (AGREE II overall assessment ranging from 17\% to 92\%) were included. Consistent recommendations regarding diagnosis are ('should do'): Straight leg raise (SLR) test, crossed SLR test, mapping pain distribution, gait assessment, congruence of signs and symptoms. Routine use of imaging is consistently not recommended. The following therapeutic options are consistently recommended ('should do'): educational care, physical activity, discectomy under specific circumstances (e.g., failure of conservative treatment). Referral to a specialist is recommended when conservative therapy fails or when steppage gait is present.

The purpose of this meeting, hosted by the Shoulder Center of Kentucky, was to continue to examine the biomechanical and clinical factors thought to be associated with the role of the scapula in shoulder function and dysfunction. Since the last Summit, much more information has been created in this area, and it was thought that enough progress had been made that an organized overview of current knowledge could provide some consensus statements to guide further research and provide assessment and treatment guidelines. A call for abstracts was extended to researchers with proven interest and published research on the scapula. The meeting was organized around 3 primary categories of information: scapular kinematics and dysfunction, clinical evaluation of the scapula, and interventions. The last session of the meeting involved development of consensus statements for each category. This document represents the current state of knowledge concerning the aspects of scapular function and dysfunction discussed at the Summit. It is expected that, as more knowledge is developed, the gaps will be filled in and a clearer understanding of the roles of the scapula in shoulder function will emerge.

  abstract = {Stress injuries represent a spectrum of injuries ranging from periostitis, caused by inflammation of the periosteum, to a complete stress fracture that includes a full cortical break. They are relatively common overuse injuries in athletes that are caused by repetitive submaximal loading on a bone over time. Stress injuries are often seen in running and jumping athletes and are associated with increased volume or intensity of training workload. Most commonly, they are found in the lower extremities and are specific to the sport in which the athlete participates. Upper extremity stress injuries are much less common than lower extremity stress injuries, but when they do occur, they are most commonly seen in the ulna. Similar to the lower extremity injuries, upper extremity stress injuries are the result of overuse and fatigue. Rib stress fractures are an uncommon site of stress injuries. First rib fractures are the most common, and these are seen in pitchers, basketball players, weightlifters, and ballet dancers. Stress fractures in ribs 4 through 9 are seen in competitive rowers, and posteromedial rib stress fractures can be seen in golfers. Stress fractures of the pelvis can be vague clinically and mimic other causes of groin and hip pain, for example, adductor strain, osteitis pubis, or sacroiliitis. The most common location is the ischiopubic ramus and sacrum. These injuries are seen most commonly in runners. Femoral neck stress fractures make up approximately 11\% of stress injuries in athletes. The patient complains of hip or groin pain which is worse with weight bearing and range of motion especially internal rotation. There are 2 types of femoral neck stress fractures: tension-type (or distraction) fractures and compression-type fractures. Tension-type femoral neck stress fractures involve the superior-lateral aspect of the neck and are at highest risk for complete fracture; thus, these should be detected early. Compression-type fractures are seen in younger athletes and involve the inferior-medial femoral neck. A trial of non-surgical management can be attempted for patients without a visible fracture line on radiographs in compression type injuries. This injury is common in runners. Stress fractures of the femoral shaft are well documented in the literature, and in one study among military recruits, they represented 22.5\% of all stress fractures. Patients typically complain of poorly localized, insidious leg pain often mistaken for muscle injury. An exam is often nonfocal, although the ``fulcrum test'' test can be used by providers to localize the affected pain and suggest the diagnosis. If there is no evidence of a cortical break on imaging, a non-surgical approach can be attempted. The patella is a rare location for a stress fracture and can be oriented either transverse or vertical. Transverse fractures are at higher risk for displacement and immobilization is recommended. Tibial stress injuries are the most common location of stress reactions and fractures. Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), also known as shin splints or tibial periostitis, can be difficult to distinguish from medial tibial stress fractures. Typically, the patient will be tender over the medial posterior edge of the tibia often made worse with a motor exam. Stress injuries will present with pain during activities of daily living, while MTSS is generally limited to exertional activity. Anterior cortex tibial stress fractures are less common than the posteromedial ones and are found in jumping and leaping athletes. These patients may have the ``dreaded black line'' on x-ray. They are at a greater risk of nonunion and full cortical break and require aggressive conservative therapy. If that fails, surgical management such as an intramedullary rod or flexible plate is indicated. Stress fractures of the medial tibial plateau are uncommon but can be confused for meniscus injury or pes anserine bursitis, and thus, a high index of suspicion is needed. Fibular stress fractures are common and most commonly located in the lower third of the fibula, proximal to the tibiofibular ligament. Patients will have reproducible pain on palpation of the affected bone. Medial malleolus stress fractures are uncommon. Running and jumping athletes can develop vertical stress fractures at the junction of the medial malleolus and tibial plafond. If full cortical disruption is identified, surgical fixation is typically indicated. Calcaneal stress fractures present as localized tenderness over the heel of the calcaneus posterior to the talus. Patients will have a positive squeeze test. Stress fractures can develop in the navicular, medial cuneiform, and lateral process of the talus. Navicular stress fractures are difficult to diagnose early on and are at high risk of nonunion due to poor vascular flow, primarily in the middle third. These are common in basketball players and runners. They are usually tender on the navicular bone. Metatarsal stress fractures account for 9\% of all stress fractures in athletes. The second and third metatarsals are most commonly affected and are usually in the neck or distal shaft. They will be point tender with localized swelling over the affected bone. Dancers fracture is a stress fracture at the base of the second metatarsal. Stress fractures distal to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal are termed Jones fractures but must be distinguished from an acute Jones fracture. Sesamoid stress injuries of the great toe present as gradual unilateral plantar pain with the medial (tibial) sesamoid most frequently affected. Direct tenderness or pain with passive extension of the toe aid in diagnosis.},

METHODS: A search of PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases were performed to identify movement, balance, hop/jump, or agility functional performance tests from the current peer-reviewed literature used to assess function of the hip in young, athletic subjects. RESULTS: The single-leg stance, deep squat, single-leg squat, and star excursion balance tests (SEBT) demonstrated evidence of validity and normative data for score interpretation. The single-leg stance test and SEBT have evidence of validity with association to hip abductor function. The deep squat test demonstrated evidence as a functional performance test for evaluating femoroacetabular impingement. Hop/Jump tests and agility tests have no reported evidence of reliability or validity in a population of subjects with hip pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Use of functional performance tests in the assessment of hip dysfunction has not been well established in the current literature. Diminished squat depth and provocation of pain during the single-leg balance test have been associated with patients diagnosed with FAI and gluteal tendinopathy, respectively. The SEBT and single-leg squat tests provided evidence of convergent validity through an analysis of kinematics and muscle function in normal subjects. Reliability of functional performance tests have not been established on patients with hip dysfunction. Further study is needed to establish reliability and validity of functional performance tests that can be used in a young, athletic population with hip dysfunction.

We included randomized controlled trials and adequately adjusted nonrandomized comparative studies of rehabilitation programs reporting performance-based, patient-reported, or healthcare utilization outcomes. Three researchers extracted study data and assessed risk of bias, verified by an independent researcher. Experts in rehabilitation content and complex interventions independently coded rehabilitation interventions. The team assessed strength of evidence. Large heterogeneity across evaluated rehabilitation programs limited conclusions. Evidence from 15 studies suggests that diverse rehabilitation programs may not differ in terms of risk of harm or outcomes of pain, strength, activities of daily living, or quality of life (all low strength of evidence). Evidence is insufficient for other outcomes. In conclusion, no differences in outcomes were found between different rehabilitation programs after THA. Further evidence is needed to inform decisions on what attributes of rehabilitation programs are most effective for various outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Among its prominent functions, one can mention control of neuronal and glial development, neuroprotection, and modulation of both short- and long-lasting synaptic interactions, which are critical for cognition and memory. A wide spectrum of processes are controlled by BDNF, and the sometimes contradictory effects of its action can be explained based on its specific pattern of synthesis, comprising several intermediate biologically active isoforms that bind to different types of receptor, triggering several signaling pathways. The functions of BDNF must be discussed in close relation to the stage of brain development, the different cellular components of nervous tissue, as well as the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction activated under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of BDNF on regulation of neurophysiological processes. The importance of BDNF for future studies aimed at disclosing mechanisms of activation of signaling pathways, neuro- and gliogenesis, as well as synaptic plasticity is highlighted.},

PURPOSE: This review aims to concisely present the literature on LT tendinopathy and tears in order to guide health care professionals in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the diagnosis and surgical management of ligamentum teres tendinopathy and tears. CONCLUSIONS: The ligamentum teres is an important stabilizer to the hip joint, particularly with hip flexion and external rotation. Older age and acetabular bony pathomorphology are two of the known risk factors for LT tears. Symptoms of LT tendinopathy are largely non-specific, mimicking a wide range of other hip disorders including impingement and instability. Debridement of LT tears or reactive tissue has been reported with good outcomes, with more recent studies describing reconstruction of a completely torn, nonfunctional, or absent LT using various graft sources including synthetic grafts, autografts, and allografts.

In addition to the bone, joint, and soft tissue injuries incurred in sports, physical therapists are seeing more and more traumas associated with aging and with high-speed accidents. This great variety of injury types increases the complexity of treatment. Moreover, in recent years there has been a growing demand for the most complete restoration possible of both physical and psychological function. This is the principal objective of aftercare. Accordingly, this book focuses on a comprehensive presentation of individual injuries and their effect on function, as well as the guidelines and potential results of physical therapy treatment. It is addressed to students, practitioners, and teachers of physical therapy who must master and apply an understanding of the whole range of injuries, their consequences, and their treatment.

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS: The term sensorimotor describes all the afferent, efferent, and central integration and processing components involved in maintaining stability in the postural control system through intrinsic motor-control properties. The scope of this paper is to highlight the sensorimotor deficits that can arise from altered cervical afferent input. From a clinical orthopaedic perspective, the peripheral mechanoreceptors are the most important in functional joint stability; but in the cervical region they are also important for postural stability, as well as head and eye movement control. Consequently, conventional musculoskeletal intervention approaches may be sufficient only for patients with neck pain and minimal sensorimotor proprioceptive disturbances. Clinical experience and research indicates that significant sensorimotor cervical proprioceptive disturbances might be an important factor in the maintenance, recurrence, or progression of various symptoms in some patients with neck pain. In these cases, more specific and novel treatment methods are needed which progressively address neck position and movement sense, as well as cervicogenic oculomotor disturbances, postural stability, and cervicogenic dizziness. In this commentary we review the most relevant theoretical and practical knowledge on this matter and implications for clinical assessment and management, and we propose future directions for research.

  abstract = {Agnosia is a rare disorder whereby a patient is unable to recognize and identify objects, persons, or sounds using one or more of their senses despite otherwise normally functioning senses. The deficit cannot be explained by memory, attention, language problems, or unfamiliarity with the stimuli. Usually, one of the sensory modalities is affected. For example, a patient with agnosia may not be able to~identify a cup by sight, although they may be able to~tell its color and identify it by touch by its shape and texture. It is not the same as anomia. Anomia is a naming disorder in which patients cannot name an object despite using their other sensory modalities like touch and smell.~ Classically, there are 2 forms of agnosia: apperceptive and associative. Apperceptive agnosia is a failure in recognition due to deficits in the early stages of perceptual processing. Associative agnosia is a failure in recognition despite no deficit in perception. Associative agnosia patients can typically draw, match or copy objects while apperceptive agnosia patients cannot. Types of Agnosia There are 3 main types of agnosia, based on the type of~sensation involved. 1. Visual (vision). 2. Auditory (hearing). 3. Tactile (touch). Visual Agnosia~ Visual agnosia refers to an impairment in recognizing visually presented objects, despite otherwise normal visual field, acuity, color vision, brightness discrimination, language, and memory. Patients can recognize objects using other sensory~modalities. Sometimes impairment is worse for certain types of objects, so a variety of objects should be tested to diagnose precisely. Visual agnosia is the most common and better-understood agnosia. Agnosia~is further divided into 2 subtypes: apperceptive visual agnosia and associative visual agnosia. Apperceptive visual agnosia refers to an abnormality in visual perception and discriminative process, despite the absence of elementary visual deficits. These people are unable to recognize objects, draw, or copy a figure. They cannot perceive correct forms of the object, although knowledge of the object is intact. Apperceptive visual agnosia is typically associated with lesions to the parietal, occipital cortex. Associative visual agnosia refers to difficulty with understanding the meaning of what they are seeing. They can draw or copy but do not know what they have drawn. They correctly perceive the form and know the object when tested with verbal or tactile information, but cannot identify the object. They are unable to link the fully perceived visual stimulus to prior experience to help them recognize the stimulus. Associative visual agnosia is usually associated with damage to the bilateral inferior occipitotemporal cortex. Types of Visual Agnosia:  Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize familiar faces. Patients can often identify other aspects like gender, hair, emotions. Prosopagnosia results from damage to the fusiform face area (located~in the inferior temporal cortex in the fusiform gyrus). People with apperceptive prosopagnosia cannot perceive facial expressions and cues but can recognize non-facial clues like hair and clothing. Associative prosopagnosia patients can derive some~facial information like gender and age. Mr. P~in Oliver Sack's book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat~presents a classic~case of prosopagnosia. Simultanagnosia~is the inability to recognize and sort out objects when they appear together, but they can recognize them when they appear alone. Patients are unable to perceive the overall meaning of a picture or multiple things together, although they can describe isolated elements. Two forms of simultagnosia have been described. 1. Dorsal simultagnosia: Patients cannot see more than one object at a time. For example, when presented with a~picture with a table, chair, and flower vase, they may report only one thing at a time. When their attention is diverted to the other~thing, they can then identify only that thing; other things disappear to them. They often have difficulty reading as it involves viewing more than one word at a time. They often bump into objects that are close together. Dorsal simultagnosia is typically associated with lesions in the bilateral occipitotemporal cortex. 2. Ventral simultagnosia:~These individuals also cannot identify more than one object or complex objects at one time, although they can see more than one object at a time. They are unable to perceive the whole picture as one and derive a meaning out of it. For example, in a night sky picture with stars and a full moon, they may identify the moon as a ball, unable to derive the meaning of the whole picture.~Ventral simultagnosia is associated with lesions in the left inferior occipital area. Color agnosia is the inability to identify and distinguish colors, despite intact basic color vision and brightness discrimination mechanisms. It is very difficult to diagnose this type of~agnosia as colors can only be appreciated visually. Usually, these patients have a lesion in the left occipitotemporal region of the brain. Topographical agnosia~is the inability to orient to surroundings because~of the inability~to interpret spatial information. These patients have a good memory of the layout and specifics of the places well known to them, but they are unable to navigate their way through. They are unable to use visual cues to guide them in the right direction. Associated with a lesion in the right posterior cingulate area of the brain. Finger agnosia~is a difficulty in naming and differentiating among the fingers of either hand as well the hand of others. It does not refer to the inability to identify a finger as a finger, as the name may suggest. It is a part of the constellation of symptoms often referred to as Gerstmann syndrome which includes acalculia, agraphia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation. Akinetopsia refers to the inability to perceive motion. Agnostic alexia~refers to the inability to recognize words visually. They can still write and talk without difficulty.  Auditory Agnosia:   Auditory agnosia is an inability to recognize sounds despite intact hearing. Auditory agnosias are typically associated with right side temporal lesions. Types of Auditory Agnosia:  Phonagnosia is the inability to recognize familiar voices. They can recognize words spoken by others.~It is caused by damage to certain parts of the sound association region. Verbal auditory agnosia or pure word deafness is the inability to comprehend spoken words but can read, write, and speak in a relatively normal manner. Nonverbal auditory agnosia is the inability to comprehend nonverbal sounds and noises, with sparing of speech comprehension. Amusia is the inability to recognize the music. They are unable to comprehend that certain types of sounds represent music and therefore cannot distinguish music from other sounds.  Tactile Agnosia  Tactile agnosia refers to the inability to recognize objects by touch. They can name objects by sight. Amorphognosia is the inability to identify the size and shape of objects by touch, for example, a triangle or square. Ahylognosia is the inability to identify distinctive qualities like texture and weight, for example, a piece of wood, cotton, or metal. Tactile asymbolia~is impaired recognition by touch in the absence of amorphognosia and ahylognosia. .},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of novel genetic causes for ataxia and a more comprehensive understanding of the biological pathways critical for normal cerebellar function. When these molecular pathways become dysfunctional, patients develop cerebellar ataxia. In addition, several ongoing clinical trials for Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia will likely result in novel symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies for ataxia. Antisense oligonucleotides for spinocerebellar ataxias associated with CAG repeat expansions might be a promising therapeutic strategy.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebellar ataxias include heterogeneous disorders affecting cerebellar function, leading to ataxic symptoms. Step-by-step diagnostic workups with genetic investigations are likely to reveal the underlying causes of ataxia. Some disease-specific therapies for ataxia exist, such as vitamin E for ataxia with vitamin E deficiency and thiamine for Wernicke encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of recognizing these forms of ataxia. Finally, genetic diagnosis for patients with ataxia will accelerate clinical trials for disease-modifying therapy and will have prognostic value and implications for family planning for these patients.},

The muscle, passing distally throughout the length of the lower leg, consists of a small muscle belly and a long, thin tendon. It originates, traditionally, on the popliteal surface of the femur and the knee joint capsule, and then inserts to the calcaneal tuberosity. It has been suggested that mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy may be caused by certain plantaris tendon morphologies. This case report describes a new anomalous plantaris tendon insertion, closely related to the Achilles tendon. It comprise four distinct insertions and one direct merge with the calcaneal tendon.

The limitations of these tests are also discussed, as they only screen for a subset of the many inborn errors of metabolism that exist.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in next-generation sequencing and the emerging use of advanced metabolomic screening have made it possible to diagnose treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are not included in current newborn screening programs. Some of these inborn errors of metabolism are especially likely to present with nonspecific neurologic phenotypes, such as epilepsy, ataxia, or intellectual disability. However, cost may be a barrier to obtaining these newer tests. It is important to keep in mind that common metabolic testing may lead to treatable diagnoses. Resources are available to guide neurologists in diagnosing genetic metabolic conditions.                                         SUMMARY               This article introduces the clinical presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are important for neurologists to consider in patients of all ages. Inborn errors of metabolism are rare, but they can present with neurologic symptoms. Newborns are now screened for many treatable metabolic disorders, but these screening tests may miss milder presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that present later in life. These patients may present to adult neurologists who may be less likely to consider metabolic genetic testing.},

The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the clinical and functional outcomes following mesenchymal stem cell application focusing on early to moderate knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: A systematic search was done using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. All Studies published between 2017 and March 2023 on patients treated with single mesenchymal stem cell injection for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis reported on clinical and functional outcomes were included. RESULTS: Twelve articles comprising 539 patients and 576 knees treated with a single intraarticular injection of MSCs for knee osteoarthritis were included in the current systematic review. In eligible studies, the reported outcomes were improved concerning patient-reported outcomes measures, knee function, pain relief, and quality of patient's life. CONCLUSION: Based on high-level evidence studies, single intraarticular injection of MSCs is a safe, reliable, and effective treatment option for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis. However, the lack of homogeneity in the included studies and the variance in MSCs sources and preparations should be noted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis and subsequent total hip arthroplasty (THA) lead to damages to hip joint mechanoceptors, which in turns lead to impairments in proprioception. One of the abilities mainly affected by an altered joint proprioception is balance. The aim of this work was to investigate the balance and proprioception impairments, current assessment tools, and rehabilitation training after THA. METHODS: A systematic literature revision was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Articles reporting balance and proprioception impairments, current assessment tools, or rehabilitation interventions were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. A total of 41 articles were included, 33 discussing balance and proprioception assessment, and 8 dealing with training. Data related to type of surgical approach, type and timing of assessment protocols, assessment instrumentation, and type, volume and duration of the rehabilitation training were extracted from each study. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were of high quality, 2 of moderate quality and 8 of low-quality. Literature review showed an improvement in balance following THA in comparison with the pre-operative performance, although balance abnormalities persist up to 5\,years after surgery, with THA patients showing an increased risk for falls. Balance training is effective in all the rehabilitation phases if specifically structured for balance enhancement and consistent in training volume. It remains unclear which assessments are more appropriate for the different rehabilitation phases, and if differences exist between the different surgical procedures used for THA. Only two studies assessed proprioception. CONCLUSION: Balance and proprioception show impairments up to 5\,years after THA, increasing the risk of falls. However, patients with THA may benefit of an adequate balance training. Further research is needed to investigate the gaps in balance and proprioception assessment and training following THA surgery.},

  abstract = {Aphasia is an impairment of comprehension or formulation of language caused by damage to the cortical center for language. It can be caused by many different brain diseases and disorders; however, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the most common reason for a person to develop aphasia. The symptoms of aphasia can range from mild impairment to complete loss of any fundamental components of language such as semantic, grammar, phonology, morphology, and syntax. The function of language is the ability to express and comprehend spoken and written words. The language area of the brain is typically located in the dominant hemisphere. These structures include Wernicke area, Broca area, and arcuate fasciculus.~The Wernicke area is located at the posterior end of the superior temporal gyrus. Its function is to process visual and auditory information, and it is the center for comprehension and planning of words. Broca area is located in the inferior frontal area and is the center for motor execution of speech and sentence formation.~Arcuate fasciculus is the neural pathway connecting Wernicke area to the Broca area.~ Specific aphasia syndromes are dependent on the location of the lesion in the brain.~In fluent aphasia, the patient can speak in sentences that sound like normal speech, but some of the words are made-up words or have some sounds that are not correct. ~People with non-fluent aphasia struggle to get words out, omit words, and speak in very short sentences. Specific non-fluent aphasia syndromes include Broca, transcortical motor, mixed transcortical, and global. Fluent aphasia syndromes include Wernicke, transcortical sensory, conduction, and anomic.},

Although these complications can be seen in patients without cancer as well, the purpose of this review is to highlight how the presentation, etiology, and management of delirium, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, and central nervous system infections may be different in patients with cancer.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Some of the newer anticancer therapies are associated with neurologic complications. Delirium and seizures have been described in patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and other immune effector cell therapies. Angiogenesis inhibitors can increase the risk of bleeding and clotting, including intracranial hemorrhage and stroke. The risk of opportunistic fungal infections, including aspergillosis, is elevated with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib.                                         SUMMARY               Providers should familiarize themselves with neurologic complications in patients with cancer because early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes. The differential diagnosis should be broad, including conventional causes as seen in patients who do not have cancer, with special consideration of etiologies specific to patients with cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To collect the available evidence about the effectiveness of pain neuroscience education (PNE) on pain, disability, and psychosocial factors in patients with chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and central sensitization (CS). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Searches were performed on Pubmed, PEDro, and CINAHL, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients {$\geq$}18 years of age with chronic MSK pain due to CS were included. No meta-analysis was conducted, and qualitative analysis was realized. RESULTS: 15 RCTs were included. Findings were divided for diagnostic criteria (fibromyalgia-FM, chronic fatigue syndrome-CFS, low back pain-LBP, chronic spinal pain-CSP). PNE has been proposed as a single intervention or associated with other approaches, and different measures were used for the main outcomes considered. Conclusions, practice implication: PNE is effective in improving pain, disability, and psychosocial factors in patients with fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain (CLBP)-especially if associated with other therapeutic approaches-and also in patients with CFS and CSP. Overall, PNE seems to be more effective when proposed in one-to-one oral sessions and associated with reinforcement elements. However, specific eligibility criteria for chronic MSK pain due to CS are still lacking in most RCTs; therefore, for future research, it is mandatory to specify such criteria in primary studies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although death determination should be consistent among physicians and across hospitals, states, and countries to ensure that someone who is declared dead in one place would not be considered alive elsewhere, variability exists in the prerequisites, clinical evaluation, apnea testing, and use of ancillary testing to evaluate for BD/DNC. Confusion also exists about performance of an evaluation for BD/DNC in challenging clinical scenarios, such as for a patient who is on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a patient who was treated with therapeutic hypothermia. This prompted the creation of the World Brain Death Project, which published an international consensus statement on BD/DNC that has been endorsed by five world federations and 27 medical societies from across the globe.                                         SUMMARY               The World Brain Death Project consensus statement is intended to provide guidance for professional societies and countries to revise or develop their own protocols on BD/DNC, taking into consideration local laws, culture, and resource availability; however, it does not replace local medical standards. To that end, pending publication of an updated guideline on determination of BD/DNC across the lifespan, the currently accepted medical standards for BD/DNC in the United States are the 2010 American Academy of Neurology standard for determination of BD/DNC in adults and the 2011 Society of Critical Care Medicine/American Academy of Pediatrics/Child Neurology Society standard for determination of BD/DNC in infants and children.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), thrombosis of the dural sinus, cerebral veins, or both, is a rare cerebrovascular disease. Although mortality rates after CVT have declined over time, this condition can result in devastating neurologic outcomes. This article reviews the latest literature regarding CVT epidemiology, details new factors associated with the development of CVT, and describes advances in CVT treatment. It also contains a discussion of future directions in the field, including novel diagnostic imaging modalities, and potential strategies to reduce the risks associated with CVT.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The incidence of CVT may be as high as 2 per 100,000 adults per year. It remains a difficult condition to diagnose given its variable clinical manifestations and the necessity of neuroimaging for confirmation. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a novel CVT trigger, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), as well as an association between COVID-19 infection and CVT. Although VITT is a very rare event, timely diagnosis and treatment of CVT due to VITT likely improves patient outcomes. Direct oral anticoagulants are currently being used to treat CVT and emerging data suggest that these agents are as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists. The role of endovascular therapy to treat CVT, despite a recent clinical trial, remains unproven.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The incidence of CVT has increased, outcomes have improved, and the use of direct oral anticoagulants to treat CVT represents an important advance in the clinical care of these patients. Rates of CVT as a complication of COVID-19 vaccines using adenoviral vectors are very low ({$<$}5 per million vaccine doses administered), with the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination far outweighing the risks.},

A partly revised and simplified theory of the single-score ICC is obtained, together with an alternative and simple recipe for its use in reliability studies. Our main, practical conclusion is that in the analysis of a reliability study it is neither necessary nor convenient to start from an initial choice of a specified statistical model. Rather, one may impartially use all three single-score ICC formulas. A near equality of the three ICC values indicates the absence of bias (systematic error), in which case the classical (one-way random) ICC may be used. A consistency ICC larger than absolute agreement ICC indicates the presence of non-negligible bias; if so, classical ICC is invalid and misleading. An F-test may be used to confirm whether biases are present. From the resulting model (without or with bias) variances and confidence intervals may then be calculated. In presence of bias, both absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC should be reported, since they give different and complementary information about the reliability of the method. A clinical example with data from the literature is given.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) is a non-invasive and inexpensive therapy used to treat Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) by sequentially activating motor networks in such a way that movement and pain are unpaired. The objective of this systematic review was to critically appraise relevant data on the efficacy of GMI and its components for reducing PLP and disability in amputees. METHODS: We searched 11 electronic databases for controlled trials investigating GMI and its components in amputees with PLP from inception until February 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted relevant data. Study-level data were entered using the inverse variance function of the Review Manager 5 and pooled with the random effects model. RESULTS: Eleven studies with varying risk of bias were eligible. No eligible study considered left/right judgement tasks in isolation. Studies showed no effect for imagined movements, but positive effects were seen for GMI [weighted mean difference: -21.29 (95\%CI: -31.55, -11.02), I2= 0\%] and mirror therapy [weighted mean difference: -8.55 (95\%CI: -14.74, -2.35, I2= 61\%]. A comparison of mirror therapy versus sham showed no difference [weighted mean difference: -4.43 (95\%CI: -16.03, 7.16), I2= 51\%]. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that GMI and mirror therapy may be effective for reducing PLP. However, this conclusion was drawn from a limited body of evidence, and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Therefore, rigorous, high-quality trials are needed to address the gap in the literature and inform practice.},

Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) effectively improved and maintained the range of motion; however, it is not clear whether it can improve the shoulder joint structure in patients with frozen shoulder. This pilot study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) observation to assess the improvement of the local structure of the shoulder joint upon PNF treatment to elucidate a target based on structure for the treatment of frozen shoulder.                                         Materials and methods               Forty-eight patients with frozen shoulder were randomly divided into the traditional manual therapy group and the PNF technique group. Changes in the thicknesses of the coracohumeral ligament (CHL) and capsule in axillary recess (CAR) of the shoulder joint were observed via MRI upon admission and at 4 weeks after treatment. A visual analog scale (VAS) and passive shoulder range of motion (ROM) at abduction, anteflexion and external rotation position were used to evaluate the improvement of shoulder joint pain and function in the initial, mid-term, and discharge of the two groups of patients.                                         Results                                The primary outcome results shown that the PNF joint mobilization significantly reduced the thickness of the CHL (                 p                 \,=\,0.0217) and CAR (                 p                 \,=\,0.0133). Compared with simple joint mobilization, The mid-term and discharge rehabilitation assessment results showed that PNF has a better effect on shoulder pain. At the mid-term evaluation, the ROM of the PNF group was significantly better than that of the Control group in the three directions (                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.05).

It also provides a brief introduction to the concept of the glymphatic system and select cellular contributors to cerebral edema.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral edema and brain compression should be treated in a tiered approach after the patient demonstrates a symptomatic indication to start treatment. All patients with acute brain injury should be treated with standard measures to optimize intracranial compliance and minimize risk of ICP elevation. When ICP monitors are used, therapies should target maintaining ICP at 22 mm Hg or less. Evidence exists that serial clinical examination and neuroimaging may be a reasonable alternative to ICP monitoring; however, clinical trials in progress may demonstrate advantages to advanced monitoring techniques. Early decompressive craniectomy and hypothermia are not neuroprotective in traumatic brain injury and should be reserved for situations refractory to initial medical interventions. Medical therapies that acutely lower plasma osmolality may lead to neurologic deterioration from osmotic cerebral edema, and patients with acute brain injury and renal or liver failure are at elevated risk.                                         SUMMARY               A tiered approach to the management of cerebral edema and brain compression can reduce secondary brain injury when implemented according to core physiologic principles. However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute brain injury is incomplete, and the conceptual framework underlying decades of clinical management may need to be revised in response to currently evolving discoveries regarding the pathophysiology of acute brain injury.},

Recent Findings:               The risk for recurrence and mortality appear to be low for neonatal and childhood stroke. Most children have relatively mild deficits, but those who have greater neurologic deficits, poststroke epilepsy, or strokes early in life are at risk for lower overall cognitive function. Stroke recurrence and long-term mortality after stroke in young adults are greater than originally thought. Cognitive impairments, depression, and anxiety are associated with higher levels of poststroke unemployment and represent targets for improved poststroke care. Poststroke care in young adults involves more than medical management. Self-reported memory and executive function impairments may be more severe than what is detected by objective measures. Assessment of possible cognitive impairments and appropriate management of psychological comorbidities are key to maximizing the long-term functional outcome of stroke survivors.                                         Summary:               Childhood and young adult stroke survivors survive for many more years than older patients with stroke. To ensure that these survivors maximize the productivity of their lives, neurologists must not only optimize medical management but also recognize that impairments in cognition and mood may be remediable barriers to long-term functional independence.},

  abstract = {Mechanical loading to the knee joint results in a differential response based on the local capacity of the tissues (ligament, tendon, meniscus, cartilage, and bone) and how those tissues subsequently adapt to that load at the molecular and cellular level. Participation in cutting, pivoting, and jumping sports predisposes the knee to the risk of injury. In this narrative review, we describe different mechanisms of loading that can result in excessive loads to the knee, leading to ligamentous, musculotendinous, meniscal, and chondral injuries or maladaptations. Following injury (or surgery) to structures around the knee, the primary goal of rehabilitation is to maximize the patient's response to exercise at the current level of function, while minimizing the risk of re-injury to the healing tissue. Clinicians should have a clear understanding of the specific injured tissue(s), and rehabilitation should be driven by knowledge of tissue-healing constraints, knee complex and lower extremity biomechanics, neuromuscular physiology, task-specific activities involving weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions, and training principles. We provide a practical application for prescribing loading progressions of exercises, functional activities, and mobility tasks based on their mechanical load profile to knee-specific structures during the rehabilitation process. Various loading interventions can be used by clinicians to produce physical stress to address body function, physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. By modifying the mechanical load elements, clinicians can alter the tissue adaptations, facilitate motor learning, and resolve corresponding physical impairments. Providing different loads that create variable tensile, compressive, and shear deformation on the tissue through mechanotransduction and specificity can promote the appropriate stress adaptations to increase tissue capacity and injury tolerance. Tools for monitoring rehabilitation training loads to the knee are proposed to assess the reactivity of the knee joint to mechanical loading to monitor excessive mechanical loads and facilitate optimal rehabilitation.},

MOG-associated disorders can easily be confused with other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica, but they have a distinct clinical phenotype and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Most patients with MOG-associated disorders exhibit optic neuritis, myelitis, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) alone, sequentially, or in combination; the disease may be either monophasic or relapsing. Recent case reports have continued to expand the clinical spectrum of disease, and increasingly larger cohort studies have helped clarify its pathophysiology and natural history.                                         SUMMARY               Anti{\textendash}MOG-associated disorders comprise a substantial subset of patients previously thought to have other seronegative CNS diseases. Accurate diagnosis is important because the relapse patterns and prognosis for MOG-associated disorders are unique. Immunotherapy appears to successfully mitigate the disease, although not all agents are equally effective. The emerging large-scale data describing the clinical spectrum and natural history of MOG-associated disorders will be foundational for future therapeutic trials.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The imaging characterization of immune-mediated myelopathies and the discovery of neural autoantibodies have been crucial in improving our ability to accurately diagnose myelitis. The identification of autoantibodies directed against specific central nervous system targets has led to major improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation in myelitis. It has also allowed distinction of these myelopathy etiologies from noninflammatory etiologies of myelopathy and from multiple sclerosis and provided insight into their risk of recurrence, treatment response, and long-term clinical outcomes. Prompt recognition and appropriate testing in the setting of acute and subacute myelopathies is critical as timely administration of immunotherapy can help improve symptoms and prevent permanent neurologic disability. A patient should not be classified as having ``idiopathic transverse myelitis'' without a comprehensive evaluation for a more specific etiology. Achieving the correct diagnosis and learning to recognize noninflammatory myelitis mimics is crucial as they have therapeutic and prognostic implications.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative rehabilitation is an important component of recovery after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR), facilitating successful return to sport (RTS) by reducing risk factors for repeat injury. PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to determine the best protocol for RTS after ACLR in children. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases were searched from October 3, 2014, to November 3, 2022. The inclusion criteria were the pediatric population ({$<$}18 years old) after ACLR with clear RTS criteria and/or mean/median time to RTS. Multiligament knee injuries were excluded from this study. The methodologic quality of the included articles was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS). The highest possible score was 24 points for comparative studies (ie, a study comparing 2 protocols or more). Noncomparative studies or studies with a single protocol could score a maximum of 16 points as assessed by the MINORS score. RESULTS: The search yielded 1816 titles, and 24 were retained based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Every study was published between 2015 and 2022. Among the 24 studies included, 13 were retrospective and 11 were prospective. The mean MINORS score for the noncomparative studies was 13 of 16 (n = 23) and 23 of 24 for the comparative study (n = 1). The studies were categorized into unspecified clearance (n = 10), milestone based (n = 13), and combined time and milestone (n = 1). A total of 1978 patients (57\% female) were included in the review. The mean age at ACLR was 14.7 years. The most common endpoint used was graft rupture (0\% to 35\%). In the unspecified group, the quickest RTS was 5.8 months and the longest was 9.6 months. Statistically significant risk factors for ACL reinjury included younger age and earlier RTS. The latter was a significant contributor to graft failure for combined time-based and milestone-based RTS. In the milestone-based group, the most common criteria were {$\geq$}90\% limb symmetry measured using hamstring strength, quadriceps strength, and/or hop tests. The mean RTS time was 6.8 to 13.5 months. CONCLUSION: RTS should be delayed, when possible, especially in the younger population. A combination of quantitative tests and qualitative tests is also recommended. However, optimal RTS criteria have yet to be determined. Future prospective studies should focus on comparing the different times and milestones currently available.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The diagnosis of disorders of the cauda equina continues to be a challenge. If a compressive etiology is seen, urgent neurosurgical intervention is recommended. However, many people with clinical features of cauda equina dysfunction will have negative diagnostic studies.

Consequently, the diagnosis of tremor disorders can be challenging, and misdiagnoses are common. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with straightforward approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of tremors.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Focused ultrasound thalamotomy of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is an emerging and promising therapy for the treatment of essential tremor.                                         SUMMARY               The evaluation should start with a detailed tremor history followed by a focused neurologic examination, which should attend to the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, the history and examination are used to establish whether the primary tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intention tremor) or a resting tremor. The clinician should then formulate two sets of diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which resting tremor is the predominant tremor. Among the most common of the former type are essential tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, primary writing tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Parkinson disease is the most common disorder of resting tremor. This article details the clinical features of each of these disorders, as well as those of additional tremor disorders.},

Research studies, however, by virtue of their design, are very controlled environments and, therefore, in contrast to the ever-increasing evidence for PNE, little is known about the clinical application of this emerging therapy.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. OBJECTIVES: To determine the reliability of a surface sensor measurement of clavicular motion during arm elevation and to describe 3-dimensional clavicular motion in an asymptomatic population. BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular motion on the thorax has been implicated in shoulder pathology. Without the ability to measure clavicular motion, it is not possible to identify if abnormal scapular motions derive from the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty-nine subjects participated in the investigation, including an asymptomatic group (n = 30) and a group with a history or current symptoms of shoulder pathology (n = 9). Clavicular angles relative to the thorax were tracked with surface electromagnetic sensors on the thorax, clavicle, and humerus as subjects completed humeral flexion, scapular plane abduction, and abduction. Within-day reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients and SEM. Descriptive statistics quantified sternoclavicular joint motions for the various arm movements. RESULTS: Reliable measurements were obtained, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.93 to 0.99, and SEMs from 0.9 degrees to 1.8 degrees. Between-day reliability SEM values were generally 2 degrees to 4 degrees. During elevation of the arm, the clavicle with respect to the thorax generally undergoes elevation (11 degrees-15 degrees maximum), retraction (15 degrees-29 degrees maximum), and posterior long-axis rotation (15 degrees-31 degrees maximum), with variability between subjects and planes of motion regarding the magnitude of motion. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation approaches attempting to improve shoulder motion should benefit from improved knowledge of 3-dimensional contributions of the clavicle to normal and abnormal scapular kinematics.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated the role of dietary factors on knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression. We examined the prospective association of dietary fat intake with radiographic progression of knee OA. METHODS: In the Osteoarthritis Initiative, 2,092 participants with radiographic knee OA and having baseline dietary data were followed at yearly intervals up to 48 months. Dietary intakes of fatty acids were assessed with the Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire. To evaluate radiographic progression of knee OA, we used quantitative joint space width (JSW) between the medial femur and tibia of the knee based on fixed-flexion posteroanterior radiographs. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to test the association between dietary fat and JSW loss over time. RESULTS: We observed significant positive relationships of total fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) intakes with JSW loss. With increasing quartiles of total fat intake, JSW decreases over 48 months were 0.26 mm, 0.27 mm, 0.31 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively (P\,=\,0.02 for trend). Similar association was observed between SFA intake and JSW loss. In contrast, higher intakes of mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and higher ratio of PUFA to SFA were associated with a reduced JSW loss. CONCLUSION: High intakes of total fat and SFA may be associated with increased structural knee OA progression, while MUFA and PUFA may reduce radiographic progression. Replication of these novel findings in other prospective studies is needed to confirm if reduction in SFA intake and increase in unsaturated fat intake lead to delayed knee OA progression.},

  abstract = {Wallenberg syndrome was first described in 1808 by Gaspard Vieusseux. However, a more detailed description given in 1895 by Adolf Wallenberg~identified this condition as infarction of the lateral medulla oblongata following occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA) or Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Wallenberg syndrome is also called lateral medullary or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome. This neurological disorder is associated with various symptoms that result from damage to the lateral segment of the medulla posterior to the inferior olivary nucleus. Anatomy The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) usually originates from the vertebral artery at an average distance of approximately 16 or 17 mm below the vertebrobasilar junction. The vertebral artery, arising from the subclavian artery, is classically divided into four segments. The fourth segment of the vertebral artery gives off the PICA, the largest branch of the vertebral artery. The trunk of PICA is divided into five segments: 1. The anterior medullary segment begins at the origin of the PICA. It ends at the level of a rostrocaudal line that passes through the most prominent part of the inferior olive. 2. The lateral medullary segment extends from the level of the most prominent point of the olive to the level of the origin of the glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X), and accessory (CN XI) rootlets. 3. The tonsillomedullary segment begins where the PICA passes posterior to the CN IX-XI and ends at the midpoint of the PICA's ascent toward the roof of the fourth ventricle along the medial surface of the tonsil. 4. The telovelotonsillar segment begins where the PICA ascends to the mid-level of the medial surface of the tonsil and ends where the artery exits the fissures between the tonsil, vermis, and hemisphere to reach the suboccipital surface. 5. The cortical segment begins where the PICA leaves the groove between the vermis, tonsil, and hemisphere and includes the terminal cortical branches. The trunk of PICA gives rise to perforating, choroidal, and cortical branches. The PICA supplies the medulla, the choroid plexus, the tela choroidea of the fourth ventricle, the tonsils, the inferior vermis, and the inferior aspects of the cerebellar hemispheres.~Furthermore, the PICA mostly supplies the choroid plexus on the roof and the median opening of the fourth ventricle and~provides the majority of branches of the choroid plexus.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Both meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are common brain tumors. In many cases, these lesions are found incidentally on imaging when patients are being evaluated for a variety of symptoms and signs. While nonmalignant, these tumors are occasionally associated with significant morbidity due to location and resulting secondary symptoms. Rarely, these tumors can also transform into malignant variants. Surgical techniques allow for more complete resections with minimal complications. Significant progress is being made in understanding the molecular biology of meningioma, which may result in wider availability of targeted therapies, especially for patients who are not candidates for other therapeutic modalities. Medical therapies for secretory pituitary adenomas continue to evolve. Craniopharyngiomas are nonmalignant tumors associated with significant morbidity due to their location. Molecular subtypes exist and may respond to targeted agents. Glioneuronal tumors are low-grade neoplasms potentially cured by gross total resection; however, residual and recurrent disease may require additional therapy. Recent studies have identified potentially targetable molecular alterations in more than half of cases.                                         SUMMARY               Meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are frequently encountered in neurologic practice, and familiarity with their presentation and management is essential for a practicing neurologist. Craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas, and glioneuronal tumors are characterized by a high frequency of potentially actionable genetic alterations, and targeted therapies may eventually supplement surgical therapy of these nonmalignant tumors.},

Follow-up time ranged from one to five years, with a mean of 2.5 years. Symptoms mimicking the well known iliotibial band (ITB) friction syndrome were observed in 77 knees (7.2\%). Initial conservative treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory medication (77 knees) and local steroid injection (35 knees). The pain persisted in 22 knees (2\%), leading to a surgical release of the iliotibial band. Other surgical interventions included revision for infection (6 knees, 0.5\%), revision for tibial component loosening (6 knees, 0.5\%), revision for tibiofemoral dislocation (3 knees, 0.3\%), revision for patellar component loosening (5 knees, 0.4\%), revision for instability (1 knee, 0.1\%) and secondary patellar resurfacing (1 knee, 0.1\%). The overall survivorship with partial or total implant revision as an endpoint was 98\%. The development of lateral knee pain in association with the use of a guided motion design can be explained by the forced posterior translation of the lateral condyle in flexion. The asymmetric cam and post mechanism, acting as a hard driver of posterior femoral translation and internal tibial rotation during flexion, does not allow for the natural kinematic variability occurring in native knees. This repetitive and forced stretching of the ITB seems to induce a painful traction syndrome in some patients.},

Neurologic outcome prediction, or neuroprognostication, is a complex undertaking with many important ramifications. It allows patients with good prognoses to be supported aggressively, survive, and recover; conversely, it avoids inappropriate prolonged and costly care in those with devastating injuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Striving to maintain a high prediction performance during prognostic assessments encompasses acknowledging the shortcomings of this task and the challenges created by advances in medicine, which constantly shift the natural history of neurologic conditions. Embracing the unknowns of outcome prediction and the boundaries of knowledge surrounding neurologic recovery and plasticity is a necessary step toward refining neuroprognostication practices and improving the accuracy of prognostic impressions. The pillars of modern neuroprognostication include comprehensive characterization of neurologic injury burden (primary and secondary injuries), gauging cerebral resilience and estimated neurologic reserve, and tying it all together with individual values surrounding the acceptable extent of disability and the difficulties of an arduous convalescence journey.

The cardiorespiratory system is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and energy substrates to the brain. Therefore, diseases of the heart and lungs can lead to various neurologic illnesses. This article reviews various cardiac and pulmonary pathologies that can lead to neurologic injury and discusses the relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               We have lived through unprecedented times over the past 3 years with the emergence and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the effects of COVID-19 on the lungs and heart, an increased incidence of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and stroke associated with cardiorespiratory pathologies has been observed. Newer evidence has questioned the benefit of induced hypothermia in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Further, global collaborative initiatives such as the Curing Coma Campaign are underway with the goal of improving the care of patients with coma and disorders of consciousness, including those resulting from cardiac and pulmonary pathologies.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The neurologic complications of cardiorespiratory disorders are common and present in various forms such as stroke or hypoxic and anoxic injury related to cardiac or respiratory failure. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, neurologic complications have increased in recent years. Given the intimate and interdependent dynamics of the heart, lungs, and brain, it is crucial for neurologists to be aware of the interplay between these organs.},

Recent Findings:               Fabry disease causes early-onset stroke, particularly of the vertebrobasilar system; enzyme replacement therapy should be considered in affected patients. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, causes migraines, early-onset lacunar strokes, and dementia. Moyamoya disease can cause either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; revascularization is recommended in some patients. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy causes both microhemorrhages and macrohemorrhages, resulting in typical stroke symptoms and progressive dementia. Pregnancy raises the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in women with preeclampsia/eclampsia. Pregnant women are also at risk for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Experts recommend that pregnant women with acute ischemic stroke not be systematically denied the potential benefits of IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.                                         Summary:               Neurologists should become familiar with these uncommon causes of stroke to provide future risk assessment and family counseling and to implement appropriate treatment plans to prevent recurrence.},

The examiner must aim to determine the exact tissue that pain arises from to make the specific diagnosis. Lumbar disc herniation is 1 disease that physical examination, symptoms, and findings on imaging technique do not always correlate with each other. The Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test has been used as the primary test to diagnosis lumbar disc herniations and found to have high correlation with findings on operation since its sensitivity is high in only disc herniations leading to root compression that may eventually need operation. More sensitive test, like the Slump, might be used in herniations in which the SLR is negative. The Slump test is really a variant of the SLR and the Las{\`e}gue's tests performed in the seated position and is a progressive series of maneuvers designed to place the sciatic nerve roots under increasing tension. At each step in the procedure, the patient informs the examiner what is being felt and whether radicular pain is produced. As a result, the Slump test applies traction to the nerve roots by incorporating spinal and hip joint flexion into the leg raising and would warn the examiner of the presence of nerve root compression when there is a negative SLR test. OBJECTIVES: This study measured the sensitivity and specificity of the Slump test and compare it with the SLR test in patients with and without lumbar disc herniations. METHODS: A prospective case control study of 75 patients with complaints suggestive of lumbar disc herniation was carried out in the outpatient clinics of the neurosurgery department of a state teaching hospital. Seventy-five referred or self-admitted patients with low back, leg, or low back and leg pain who had results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine were included in the study. Thirty-eight patients had signs of herniation demonstrated by MRI. Control patients (n = 37) had no disc bulges or herniations on MRI. Both the Slump and SLR tests were performed during the assessment of all the patients by the second author. The MRI results were assessed and recorded by the first author. RESULTS: The Slump test was found to be more sensitive (0.84) than the SLR (0.52) in the patients with lumbar disc herniations. However, the SLR was found to be a slightly more specific test (0.89) than the Slump test (0.83). CONCLUSION: The Slump test might be used more frequently as a sensitive physical examination tool in patients with symptoms of lumbar disc herniations. In contrast, owing to its higher specificity, the SLR test may especially help identify patients who have herniations with root compression requiring surgery.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The classification of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies has improved with the integration of myositis-specific antibodies and histopathologic findings. Characteristic features of immune checkpoint inhibitor{\textendash}related myositis have been identified, allowing early recognition and treatment of the syndrome. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the care of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and several mechanisms of virus-related muscle injury have been proposed.                                         SUMMARY               A comprehensive evaluation including clinical examination, EMG, imaging, antibody testing, muscle biopsy, and cancer screening, when appropriate, can lead to an earlier accurate diagnosis and an individualized treatment approach for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.},

The thoracic spine is most commonly involved, although involvement can include the thoracolumbar/lumbar region as well . Most commonly, diagnosis is made in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who present after their parents notice a postural deformity or ``hunchbacked'' appearance. Pain in the affected hyperkyphotic region may also be the cause of initial evaluation . There is a hereditary component associated with this condition, although the exact mode of transmission is still unclear. This is supported by the fact that incidence is higher in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins .},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intolerance to various foods, excluding bona fide coeliac disease and lactose intolerance, represents a growing cause of patient visits to allergy clinics.Histamine intolerance is a long-known, multifaceted clinical condition triggered by histamine-rich foods and alcohol and/or by drugs that liberate histamine or block diamine oxidase (DAO), the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of ingested histamine. Histamine limitation diets impose complex, non-standardized restrictions that may severely impact the quality of life of patients. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 14 patients who visited allergy outpatient facilities in northern Italy with a negative diagnosis for IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity, coeliac disease, conditions related to gastric hypersecretion, and systemic nickel hypersensitivity, and who previously underwent a histamine limitation diet with benefits for their main symptoms. Serum diamine oxidase levels and the clinical response to diamine oxidase supplementation were investigated. RESULTS: We found that 10 out of 14 patients had serum DAO activity{$<$}10 U/mL, which was the threshold suggested as a cutoff for probable histamine intolerance. Moreover, 13 out of 14 patients subjectively reported a benefit in at least one of the disturbances related to food intolerances following diamine oxidase supplementation. The mean value ({$\pm$}SD) of diamine oxidase activity in the cohort of patients with histamine intolerance symptoms was 7.04{$\pm$}6.90 U/mL compared to 39.50{$\pm$}18.16 U/mL in 34 healthy controls (P=0.0031). CONCLUSION: In patients with symptoms triggered by histamine-rich food, measuring the serum diamine oxidase activity can help identify subjects who can benefit from a histamine limitation diet and/or diamine oxidase supplementation.Properly designed, controlled studies investigating histamine intolerance that include histamine provocation are indispensable for providing insights into the area of food intolerances, which are currently primarily managed with non-scientific approaches in Italy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether fear of re-injury is manifested in joint kinematics and muscle activation patterns during landings of a standardized rebound side-hop (SRSH), or in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), among individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, 38 individuals within 2 years post-ACLR were grouped into HIGH-FEAR (n = 21, median 11.2 months post-surgery) or LOW-FEAR (n = 17, median 10.1 months post-surgery) based on a discriminating question (Q9; Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-17). These individuals and 39 asymptomatic controls performed the SRSH. Three-dimensional motion recordings were used to calculate trunk, hip, and knee joint angles at initial contact and range of respective joint motion during landing. Surface electromyography registered mean amplitudes and co-contraction indexes for thigh muscles during pre-activation (50 ms) and landing phases. PROMs of knee function, knee health, and physical activity were also analyzed. RESULTS: The HIGH-FEAR and LOW-FEAR classification was corroborated by distinct Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-17 total and subscale scores and revealed distinguishable muscle activation patterns. HIGH-FEAR demonstrated higher biceps femoris electromyography amplitude and higher anterior-posterior co-contraction index during landing than both LOW-FEAR and controls. However, there were no fear-related differences for kinematics or PROMs. Instead, both ACLR subgroups showed different kinematics at initial contact to controls; HIGH-FEAR with more trunk, hip, and knee flexion, and LOW-FEAR with more hip and knee flexion. CONCLUSION: Individuals with ACLR who had high fear of re-injury seem to have adopted a protective strategy with higher muscular activation patterns, presumably to stabilize the knee joint, compared with individuals with low fear of re-injury and controls. SRSH landing kinematics or knee-related PROMs may not be as sensitive to fear of re-injury. IMPACT: Fear of reinjury following anterior cruciate ligament injury should be evaluated as an independent psychological outcome throughout rehabilitation after ACLR for improved return to sport transition. LAY SUMMARY: If you have an anterior cruciate ligament injury treated with reconstructive surgery, you might have a high fear of reinjury, and that can change how you activate the muscles around your knee. Your physical therapist can do a simple screening test in addition to functional tests to help reduce your fear and improve your treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the process and outcomes of using a new evidence base to develop scientific guidelines that specify the type and minimum dose of exercise necessary to improve fitness and cardiometabolic health in adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: International. METHODS: Using Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II reporting criteria, steps included (a) determining the guidelines' scope; (b) conducting a systematic review of relevant literature; (c) holding three consensus panel meetings (European, Canadian and International) to formulate the guidelines; (d) obtaining stakeholder feedback; and (e) process evaluation by an AGREE II consultant. Stakeholders were actively involved in steps (c) and (d). RESULTS: For cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength benefits, adults with a SCI should engage in at least 20\,min of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise 2 times per week AND 3 sets of strength exercises for each major functioning muscle group, at a moderate to vigorous intensity, 2 times per week (strong recommendation). For cardiometabolic health benefits, adults with a SCI are suggested to engage in at least 30\,min of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise 3 times per week (conditional recommendation). CONCLUSIONS: Through a systematic, rigorous, and participatory process involving international scientists and stakeholders, a new exercise guideline was formulated for cardiometabolic health benefits. A previously published SCI guideline was endorsed for achieving fitness benefits. These guidelines represent an important step toward international harmonization of exercise guidelines for adults with SCI, and a foundation for developing exercise policies and programs for people with SCI around the world.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Pediatric presentations of sleep disorders differ from adult presentations, making diagnosis challenging. Specific clinical syndromes, such as cataplexy in children with narcolepsy type 1, can have an altogether different presentation compared to adult-onset symptoms, contributing to diagnostic delays and potential misdiagnoses. More broadly, research shows strong associations between sleep and daytime cognition, mood, and behavior among children with and without neurologic conditions and thus suggests a need to identify and treat sleep problems to optimize daytime functioning.

Collagen, a key component of the extracellular matrix, plays critical roles in the regulation of the phases of wound healing either in its native, fibrillar conformation or as soluble components in the wound milieu. Impairments in any of these phases stall the wound in a chronic, non-healing state that typically requires some form of intervention to guide the process back to completion. Key factors in the hostile environment of a chronic wound are persistent inflammation, increased destruction of ECM components caused by elevated metalloproteinases and other enzymes and improper activation of soluble mediators of the wound healing process. Collagen, being central in the regulation of several of these processes, has been utilized as an adjunct wound therapy to promote healing. In this work the significance of collagen in different biological processes relevant to wound healing are reviewed and a summary of the current literature on the use of collagen-based products in wound care is provided.},

Lack of recognition of common OCD symptom types, in addition to shame and fear of stigma on the part of patients, has created an average delay in diagnosis by almost 10 years and a delay in effective treatment (ie, a treatment gap) of nearly 2 years. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically a form of CBT that includes a type of behavioral intervention called                 exposure and response prevention                 , remains the most effective form of treatment for OCD. If CBT is not effective or not available, pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine, a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can also be of benefit. Neuromodulation approaches such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation are rapidly emerging as effective treatments for OCD, particularly for patients who have not experienced an adequate response to psychotherapy or pharmacologic management.                                                        SUMMARY               OCD affects more than one in every 50 adults in the United States but is recognized and adequately treated in fewer than half of those affected. Early intervention and appropriate treatment can substantially reduce OCD symptom severity, improve quality of life, and minimize the functional disability associated with this chronic and often debilitating illness.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Cerebrovascular complications can occur in patients with blood cell and platelet disorders. Treatment strategies to prevent stroke are available for patients with sickle cell disease, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. A diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be considered in patients with neurologic symptoms, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, mild renal insufficiency, and fever. Plasma cell disorders can be associated with peripheral neuropathy, and classification of the monoclonal protein type and neuropathy aid in diagnosis. Patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, and skin changes) syndrome can present with arterial and venous neurologic events.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inspite of common lifting advice to maintain a lordotic posture, there is debate regarding optimal lumbar spine posture during lifting. To date, the influence of lumbar posture on trunk muscle recruitment, strength and efficiency during high intensity lifting has not been fully explored. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do differences in lumbar posture influence trunk extensor strength (moment), trunk muscle activity, and neuromuscular efficiency during maximal lifting? METHODS: Twenty-six healthy participants adopted three lumbar postures (maximal extension (lordotic), mid-range (flat-back), and fully flexed) in a free lifting position. Motion analysis and force measurements were used to determine the back extensor, hip and knee moments. Surface electromyography (EMG) of three trunk extensors and the internal obliques were recorded. Neuromuscular efficiency (NME) was expressed as a ratio of normalised extensor moment to normalised EMG. RESULTS: Significantly higher back extensor moments were exerted when moving from an extended to mid-range, and from a mid-range to fully flexed lumbar posture. This was accompanied by a decrease in activity across all three back extensor muscles (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) resulting in a higher NME of these muscles in more flexed postures. Change in lumbar posture did not influence hip or knee moments or internal oblique activation. SIGNIFICANCE: A flexed-back posture is associated with increased strength and efficiency of the back muscles compared to a lordotic posture. These findings further question the manual handling advice to lift with a lordotic lumbar spine.},

Central to their function is their ability to be recruited to sites of infection, to recognize and phagocytose microbes, and then to kill pathogens through a combination of cytotoxic mechanisms. These include the production of reactive oxygen species, the release of antimicrobial peptides, and the recently discovered expulsion of their nuclear contents to form neutrophil extracellular traps. Here we discuss these primordial neutrophil functions, which also play key roles in tissue injury, by providing details of neutrophil cytotoxic functions and congenital disorders of neutrophils. In addition, we present more recent evidence that interactions between neutrophils and adaptive immune cells establish a feed-forward mechanism that amplifies pathologic inflammation. These newly appreciated contributions of neutrophils are described in the setting of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.},

However, few studies have provided a synthesis of all available literature. The purpose of this study was to obtain, critique and synthesise all literature specific to acute surfing injuries, and evaluate differences in injury type, mechanism and location between HCF and survey data. A systematic literature review design was used to identify relevant articles from three major databases. Peer-reviewed epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal surfing injuries were included. A modified AXIS tool was used for critical appraisal, and objective data was extracted and synthesized by lead researchers. Overall frequencies for injury location, type and mechanism were calculated from raw injury data. A total of 19 cross-sectional articles of fair to good quality (Modified AXIS 54.2-83.3\%) were included in this study; 17 were National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) level III-2 (retrospective) and two were level II (prospective). Articles examined competitive, recreational and combined populations. Injury data from Australia, Brazil, UK, USA, Portugal, Japan, Norway, and worldwide were represented. Skin (46.0\%; HCF 50.1\%, survey 43.8\%) and being struck by own surfboard (38.6\%; HCF 73.4\%, survey 36.7\%) were the most common injury type and mechanism. Head, face and neck injuries were most common in HCF (43.1\%) versus lower limb injuries (36.4\%) in survey data. Incidence proportion was highest in aerialists (0.48). Incidence rate (number of injuries per 1000 h) ranged from 0.74 in Australian surfers (Melbourne) to 6.6 in international contest surfers from medical record data. This review highlights the prevalence of skin, board-related, head, face and neck, and lower limb surfing injuries across available literature. Proposed use of protective equipment and foam-based surfboards in dangerous or crowded surf locations may reduce injury risk.},

Traditionally, diagnostic categories are based on a pathoanatomic medical model aimed at identifying the pathologic tissues. However, the pathoanatomic model may not provide diagnostic categories that effectively guide treatment decision making in rehabilitation. An expanded classification system is proposed that includes the pathoanatomic diagnosis and a rehabilitation classification based on tissue irritability and identified impairments. For the rehabilitation classification, 3 levels of irritability are proposed and defined, with corresponding strategies guiding intensity of treatment based on the physical stress theory. Common impairments are identified and are used to guide specific intervention tactics with varying levels of intensity. The proposed system is conceptual and needs to be tested for reliability and validity. This classification system may be useful clinically for guiding rehabilitation intervention and provides a potential method of identifying relevant subgroups in future research studies. Although the system was developed for and applied to shoulder disorders, it may be applicable to classification and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal disorders in other body regions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in fluid (CSF and blood-based) and imaging biomarkers are allowing for a more precise and earlier diagnosis of AD (relative to non-AD dementias) across the disease spectrum and in patients with atypical clinical features. Specifically, tau- and amyloid-related AD pathologic changes can now be measured by CSF, plasma, and positron emission tomography (PET) with good precision. Additionally, a better understanding of risk factors for AD has highlighted the need for clinicians to address comorbidities to maximize prevention of cognitive decline in those at risk or to slow decline in patients who are symptomatic. Recent clinical trials of amyloid-lowering drugs have provided not only some optimism that amyloid reduction or prevention may be beneficial but also a recognition that addressing additional targets will be necessary for significant disease modification.                                         SUMMARY               Recent developments in fluid and imaging biomarkers have led to the improved understanding of AD as a chronic condition with a protracted presymptomatic phase followed by the clinical stage traditionally recognized by neurologists. As clinical trials of potential disease-modifying therapies continue, important developments in the understanding of the disease will improve clinical care now and lead to more effective therapies in the near future.},

Overuse injuries predominate in the professional golfer, and amateur golfer injury tends to occur secondary to an incorrect golf swing. Upper limb injuries are also common due to their role in linking the fast moving golf club with the power-generating torso. Fortunately, injury from a club or ball strike is rare. More common are the overuse injuries associated with the back, neck and shoulder. Most golf injury data have been collected retrospectively and further epidemiological study of a prospective nature is required to determine injury incidence and factor relating to the onset of injury.},

Like all non-parametric statistics, the Chi-square is robust with respect to the distribution of the data. Specifically, it does not require equality of variances among the study groups or homoscedasticity in the data. It permits evaluation of both dichotomous independent variables, and of multiple group studies. Unlike many other non-parametric and some parametric statistics, the calculations needed to compute the Chi-square provide considerable information about how each of the groups performed in the study. This richness of detail allows the researcher to understand the results and thus to derive more detailed information from this statistic than from many others. The Chi-square is a significance statistic, and should be followed with a strength statistic. The Cramer's V is the most common strength test used to test the data when a significant Chi-square result has been obtained. Advantages of the Chi-square include its robustness with respect to distribution of the data, its ease of computation, the detailed information that can be derived from the test, its use in studies for which parametric assumptions cannot be met, and its flexibility in handling data from both two group and multiple group studies. Limitations include its sample size requirements, difficulty of interpretation when there are large numbers of categories (20 or more) in the independent or dependent variables, and tendency of the Cramer's V to produce relative low correlation measures, even for highly significant results.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

  abstract = {Found in all vertebrates, creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP forming phosphocreatine and ADP. Phosphocreatine may be viewed as a reservoir of "high-energy phosphate" which is able to supply ATP, the primary energy source in bioenergetics, on demand. Consequently, creatine kinase plays a significant role in energy homeostasis of cells with intermittently high energy requirements. The enzyme is of clinical importance and its levels are routinely used as an indicator of myocardial and skeletal muscle disorders and for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. First identified in 1928, the enzyme has undergone intensive investigation for over 75 years. There are four major isozymes, two cytosolic and two mitochondrial, which form dimers and octamers, respectively. Depending on the pH, the enzyme operates by a random or an ordered bimolecular mechanism, with the equilibrium lying towards phosphocreatine production. Evidence suggests that conversion of creatine to phosphocreatine occurs via the in-line transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP. A recent X-ray structure of creatine kinase bound to a transition state analog complex confirmed many of the predictions based on kinetic, spectroscopic, and mutagenesis studies. This review summarizes and correlates the more significant mechanistic and structural studies on creatine kinase.},

  abstract = {Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represents a growth factor with important pro-angiogenic activity, having a mitogenic and an anti-apoptotic effect on endothelial cells, increasing the vascular permeability, promoting cell migration, etc. Due to these effects, it actively contributes in regulating the normal and pathological angiogenic processes. In humans, the VEGF family is composed of several members: VEGF-A (which has different isoforms), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E (viral VEGF), VEGF-F (snake venom VEGF), placenta growth factor (PlGF), and, recently, to this family has been added endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF). VEGF binds to tyrosine kinase cell receptors (VEGFRs): VEGFR-1 [Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1)], VEGFR-2 [kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) in human; fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) in mouse] and VEGFR-3 [Fms-like tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt-4)]. While VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are expressed predominantly on vascular endothelial cells, VEGFR-3 is expressed especially on lymphatic endothelial cells. VEGFR-2 has the strongest pro-angiogenic activity and a higher tyrosine kinase activity than VEGFR-1. Endothelial cells also express co-receptors, such as neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and neuropilin-2 (NP-2), which modulate tyrosine kinase receptor activity. Both VEGF and VEGFRs are expressed not only on endothelial cells, but also on non-endothelial cells. This article aims to highlight the most recent data referring to the VEGF family and its receptors, as well as its implications in the angiogenesis process. At present, blocking angiogenesis in cancer or in other pathological processes, using anti-VEGF and anti-VEGFRs therapies, is considered to be extremely important.},

While early-onset AD is often overshadowed by the more common late-onset AD, recognition of the differences between early- and late-onset AD is important for clinicians.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early-onset AD comprises about 5\% to 6\% of cases of AD and includes a substantial percentage of phenotypic variants that differ from the usual amnestic presentation of typical AD. Characteristics of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include a larger genetic predisposition (familial mutations and summed polygenic risk), more aggressive course, more frequent delay in diagnosis, higher prevalence of traumatic brain injury, less memory impairment and greater involvement of other cognitive domains on presentation, and greater psychosocial difficulties. Neuroimaging features of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include greater frequency of hippocampal sparing and posterior neocortical atrophy, increased tau burden, and greater connectomic changes affecting frontoparietal networks rather than the default mode network.                                         SUMMARY               Early-onset AD differs substantially from late-onset AD, with different phenotypic presentations, greater genetic predisposition, and differences in neuropathologic burden and topography. Early-onset AD more often presents with nonamnestic phenotypic variants that spare the hippocampi and with greater tau burden in posterior neocortices. The early-onset AD phenotypic variants involve different neural networks than typical AD. The management of early-onset AD is similar to that of late-onset AD but with special emphasis on targeting specific cognitive areas and more age-appropriate psychosocial support and education.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in acute stroke treatment, including the use of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion and, more recently, of IV thrombolysis in an extended time window, have resulted in a paradigm shift in how imaging is used in patients with acute stroke. This paradigm shift, combined with the understanding that ``time is brain,'' means that imaging must be fast, reliable, and available around the clock for physicians to make appropriate clinical decisions. CT has therefore become the primary imaging modality of choice. Recognition of a large vessel occlusion using CT angiography has become essential in identifying patients for endovascular thrombectomy, and techniques such as imaging collaterals on CT angiography or measuring blood flow to predict tissue fate using CT perfusion have become useful tools in selecting patients for acute stroke therapy. Understanding the use of these imaging modalities and techniques in dealing with an emergency such as acute stroke has therefore become more important than ever for physicians treating patients with acute stroke.                                         SUMMARY               Imaging the brain and the blood vessels supplying it using modern tools and techniques is a key step in understanding the pathophysiology of acute stroke and making appropriate and timely clinical decisions.},

This article provides an evidence-based approach to confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, characterizing comorbidities that provide insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of stroke, and identifying targets for treatment to optimize the prevention of recurrent stroke.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Identifying the presence of patent foramen ovale, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and unstable plaque is now routinely included in an increasingly nuanced workup in patients with stroke, even as ongoing trials seek to clarify the best approaches for treating these and other comorbidities. Multicenter trials have demonstrated the therapeutic utility of patent foramen ovale closure in select patients younger than age 60 years. Insertable cardiac monitors detect atrial fibrillation lasting more than 30 seconds in about one in ten patients monitored for 12 months following a stroke. MRI of carotid plaque can detect unstable plaque at risk of being a source of cerebral embolism.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               To optimize the prevention of recurrent stroke, it is important to consider pathologies of intracranial and extracranial blood vessels and of cardiac structure and rhythm as well as other inherited or systemic causes of stroke. Some aspects of the stroke workup should be done routinely, while other components will depend on the clinical circumstances and preliminary testing results.},

High speed videography (200 fps), a force platform (500 Hz), and a Cybex II+ isokinetic dynamometer were used to assess rearfoot motion, ground reaction forces, and knee muscular strength and endurance, respectively. A linear discriminant function analysis of the training data revealed weekly mileage, training pace, number of months using current training protocol, \% time spent swimming, and \% time spent running on a track to be significant (P {$<$} 0.10). Height was a significant anthropometric discriminator, while seven isokinetic strength and endurance measures were found to discriminate significantly between the groups. Calcaneal to vertical touchdown angle, and maximum supination velocity were significant rearfoot movement discriminators. Maximum braking force was the only significant kinetic discriminator. A combined discriminant analysis using those variables found to be significant in the previous analyses revealed weekly mileage, and maximum normalized braking force to be the best discriminators (model P {$<$} 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

DESIGN: We reviewed high level athletes with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture on either MRI or arthroscopic evaluation more than 10 years previously, who were treated conservatively. They were pair-matched with patients who had had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patella-tendon-bone, with respect to age, gender and Tegner activity score before injury. PARTICIPANTS: In total 50 patients were pair-matched. RESULTS: We found no statistical difference between the patients treated conservatively or operatively with respect to osteoarthritis or meniscal lesions of the knee, as well as activity level, objective and subjective functional outcome. The patients who were treated operatively had a significantly better stability of the knee at examination. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the instability repair using a bone-patella-tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a good knee stabilising operation. Both treatment options however show similar patient outcome at 10 year follow up.},

  abstract = {Injury patterns in distance running may be related to kinematic adjustments induced by fatigue. The goal was to measure changes in lower extremity mechanics during an exhaustive run in individuals with and without a history of iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS). Sixteen recreational runners ran to voluntary exhaustion on a treadmill at a self-selected pace. Eight runners had a history of ITBS. Twenty-three reflective marker positions were recorded by an eight-camera 120 Hz motion capture system. Joint angles during stance phase were exported to a musculoskeletal model (SIMM) with the iliotibial band (ITB) modeled as a passive structure to estimate strain in the ITB. For ITBS runners, at the end of the run: (1) knee flexion at heel-strike was higher than control (20.6 degrees versus 15.3 degrees, p=0.01); (2) the number of knees with predicted ITB impingment upon the lateral femoral epicondyle increased from 6 to 11. Strain in the ITB was higher in the ITBS runners throughout all of stance. Maximum foot adduction in the ITBS runners was higher versus control at the start of the run (p=0.003). Maximum foot inversion (p=0.03) and maximum knee internal rotation velocity (p=0.02) were higher versus control at the end of the run. In conclusion, ITB mechanics appear to be related to changes in knee flexion at heel-strike and internal rotation of the leg. These observations may suggest kinematic discriminators for clinical assessment.},

  abstract = {Surfing has rapidly grown in popularity as the sport made its debut at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Surfing injuries are becoming more relevant with the globalisation and increasing risks of the sport, but despite this, little is known about surfing injuries or prevention strategies in either the competitive or recreational surfer. Prior research demonstrates that surfers are injured at a frequency of 0.74-1.79 injuries per 1000 hours of surfing. We reviewed the literature for the incidence, anatomical distribution, type and underlying mechanism of acute and overuse injuries, and discuss current preventative measures. This review finds that skin injuries represent the highest proportion of total injuries. Acute injuries most frequently affect the head, neck and face, followed by the lower limbs. Being struck by one's own board is the most common mechanism of injury. Non-contact acute ligament injuries have increased as surfing manoeuvres have become more acrobatic and overuse musculoskeletal injuries are highly correlated with paddling. However, there is a paucity of research for surfing injuries, and studies on overuse musculoskeletal injuries and prevention are disproportionally under-represented. Most of the prior studies are limited by small sample sizes, poor data collection methodology and geographical constraints. Further research is needed to establish preventative measures for both acute and overuse surfing injuries and to ensure the increasing popularity of surfing is met with an improved understanding of sport risks and safety. Specifically, we recommend research be prioritised regarding the efficacy of training programmes to prevent surfing-related overuse musculoskeletal injuries.},

Recent studies have measured the physiological effects of physical therapy interventions, including manual therapy and traction, on the intervertebral discs (IVD), and these findings may have implications for the long-term management or even prevention of low back pain. PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the literature regarding possible physiological effects of physical therapy interventions on the intervertebral disc (IVD). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review. METHODS: A literature search of published articles through December 2014 resulted in the retrieval of 8 clinical studies assessing the influence of physical therapy interventions on the physiology of the IVD. RESULTS: Three studies, including two using animal models, investigated the effects of 30-minute intermittent traction on disc height. One in vivo animal study and two studies using human subjects assessed changes of disc height associated with static traction. Three studies investigated the effects of lumbar spine manipulation and mobilization on changes in water diffusion within the IVD. All studies confirmed, either directly or indirectly, that their respective intervention influenced disc physiology primarily through water flow. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy interventions may have an effect on the physiology of the IVD, primarily through water diffusion and molecular transport, which are important for the health of the IVD.},

OMs also provide a mechanism to compare patient and organizational outcomes, examine intervention effectiveness, and generate new knowledge. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) examined the literature related to OMs of balance, gait, transfers, and patient-stated goals to identify a core set of OMs for use across adults with neurologic conditions and practice settings.                                         Methods:               To determine the scope of this CPG, surveys were conducted to assess the needs and priorities of consumers and physical therapists. OMs were identified through recommendations of the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy's Evidence Database to Guide Effectiveness task forces. A systematic review of the literature on the OMs was conducted and additional OMs were identified; the literature search was repeated on these measures. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by 2 reviewers using a modified version of the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments. (COSMIN) checklist. Methodological quality and the strength of statistical results were determined. To be recommended for the core set, the OMs needed to demonstrate excellent psychometric properties in high-quality studies across neurologic conditions.                                         Results/Discussion:               Based on survey results, the CPG focuses on OMs that have acceptable clinical utility and can be used to assess change over time in a patient's balance, gait, transfers, and patient-stated goals. Strong, level I evidence supports the use of the Berg Balance Scale to assess changes in static and dynamic sitting and standing balance and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale to assess changes in balance confidence. Strong to moderate evidence supports the use of the Functional Gait Assessment to assess changes in dynamic balance while walking, the 10 meter Walk Test to assess changes in gait speed, and the 6-Minute Walk Test to assess changes in walking distance. Best practice evidence supports the use of the 5 Times Sit-to-Stand to assess sit to standing transfers. Evidence was insufficient to support use of a specific OM to assess patient-stated goals across adult neurologic conditions. Physical therapists should discuss the OM results with patients and collaboratively decide how the results should inform the plan of care.

  abstract = {The exteroceptive capabilities of the nociceptive system have long been thought to be considerably more limited than those of the tactile system. However, most investigations of spatio-temporal aspects of the nociceptive system have largely focused on intensity coding as consequence of spatial or temporal summation. Graphesthesia, the identification of numbers "written" on the skin, and assessment of the two-point discrimination thresholds were used to compare the exteroceptive capabilities of the tactile and nociceptive systems. Numbers were "written" on the forearm and the abdomen by tactile stimulation and by painful non-contact infrared laser heat stimulation. Subjects performed both graphesthesia tasks better than chance. The tactile graphesthesia tasks were performed with 89\% (82-97\%) correct responses on the forearm and 86\% (79-94\%) correct responses on the abdomen. Tactile graphesthesia tasks were significantly better than painful heat graphesthesia tasks that were performed with 31\% (23-40\%) and 44\% (37-51\%) correct responses on the forearm and abdomen, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the central nervous system is capable of assembling complex spatio-temporal patterns of nociceptive information from the body surface into unified mental objects with sufficient accuracy to enable behavioral discrimination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Communication during clinical encounters can be challenging with patients with communication disabilities. Physicians have the potential to positively affect the encounter by using communication strategies that engage the patient in patient-centered communication. OBJECTIVE: We engaged patients and their physicians in defining their preferences for patient-centered communication strategies, then evaluated the use of the identified strategies during observed clinical encounters. METHODS: We video-recorded 25 clinical encounters with persons with aphasia. All encounters were previously scheduled with community physicians and a companion was present. Following each encounter, physicians completed a brief questionnaire and the person with aphasia and his or her companion participated in a video elicitation interview. RESULTS: While many of the communication strategies identified and described by physicians, patients and companions were similar, patients and companions identified three additional key communication strategies. These strategies included (1) using visual aids, (2) writing down key words while speaking, and (3) using gestures. In the video recorded clinical encounters, no physicians wrote down key words while speaking and only one used a visual aid during the clinical encounter. The frequency with which physicians used gestures varied greatly, even within the same patient, suggesting the use of gestures was independent of patient or companion characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize patient-centered communication with patients with communication disabilities, physicians should use "disability-specific" communication strategies. Our study suggests that physicians should routinely ask patients and companions about communication preferences and then incorporate identified communication strategies into their communication style.},

Such pathology most often affects the anterior portion of the nerve and is visible on funduscopic examination. Ischemic optic neuropathy is associated with typical vascular risk factors and with one systemic disease in particular: giant cell arteritis (GCA). This article provides an overview of the three major classes of ischemic optic neuropathy, including information on risk factors, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Optical coherence tomography provides precise anatomic imaging in ischemic optic neuropathy, showing neural loss weeks before it is visible on examination. Refinements of optical coherence tomography reveal optic nerve microvasculature and may assist in understanding pathogenesis and verifying diagnosis. New diagnostic algorithms and cranial vascular imaging techniques help define the likelihood of GCA in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy. Finally, intraocular drug and biological agent delivery holds promise for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, whereas newer immunologic agents may provide effective steroid-sparing treatment for GCA.                                         SUMMARY               It is essential to recognize ischemic optic neuropathy upon presentation, especially to determine the likelihood of GCA and the need for immediate steroid therapy. A broad differential diagnosis should be considered so as not to miss alternative treatable pathology, especially in cases with retrobulbar optic nerve involvement.},

The basic premise of the PST is that changes in the relative level of physical stress cause a predictable adaptive response in all biological tissue. Specific thresholds define the upper and lower stress levels for each characteristic tissue response. Qualitatively, the 5 tissue responses to physical stress are decreased stress tolerance (eg, atrophy), maintenance, increased stress tolerance (eg, hypertrophy), injury, and death. Fundamental principles of tissue adaptation to physical stress are described that, in the authors' opinion, can be used to help guide physical therapy practice, education, and research. The description of fundamental principles is followed by a review of selected literature describing adaptation to physical stress for each of the 4 main organ systems described in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice (ie, cardiovascular/pulmonary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuromuscular). Limitations and implications of the PST for practice, research, and education are presented.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                FSHD has a wide range of severity, yet a distinct phenotype characterized by weakness of the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles, followed by weakness of the trunk and leg muscles. It can be caused by two genetic mechanisms that share a common downstream pathway, namely, the epigenetic derepression and subsequent misexpression of the myotoxic                 DUX4                 transcription factor. Treatment is currently supportive and outlined in evidence-based guidelines. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of FSHD are paving the way for targeted therapy development. Approaches for targeted therapies to reduce                 DUX4                 expression that are currently being explored include small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, vector-based RNA interference, and gene therapy.

SUMMARY               The cornerstones of the diagnosis of FSHD are clinical observation and genetic testing. Management is currently supportive, but progress in the understanding of the disease mechanism has shifted the field of FSHD toward targeted therapy development.},

However, only a relatively small number of studies have investigated the relationship between frontal lobe lesions and performance on the PIT. We compared 52 patients with unselected focal frontal lobe lesions with 52 closely matched healthy controls on a proverb interpretation task. Participants also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, including a fluid intelligence task (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices). Lesions were firstly analysed according to a standard left/right sub-division. Secondly, a finer-grained analysis compared the performance of patients with medial, left lateral and right lateral lesions with healthy controls. Thirdly, a contrast of specific frontal subgroups compared the performance of patients with medial lesions with patients with lateral frontal lesions. The results showed that patients with left frontal lesions were significantly impaired on the PIT, while in patients with right frontal lesions the impairments approached significance. Medial frontal patients were the only frontal subgroup impaired on the PIT, relative to healthy controls and lateral frontal patients. Interestingly, an error analysis indicated that a significantly higher number of concrete responses were found in the left lateral subgroup compared to healthy controls. We found no correlation between scores on the PIT and on the fluid intelligence task. Overall our results suggest that specific regions of the frontal lobes contribute to the performance on the PIT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are characterized by abnormal lipid metabolism manifested as altered fatty acid (FA) profiles of synovial fluid and tissues and in the way dietary FA supplements can influence the symptoms of especially RA. In addition to classic eicosanoids, the potential roles of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA)-derived specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) have become the focus of intensive research. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of the roles of FA and oxylipins in the degradation or protection of synovial joints. RECENT FINDINGS: There exists discordance between the large body of literature from cell culture and animal experiments on the adverse and beneficial effects of individual FA and the lack of effective treatments for joint destruction in OA and RA patients. Saturated 16:0 and 18:0 induce mostly deleterious effects, while long-chain n-3 PUFA, especially 20:5n-3, have positive influence on joint health. The situation can be more complex for n-6 PUFA, such as 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6, and its derivative prostaglandin E2, with a combination of potentially adverse and beneficial effects. SPM analogs have future potential as analgesics for arthritic pain. Alterations in FA profiles and their potential implications in SPM production may affect joint lubrication, synovial inflammation, pannus formation, as well as cartilage and bone degradation and contribute to the pathogeneses of inflammatory joint diseases. Further research directions include high-quality randomized controlled trials on dietary FA supplements and investigations on the significance of lipid composition of microvesicle membrane and cargo in joint diseases.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Ongoing research, building on landmark work regarding parallel distributed processing (PDP), provides the basis for understanding cognitive functions as a manifestation of the activity of populations of millions or billions of neurons in various highly interconnected networks. Population encoding networks have the following intrinsic properties that provide an orderly explanation for normal and degraded language: (1) a capacity for settling into stable ``attractor'' states; (2) processing occurs in and knowledge (long-term memories) is stored in exactly the same network; (3) a capacity for incorporating statistical regularities of experience, frequency, and age of acquisition; (4) support of content-addressable memory; and (5) graceful degradation, such that lesions increase the probability of errors but do not fundamentally transform network operations. Knowledge in parallel distributed processing networks resides in the strength of connections between units (synapses in the brain). Aphasia, whether stemming from stroke or dementing disorders, can be understood in terms of the degradation of one or more domains of knowledge.

RECENT FINDINGS               COVID-19 is the clinical syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It can affect the entire neuraxis, and presentations in the acute phase are variable, although anosmia is a common manifestation. Encephalopathy is common in patients who are hospitalized and is often associated with multiorgan involvement. Immune-mediated encephalitis is probably underrecognized; however, viral encephalitis is rare. Other manifestations include stroke, seizures, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathies, including Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, which sometimes has atypical manifestations. Treatment is symptomatic, and immunotherapies have been used successfully in some patients. Long-term complications include dysautonomia, exercise intolerance, malaise, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 may occur in the acute setting and may be independent of respiratory manifestations. Immune-mediated syndromes and cerebrovascular complications are common. Large populations of patients are expected to have long-term neurologic complications of COVID-19, many of which may emerge only after recovery from the acute illness.},

While the bleeding risks are low, the morbidity or mortality associated with a hemorrhagic event is not insignificant. The objective of this article is to review the natural history of these vascular entities, the risk factors for hemorrhage, preventive treatment options, and the risks of treatment.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Randomized trials to inform preventive treatment strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs are ongoing. Higher angiographic obliteration rates of unruptured intracranial aneurysms have been reported with the flow-diversion technique compared with alternative standard techniques. One randomized trial for unruptured brain AVMs showed a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent interventional treatment compared with observation.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The decision to treat a patient with a brain aneurysm should consider patient factors, the patient's life expectancy, aneurysm anatomical factors, and treatment risks. Patients with unruptured brain AVMs should be observed in light of recent clinical trial data or enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial.},

Its incidence is expected to rise because of the age-related incidence of atrial fibrillation and an aging population. This article summarizes the different causes of cardioembolism and outlines current management guidelines.                                         Recent Findings:               Since cardioembolic stroke is not a single disease entity, its diagnosis requires initial clinical suspicion and a comprehensive evaluation, including ECG, echocardiography, brain imaging, and cardiac monitoring. Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended. This article reviews risk stratification models to assist in the decision-making process and highlights the increased use of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. New data support the importance of prolonged cardiac monitoring for diagnosing occult atrial fibrillation. Current data on other mechanisms of cardioembolic stroke, such as prosthetic heart valves and aortic arch atherosclerosis, are also presented, and the available evidence regarding patent foramen ovale closure in cryptogenic stroke is summarized.                                         Summary:               Cardioembolism is an important cause of ischemic stroke, with diverse underlying mechanisms requiring a tailored approach to diagnosis, management, and prevention.},

More effective approaches to enhance motor recovery following stroke are needed. This article reviews the rehabilitative principles and strategies that can be used to maximize post-stroke recovery.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Evidence dictates that mobilization should not begin prior to 24 hours following stroke, but detailed guidelines beyond this are lacking. Specific classes of potentially detrimental medications should be avoided in the early days poststroke. Patients with stroke who are unable to return home should be referred for evaluation to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Research suggests that a substantial increase in both the dose and intensity of upper and lower extremity exercise is beneficial. A clinical trial supports vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunct to occupational therapy for motor recovery in the upper extremity. The data remain somewhat mixed as to whether robotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation are better than dose-matched traditional exercise. No current drug therapy has been proven to augment exercise poststroke to enhance motor recovery.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists will collaborate with rehabilitation professionals for several months following a patient's stroke. Many questions still remain about the ideal exercise regimen to maximize motor recovery in patients poststroke. The next several years will likely bring a host of new research studies exploring the latest strategies to enhance motor recovery using poststroke exercise.},

Diagnostic criteria for MS have evolved over time, and the latest version facilitates earlier diagnosis of MS in those presenting with typical clinical syndromes. This article summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for MS, typical and atypical presentations of MS, and when diagnostic criteria should be applied with caution.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent version of the MS diagnostic criteria has the benefits of simplicity and greater sensitivity in comparison to previous iterations. However, misdiagnosis remains a significant issue in MS clinical care, even at MS specialty centers. It is, therefore, evident that careful clinical application of the current version of the diagnostic criteria is necessary and that tools improving the diagnostic accuracy of MS would be of substantial clinical utility. Emerging diagnostic biomarkers that may be useful in this regard, including the central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and fluid biomarkers, are discussed.                                         SUMMARY               Current MS diagnostic criteria facilitate the early diagnosis of MS in people presenting with typical clinical syndromes but should be used cautiously in those presenting with atypical syndromes and in special populations. Clinical judgment and existing paraclinical tools, including sequential MRIs of the neuraxis and laboratory tests, are useful in minimizing misdiagnosis and facilitating the accurate diagnosis of MS. Diagnostic biomarkers that may facilitate or refute a diagnosis of MS in these settings, and emerging imaging and fluid biomarkers may eventually become available for use in clinical settings.},

An understanding of the features specific to each type of toxic-metabolic and hereditary optic neuropathy, and of the underlying mechanism of insult to the optic nerve, could lead to earlier recognition, diagnosis, and treatment (when available).                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Understanding of the role of mitochondria in toxic-metabolic and hereditary optic neuropathies is growing, particularly regarding the mechanism of insult of certain agents (medications and toxins) and of vitamin B                 12                 deficiency. New developments in the quest for treatment for hereditary optic neuropathy, specifically Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, are being seen.                                                        SUMMARY               Toxic-metabolic and hereditary optic neuropathies present in a similar fashion, with painless, progressive, bilateral visual loss with dyschromatopsia and cecocentral visual field defects. The associated retinal ganglion cell and axonal loss is typically due to mitochondrial dysfunction caused by an exogenous agent (toxic), by insufficient or deficient substrate (metabolic or nutritional), or by abnormal proteins or mitochondrial structure determined by a genetic mutation (hereditary).},

Despite multiple studies assessing this treatment regime little is known about the mechanism of effect. This lack of understanding may be hindering therapeutic care and preventing optimal rehabilitation. Of the mechanisms proposed, most relate to tendon adaptation and fail to consider other possibilities. The current consensus is that tendon adaptation does not occur within timeframes associated with clinical improvements, therefore the clinical benefits must occur through another unidentified pathway. This clinical commentary critically reviews each of the proposed theories and highlights that muscle alterations are observed prior to onset of Achilles Tendinopathy and during the disease. Evidence shows that the observed muscle alterations change with treatment and that these adaptations have the ability to reduce tendon load and thereby improve tendon health. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to review previous theories regarding the mechanisms by which eccentric exercise might affect Achilles tendinopathy and offers a novel mechanism by which the plantarflexor muscles may shield the Achilles tendon.

The model is based on a kinematic study of nine runners with iliotibial band friction syndrome, a cadaveric study of 11 normal knees, and a literature review. Friction (or impingement) occurs near footstrike, predominantly in the foot contact phase, between the posterior edge of the iliotibial band and the underlying lateral femoral epicondyle. The study subjects had an average knee flexion angle of 21.4 degrees +/- 4.3 degrees at footstrike, with friction occurring at, or slightly below, the 30 degrees of flexion traditionally described in the literature. In the cadavers we examined, there was substantial variation in the width of the iliotibial bands. This variation may affect individual predisposition to iliotibial band friction syndrome. Downhill running predisposes the runner to iliotibial band friction syndrome because the knee flexion angle at footstrike is reduced. Sprinting and faster running on level ground are less likely to cause or aggravate iliotibial band friction syndrome because, at footstrike, the knee is flexed beyond the angles at which friction occurs.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing whether the cause of orthostatic hypotension is a pathologic lesion in sympathetic neurons (ie, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) or secondary to other medical causes (ie, non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) can be achieved by measuring blood pressure and heart rate at the bedside. Whereas fludrocortisone has been extensively used as first-line treatment in the past, it is associated with adverse events including renal and cardiac failure and increased risk of all-cause hospitalization. Distinguishing whether neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is caused by central or peripheral dysfunction has therapeutic implications. Patients with peripheral sympathetic denervation respond better to norepinephrine agonists/precursors such as droxidopa, whereas patients with central autonomic dysfunction respond better to norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.                                         SUMMARY               Management of orthostatic hypotension is aimed at improving quality of life and reducing symptoms rather than at normalizing blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic measures are the key to success. Pharmacologic options include volume expansion with fludrocortisone and sympathetic enhancement with midodrine, droxidopa, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Neurogenic supine hypertension complicates management of orthostatic hypotension and is primarily ameliorated by avoiding the supine position and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated.},

Early in their clinical course, PSP and CBS may be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson disease and several other illnesses, but it is crucial to do so because of implications for management and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early accurate diagnosis of PSP and CBS remains a challenge because of heterogeneity in presenting symptoms and high frequency of coexisting pathologies (especially Alzheimer disease and vascular disease). It is increasingly recognized that patients with PSP, CBS, and other parkinsonian disorders require multidisciplinary care for optimal outcomes. With the recent proliferation of biomarker studies and therapeutic trials for tauopathies, there is growing hope that better treatments for PSP and CBS are on the horizon.

METHODS: A population-based study was performed within Olmstead County Minnesota, from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999. MP incidence and its association with age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and DM were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients with MP, 262 normal controls, and 262 BMI-matched normal controls with mean age of 50 years were identified (51\% men). The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of MP was 32.6 per 100,000 patient years, whereas the incidence of MP in people with DM was 247 per 100,000 patient years, 7 times the occurrence of MP in the general population. Of the patients with MP, 28\% had DM vs 17\% of BMI-matched controls and the majority of people with MP developed DM after the diagnosis of MP. Patients with MP are 2 times more likely to develop DM (odds ratio 2, 95\% confidence interval 1.3-3.0, p = 0.0027). The mean BMI of patients with MP (30.1 kg/m(2), obese class I) was significantly higher than that of age- and gender-matched controls (27.3 kg/m(2), overweight). MP incidence increased 12.9 per 100,000 patient years in the hemidecade study period with an associated increase in both BMI (2.2 kg/m(2)) and average age (3 years). CONCLUSIONS: MP is a frequent painful neuropathy associated with obesity, advancing age, and DM. The incidence rate of MP is predicted to increase as these demographics increase in world populations. Because MP associates with DM beyond weight- and age-matched controls, more aggressive counseling of these patients in prevention of DM may be warranted.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and although restoring striatal dopamine levels may improve symptoms, no treatment can cure or reverse the disease itself. Stem cell therapy has a regenerative effect and is being actively studied as a candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Mesenchymal stem cells are considered a promising option due to fewer ethical concerns, a lower risk of immune rejection, and a lower risk of teratogenicity. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives on motor function, memory, and preservation of dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease animal model. We searched bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles and included only peer-reviewed               in vivo               interventional animal studies published in any language through June 28, 2023. The study utilized the random-effect model to estimate the 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of the standard mean differences (SMD) between the treatment and control groups. We use the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation's risk of bias tool and the collaborative approach to meta-analysis and review of animal studies checklist for study quality assessment. A total of 33 studies with data from 840 Parkinson's disease model animals were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved motor function as assessed by the amphetamine-induced rotational test. Among the stem cell types, the bone marrow MSCs with neurotrophic factor group showed largest effect size (SMD [95\% CI] = {\textendash}6.21 [{\textendash}9.50 to {\textendash}2.93],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 0.0 \%). The stem cell treatment group had significantly more tyrosine hydroxylase positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum ([95\% CI] = 1.04 [0.59 to 1.49],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 65.1 \%) and substantia nigra (SMD [95\% CI] = 1.38 [0.89 to 1.87],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 75.3 \%), indicating a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Subgroup analysis of the amphetamine-induced rotation test showed a significant reduction only in the intracranial-striatum route (SMD [95\% CI] = {\textendash}2.59 [{\textendash}3.25 to {\textendash}1.94],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 74.4 \%). The memory test showed significant improvement only in the intravenous route (SMD [95\% CI] = 4.80 [1.84 to 7.76],               P               = 0.027,               I               2               = 79.6 \%). Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to positively impact motor function and memory function and protect dopaminergic neurons in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required to determine the optimal stem cell types, modifications, transplanted cell numbers, and delivery methods for these protocols.},

  abstract = {The prevention of falls among the elderly is arguably one of the most important public health issues in today's aging society. The aim of this study was to assess which tools best predict the risk of falls in the elderly. Electronic searches were performed using Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, etc., using the following keywords: "fall risk assessment", "elderly fall screening", and "elderly mobility scale". The QUADAS-2 was applied to assess the internal validity of the diagnostic studies. Selected studies were meta-analyzed with MetaDisc 1.4. A total of 33 studies were eligible out of the 2,321 studies retrieved from selected databases. Twenty-six assessment tools for fall risk were used in the selected articles, and they tended to vary based on the setting. The fall risk assessment tools currently used for the elderly did not show sufficiently high predictive validity for differentiating high and low fall risks. The Berg Balance scale and Mobility Interaction Fall chart showed stable and high specificity, while the Downton Fall Risk Index, Hendrich II Fall Risk Model, St. Thomas's Risk Assessment Tool in Falling elderly inpatients, Timed Up and Go test, and Tinetti Balance scale showed the opposite results. We concluded that rather than a single measure, two assessment tools used together would better evaluate the characteristics of falls by the elderly that can occur due to a multitude of factors and maximize the advantages of each for predicting the occurrence of falls.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Pediatric brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of tumors that differ from adult brain cancers despite similar nomenclature. With the added complexity of the developing brain, treatment regimens are tailored to protect neurocognitive outcomes without sacrificing long-term survival. The 2016 World Health Organization's classification incorporated molecular characteristics to aid in defining the diagnosis and prognosis of these tumors. These changes have enabled providers to stratify patients, thus intensifying therapies in those with high-risk diseases and modifying treatments to reduce morbidity for children and to provide better outcomes. Recent published findings from clinical trials have been especially helpful for gliomas, embryonal tumors, and ependymomas. By using this new information, molecular factors that correlate with survival have been identified in patients. In addition, genetic findings in tumor tissue have also led to revelations in predisposing germline mutations.                                         SUMMARY               New findings from clinical trials and molecular stratification will shape the next generation of therapies in hopes of improving overall outcome, identifying pathways in tumorigenesis, and aiding in genetic counseling for children and their families.},

This article provides a diagnostic approach based on clinical history and neurologic examination leading to a narrow set of diagnostic tests.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Numerous discoveries in recent years have facilitated clinician access to more advanced laboratory and genetic testing to pinpoint the exact diagnosis in patients with muscle or neuromuscular junction disorders. Large-scale genetic testing has become much less expensive, and free testing has become available for many of the rare conditions because of increased research and the availability of effective therapies for these rare disorders.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to muscle and neuromuscular junction disorders depends on the clinical pattern of muscle weakness. By classifying patients into one of 10 muscle patterns, diagnostic testing can be targeted and gene testing yield will be optimized. With the increased accessibility and reduced cost of genetic testing (eg, gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, and chromosomal microarray), this clinical approach to muscle weakness and targeted gene testing will ensure a cost-effective investigational plan. This clinical approach should also assist clinicians in making a timely and accurate diagnosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Contrary to popular belief, many congenital CNS infections are preventable and treatable. Treatment options exist for congenital cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis, although the efficacy of these treatments and the populations that may benefit from treatment are variable. Zika virus has recently emerged as a pathogen affecting the fetal brain, and new data suggest that the pathogenesis of Zika virus involves direct infection of neuronal progenitor cells leading to destruction of CNS tissue. The incidence of congenital syphilis has been increasing in the United States over the past decade as a direct result of new syphilis cases among adults and poor access to adequate maternal health care.                                         SUMMARY               Congenital CNS infections often result in significant neurologic morbidity in pediatric patients.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurogenic bladder dysfunction represents one of the most common and devastating sequelae of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). As early prediction of bladder outcomes is essential to counsel patients and to plan neurourological management, we aimed to develop and validate a model to predict urinary continence and complete bladder emptying 1 y after traumatic SCI. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using multivariate logistic regression analysis from the data of 1,250 patients with traumatic SCI included in the European Multicenter Spinal Cord Injury study, we developed two prediction models of urinary continence and complete bladder emptying 1 y after traumatic SCI and performed an external validation in 111 patients. As predictors, we evaluated age, gender, and all variables of the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) and of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM). Urinary continence and complete bladder emptying 1 y after SCI were assessed through item 6 of SCIM. The full model relies on lower extremity motor score (LEMS), light-touch sensation in the S3 dermatome of ISNCSI, and SCIM subscale respiration and sphincter management: the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (aROC) was 0.936 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.922-0.951). The simplified model is based on LEMS only: the aROC was 0.912 (95\% CI: 0.895-0.930). External validation of the full and simplified models confirmed the excellent predictive power: the aROCs were 0.965 (95\% CI: 0.934-0.996) and 0.972 (95\% CI 0.943-0.999), respectively. This study is limited by the substantial number of patients with a missing 1-y outcome and by differences between derivation and validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides two simple and reliable models to predict urinary continence and complete bladder emptying 1 y after traumatic SCI. Early prediction of bladder function might optimize counselling and patient-tailored rehabilitative interventions and improve patient stratification in future clinical trials.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Systemic autoimmune diseases can be associated with a wide spectrum of neurologic comorbidities involving the central and peripheral nervous systems. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be associated with a number of manifestations predominantly affecting the central nervous system (CNS), whereas peripheral neuropathy is less common. Sj{\"o}gren syndrome can be associated with peripheral neuropathy in 10\% of cases and CNS disease in 2\% to 5\% of cases. The risk of stroke is increased in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Systemic vasculitides present most commonly with mononeuritis multiplex but can also affect the CNS. Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, most commonly seen in patients with SLE or Sj{\"o}gren syndrome.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of systemic autoimmune disease are important to recognize, as they may often be the presenting manifestation leading to diagnosis of the systemic disease or may be associated with increased morbidity, other complications, or mortality. Timely diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment, often requiring multidisciplinary care, is essential to minimize morbidity and decrease the risk of permanent neurologic deficits.},

Understanding the presentation of headache in women in relation to hormonal changes both during the menstrual cycle and throughout the life span is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although perimenstrual migraine attacks are generally without aura, the diagnosis of migraine with aura has been added to the headache classification for menstrual migraine to account for women with the diagnosis of migraine with aura who experience menstrual migraine attacks. Emerging knowledge regarding the differences between menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks, the variability of attack triggering within and between women, and the response of women with menstrually related migraine to new migraine drug classes is contributing to better understanding and more effective treatment of these particularly burdensome and refractory attacks. Given the burden of migraine, almost one-fourth of women with migraine avoid or delay pregnancy. Women who experience migraine during pregnancy are more likely to have a hypertensive disorder and stroke during pregnancy and/or delivery and the postpartum period. Treatment of headache in general and migraine in particular in pregnancy is challenging because of fetal and maternal risks; however, a 2021 systematic review suggests that triptans and low-dose aspirin may not be associated with fetal/child adverse effects and could be more strongly considered for headache treatment in pregnancy.                                         SUMMARY               Headache in general and migraine in particular are extraordinarily common in women of reproductive age and fluctuate with hormonal changes and phases of life. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and response to treatment of perimenstrual attacks is essential for more effective response to this most burdensome headache type.

RECENT FINDINGS                                The 2018 Neurosarcoidosis Consortium diagnostic criteria emphasize that biopsy is key for diagnosis and determines the level of diagnostic certainty. Thus,                 definite neurosarcoidosis                 requires nervous system biopsy and                 probable neurosarcoidosis                 requires biopsy from extraneural tissue. Without biopsy,                 possible neurosarcoidosis                 can be diagnosed if the clinical, imaging, and laboratory picture is compatible and other causes are ruled out. Recent large retrospective studies from the United States and France established that infliximab appears to be efficacious when other treatments are inadequate.                                                        SUMMARY                                Sarcoidosis is a multisystem noninfectious granulomatous disorder that is immune mediated, reflecting the response to an as-yet unidentified antigen or antigens. Neurosarcoidosis refers to neurologic involvement due to sarcoidosis that clinically manifests in 5\% of cases of sarcoidosis, with asymptomatic involvement in as many as another one in five patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoid granulomas can occur in any anatomic substrate in the nervous system, causing protean manifestations that have earned neurosarcoidosis the sobriquet                 the great mimic                 . Nevertheless, central nervous system sarcoidosis occurs in well-defined presentations that can be classified as cranial neuropathies, meningeal disease, brain parenchymal (including pituitary-hypothalamic) disease, and spinal cord disease. In addition, the peripheral nervous system is affected in the form of peripheral neuropathy and myopathy. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment, especially in the acute stage, whereas steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine are used for prolonged therapy to minimize steroid toxicity. Anti{\textendash}tumor necrosis factor agents may help in refractory cases.},

SUMMARY               The clinical spectrum of pediatric movement disorders is broad and heterogeneous, ranging from acute or transient self-limited conditions to conditions that cause profound lifelong motor disability. Most movement disorders in childhood are chronic, and the large number of rare, genetic conditions associated with pediatric movement disorders can pose a significant diagnostic challenge. Recognition of distinctive diagnostic clues in the history and examination can facilitate the diagnosis of potentially treatable disorders.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are often associated with aural manifestations. However, it is not clear whether aural fullness could be induced by TMD. The purpose was to investigate the TMD and effectiveness of TMD treatments in patients with mainly or exclusively aural fullness complaint. METHODS: One hundred and twelve patients, who had aural fullness as the main or sole complaint, presented to the Otolaryngology Department, PLA Army General Hospital, Beijing, China, between January 2010 and January 2015. Patients' medical history indicated that they had previously been diagnosed and treated for otitis media or sensorineural hearing loss but without positive results. Patients were subjected to pure tone audiometry and acoustic immittance screening using GSI-61 clinical audiometer and GSI TympStar middle ear analyzer respectively. Patients were examined by questionnaire, X-ray and/or computed tomography scan of temporomandibular joint. TMD was categorized according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Patients were then treated for TMD. RESULTS: All the patients showed normal eardrum and type A tympanogram. The patients of 60.7\% (68/112) were classified as group I TMD disorders (muscle disorders), 34.8\% (39/112) were group II (disc displacements), and 4.5\% (5/112) were group III (arthralgia, osteoarthritis, and osteoarthrosis). Aural fullness was completely resolved or significantly improved in 67 and 34 patients respectively following treatments aimed at improving TMD, with a combined effectiveness of 90.2\% (101/112). TMD treatments are especially effective (94.1\%) in group I TMD. CONCLUSION: TMD as a potential cause of aural fullness should be considered in otolaryngology practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevation of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF frequently occurs during active and acute CNS inflammatory processes and presumably is associated with B cell-related immune activation. Elevation levels, however, vary a lot and "leaking" of CXCL13 from blood across dysfunctional brain barriers is a possible source. The aim was to clarify the relation between CXCL13 concentrations in CSF, CXCL13 concentrations in serum and blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) function for a correct interpretation of the intrathecal origin of CXCL13. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed CXCL13 of banked CSF/serum samples (n\,=\,69) selected from patient records and categorized the CSF CXCL13 elevations as CXCL13 negative ({$<$}\,30~pg/ml), low (30-100~pg/ml), medium (101-250~pg/ml), or high ({$>$}\,250~pg/ml). CXCL13 concentrations in CSF and serum and the corresponding CSF/serum CXCL13 quotients (Qcxcl13) were compared to CSF/serum albumin quotients (QAlb) as a measure for BCSFB function. The CXCL13 negative category included two subgroups with normal and dysfunctional BCSFB. RESULTS: Serum CXCL13 concentrations were similar across categories with median levels around 100~pg/ml but differed between individuals (29 to {$>$}\,505~pg/ml). Despite clear evidence in serum, CXCL13 was detectable only at trace amounts (medians 3.5 and 7.5~pg/ml) in CSF of the two CXCL13 negative subgroups irrespective of a normal or pathological QAlb. Moreover, we found no association between CSF and serum CXCL13 levels or between QAlb and CSF CXCL13 levels in any of the CSF CXCL13-delineated categories. CXCL13 apparently does not "leak" from blood into CSF. This implies an intrathecal origin also for low CSF CXCL13 levels and a caveat for analyzing the Qcxcl13, because higher serum than CSF concentrations arithmetically depress the Qcxcl13 resulting in misleadingly low CSF/serum quotients. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CXCL13 does not cross from blood into CSF, not even during severe BCSFB dysfunction. CSF CXCL13 elevations therefore most likely always are CNS-derived, which highlights their relevance as indicator of inflammatory CNS processes. We recommend data should not be corrected for BCSFB permeability (QAlb) and not to calculate CSF/serum quotients for CXCL13 as these may introduce error.},

This article describes the most common respiratory viruses that have neurologic manifestations, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               In vitro and in vivo studies have better elucidated the neurotropism of various respiratory viruses. Understanding host cell receptors that mediate viral binding and entry not only demonstrates how viruses enter host cells but also provides possible mechanisms for therapeutic interventions. Elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 binding and fusion with host cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor may also provide greater insights into its systemic and neurologic sequelae. Respiratory virus neurotropism and collateral injury due to concurrent inflammatory cascades result in various neurologic pathologies, including Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and seizures.                                         SUMMARY               Numerous respiratory viruses can infect the cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems, elicit inflammatory cascades, and directly and indirectly cause various neurologic manifestations. Patients with neurologic manifestations from respiratory viruses are often critically ill and require mechanical ventilation. Neurologists and neurointensivists should be familiar with the common neurologic manifestations of respiratory viruses and the unique and still-evolving sequelae associated with COVID-19.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is strongly linked with obesity and patients with osteoporosis (OP) have a low body mass index. Anecdotal evidence, clinical and laboratory, suggests that OA bone contains more fat. However, conversion of osteoblasts to adipocytes is reported in OP and this would suggest that the more porous OP cancellous bone would have a high fat content. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that OA bone contains more fat than OP bone. METHODS: Cores of cancellous bone were obtained from femoral heads of patients undergoing surgery for either OA or OP. Lipids were extracted using chloroform-methanol, weighed and expressed as a fraction of core mass and volume. A fatty acid analysis was performed using gas chromatography. RESULTS: OA bone contained twice as much fat per unit volume of tissue as OP. Levels of n-6 fatty acids were elevated in OA, especially arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) which was almost double that found in OP. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that lipids may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of OA and may provide part of the key to understanding why OA and OP lie at opposite ends of the spectrum of bone masses.},

Objectives To characterize the prevalence of scapular dyskinesis in participants with and without shoulder pain, and to determine the influence of blinding to the presence of shoulder pain on prevalence of scapular dyskinesis. Methods Participants (n = 135), 67 with shoulder pain and 68 healthy controls, were included in this study. The SDT was performed by 2 examiners, from a total of 21 physical therapists. The second examiner was blinded to the participant's presence of shoulder pain. The SDT involved participants performing 5 repetitions of shoulder flexion and abduction, while the clinician observed for scapular dyskinesis, as characterized by scapular winging or dysrhythmia. Dyskinesis was rated as normal, subtle, or obvious. Ratings were collapsed into 2 groups, dyskinesis (subtle and obvious) and no dyskinesis (normal), as recommended by expert consensus. Results There were no significant differences for scapular dyskinesis prevalence between the shoulder pain group and control group during the SDT in abduction (shoulder pain, 67.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 52.9\%; 95\% CI: 0.41, 0.64; P = .09) or flexion (shoulder pain, 67.2\%; 95\% CI: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 61.8\%; 95\% CI: 0.50, 0.72; P = .51).

The unblinded examiner reported a higher prevalence when testing the involved shoulder for dyskinesis in flexion (blinded, 67.7\%; 95\% CI: 0.56, 0.78 and unblinded, 80\%; 95\% CI: 0.69, 0.88) and during abduction (blinded, 66.2\%; 95\% CI: 0.54, 0.76 and unblinded, 78.5\%; 95\% CI: 0.67, 0.87). Conclusion Scapular dyskinesis as assessed with the SDT is not more prevalent in those with shoulder pain. Rating was influenced by an examiner's knowledge of shoulder pain presence. Scapular dyskinesis may represent normal movement variability. Level of Evidence Diagnosis, level 4. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(8):530-537. Epub 6 Jul 2017. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.7268.},

  abstract = {Background               . The effect of thermal stress on the physiological parameters of young overweight and sedentary men who sporadically use the sauna remains insufficiently investigated.               Aim               . The aim of the study was to determine the effect of sauna bathing on the physiological parameters of young overweight, physically inactive men and to test the correlations between physiological parameters versus anthropometric features and body composition parameters.               Materials and Methods               . Forty-five overweight and sedentary men aged 20.76{$\pm$}2.4 y were exposed to four sauna sessions of 10 minutes each (temperature: 90-91{\textdegree}C; relative humidity: 14-16 \%) with four 5-minute cool-down breaks. Body composition was determined before sauna, and body mass and blood pressure were measured before and after sauna. Physiological parameters were monitored during four 10-minute sauna sessions.               Results               . A significant (p{$<$}0.0001) increase in all analyzed physiological parameters was observed during four successive 10-minute sauna sessions. Heart rate, energy expenditure, blood pressure, and body mass loss were most strongly correlated with anthropometric parameters (body mass, body mass index, and body surface area) and body composition parameters (percent body fat, body fat mass, and visceral fat level). The 60-minute treatment resulted in a significant reduction in body mass (0.65 kg).               Conclusions               . Repeated use of Finnish sauna induces significant changes in the physiological parameters of young sedentary overweight men, and these changes are intensified during successive treatments. Deleterious cardiovascular adaptations were most prevalent in men characterized by the highest degree of obesity and the largest body size.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Significant advances are being made in the recognition and characterization of the syndromically diverse AD variants. These variants are identified by the predominant cognitive and clinical features: early-onset amnestic syndrome, aphasia, visuospatial impairments, dysexecutive and behavioral disturbance, or motor symptoms. Although understanding of regional susceptibility to disease remains in its infancy, visualizing amyloid and tau pathology in vivo and CSF examination of amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau proteins are particularly useful in atypical AD, which can be otherwise prone to misdiagnosis. Large-scale research efforts, such as LEADS (the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease Study), are currently ongoing and will continue to shed light on our understanding of these diverse presentations.                                         SUMMARY               Understanding the clinical, neuroimaging, and biomarker profiles of the heterogeneous group of atypical AD syndromes improves diagnostic accuracy in patients who are at increased risk of misdiagnosis.

This review summarizes potential neurologic complications in patients who have undergone treatment for neurologic and systemic malignancies.                                         Latest Developments               Radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy along with other targeted therapies continue to be the mainstay of cancer treatment. These advances in cancer care have led to improved outcomes and increased the need to understand the spectrum of neurologic complications that may arise from treatment. While radiation and older therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapies have side effect profiles that are widely known and well understood, this article serves as a review of the more commonly associated neurologic complications of both traditional and newer treatments being offered to this patient population.                                         Essential Points               Neurotoxicity is a common complication of cancer-directed treatment. In general, neurologic complications of radiation therapy are more common in central nervous system malignancies, and neurologic complications of chemotherapy are more common in non-neurologic malignancies. Attempts at prevention, early detection, and intervention remain paramount in the reduction of neurologic morbidity.},

For each disorder, a historical perspective is offered and relevant neuroscientific studies are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Careful analysis of the consequences of lesions that disrupt visual functions such as facial recognition and written language processing has improved understanding of the role of key regions in these networks. In addition, modern imaging techniques have built upon prior lesion studies to further elucidate the functions of these cortical areas. For example, functional MRI (fMRI) has identified and characterized the response properties of ventral regions that contribute to object recognition and dorsal regions that subserve motion perception and visuospatial attention. Newer network-based functional imaging studies have shed light on the mechanisms behind various causes of spontaneous visual hallucinations.

It provides a clinical approach to the most commonly affected patient groups based on clinicoanatomic presentation and disease-specific risks resulting from immune deficits and drugs received.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The clinical presentations, associated neuroimaging findings, and CSF abnormalities of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompromised may differ from those of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompetent and may be confused with noninfectious processes. Triggering of brain autoimmunity with emergence of neurotropic antibodies has emerged as a recognized parainfectious complication. New unbiased metagenomic assays to identify obscure pathogens help clinicians navigate the increasing range of conditions affecting the growing population of patients with altered immunity.                                         SUMMARY               Despite evidence-based prophylactic regimens and organism-specific antimicrobials, central nervous system infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in an increasing range of patients who are immunocompromised by their conditions and therapies. Multiple new drugs put patients at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which has numerous imaging and clinical manifestations; patients at risk include those with multiple sclerosis, for whom infection risk is becoming one of the most important factors in therapeutic decision making.

RECENT FINDINGS               The incidence of ischemic stroke in young adults has been increasing since the 1980s, which has occurred in parallel with increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors and substance abuse among the younger population. Young adults have a considerably wider range of risk factors than older patients, including age-specific factors such as pregnancy/puerperium and oral contraceptive use. Behavioral risk factors such as low physical activity, excess alcohol consumption, and smoking are factors as well. More than 150 identified causes of early-onset ischemic stroke exist, including rare monogenic disorders. Several recent advances have been made in diagnosis and management of stroke in young adults, including molecular characterization of monogenic vasculitis due to deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 and transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale for secondary prevention. Compared with the background population of the same age and sex, long-term mortality in patients remains fourfold higher with cardiovascular causes underlying most of the deaths. The cumulative rate of recurrent stroke extends up to 15\% at 10 years. Patients with atherosclerosis, high-risk sources of cardioembolism, and small vessel disease underlying their stroke seem to have the worst prognosis regarding survival and recurrent vascular events. Young stroke survivors also often have other adverse outcomes in the long term, including epilepsy, pain, cognitive problems, and depression.                                         SUMMARY               Systematic identification of risk factors and causes and the motivation of patients for long-term prevention and lifestyle changes are of utmost importance to improve the prognosis of early-onset ischemic stroke.},

This article describes the epidemiology, genetic and environmental risk factors, clinical diagnosis, biomarkers, and treatment of late-onset AD, defined by age of onset of 65 years or older.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with AD dementia, with the number of affected individuals growing rapidly because of an aging population. Vascular risk factors, sleep disorders, and traumatic brain injury are associated with an increased risk of AD, while increased cognitive and physical activity throughout the lifespan reduce the risk of disease. The primary genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the apolipoprotein E (                 APOE                 ) {$\epsilon$}4 allele. AD typically presents with early and prominent episodic memory loss, although this clinical syndrome is neither sensitive nor specific for underlying AD neuropathology. Emerging CSF and imaging biomarkers can now detect the key neuropathologic features of the disease (amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration) in living people, allowing for characterization of patients based on biological measures. A comprehensive treatment plan for AD includes use of symptomatic medications, optimal treatment of comorbid conditions and neuropsychiatric symptoms, counseling about safety and future planning, and referrals to community resources.                                                        SUMMARY               AD is very common in older neurologic patients. Neurologists should set the standard for the diagnosis and care of patients with AD and should be familiar with emerging biomarkers that have transformed AD research and are primed to enter the clinical arena.},

This article reviews basic pathophysiologic concepts regarding autonomic hyperactivity, its various forms of clinical presentation, and practical management considerations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is most common after traumatic brain injury but can also occur after other forms of severe acute diffuse or multifocal brain injury. Formal criteria for the diagnosis and severity grading of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity have now been proposed. A growing body of literature is beginning to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this disorder, but treatment remains based on observational data. Our mechanistic understanding of other distinct forms of autonomic hyperactivity, such as autonomic dysreflexia after traumatic spinal cord injury and dysautonomia after Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, remains rudimentary, yet clinical experience shows that their appropriate management can minimize the risk of serious complications.

RECENT FINDINGS               Immobilization of the spine and spine clearance should be individualized depending on the ability to perform a reliable neurologic examination, the presence of neck pain, and the imaging findings. Early surgery (within 24 hours) to achieve definitive cord decompression and spine stabilization may be beneficial. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and perfusion and avoiding secondary systemic complications remain the goals of the critical care of these patients. No neuroprotective treatment has been shown to improve outcomes. In fact, the use of high-dose methylprednisolone is now generally discouraged because of its major systemic adverse effects. Survivors of severe cervical traumatic spinal cord injury typically sustain substantial long-term functional impairment. Advances in our understanding of neuroregenerative strategies, especially stem cell transplantation, can offer the future hope of functional improvement to the many patients currently living with the consequences of traumatic spinal cord injury. Yet, at present, these therapies remain strictly investigational.

Recent Findings:               The results of several randomized controlled trials consistently and conclusively demonstrating that previously functional patients with disabling strokes from a proximal intracranial artery occlusion benefit from prompt recanalization with mechanical thrombectomy using a retrievable stent have changed the landscape of acute stroke therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of symptom onset should now be considered the preferred treatment for these patients along with IV thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within the first 4.5 hours for all patients who do not have contraindications for systemic thrombolysis. Patients who are ineligible for IV rtPA can also benefit from mechanical thrombectomy. Collateral status and time to reperfusion are the main determinants of outcome.                                         Summary:               Timely successful reperfusion is the most effective treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Systems of care should be optimized to maximize the number of patients with acute ischemic stroke able to receive reperfusion therapy.},

ABSTRACT               PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article provides an update on the state of the art of the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with particular emphasis on the indications for reperfusion therapy.               RECENT FINDINGS               In addition to the previously established indications for intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset and endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy for patients with large artery occlusion who can be treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, recent randomized controlled trials have now established new indications for emergency reperfusion in patients with wake-up stroke or delayed presentation (up to 24 hours from last known well in the case of mechanical thrombectomy). Identification of patients who may benefit from acute reperfusion therapy within this extended time window requires screening with perfusion brain imaging or, in the case of IV thrombolysis for wake-up strokes, emergency brain MRI. Collateral status and time to reperfusion remain the primary determinants of outcome.               SUMMARY               Timely successful reperfusion is the most effective treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke.

RECENT FINDINGS               Therapy for LEMS has seen significant advances in recent years due to the approval of amifampridine-based compounds. LEMS is likely still underdiagnosed, particularly when no underlying malignancy is identified. Clinicians must have a strong suspicion for LEMS in any patient presenting with proximal weakness and autonomic dysfunction. Botulism is another rare disorder of presynaptic neuromuscular transmission that is most commonly associated with improper storage or preservation of food products. Over the past 2 decades, wound botulism has been increasingly reported among users of black tar heroin. A high degree of clinical suspicion and electrodiagnostic studies can be beneficial in distinguishing botulism from other acute neurologic disorders, and early involvement of state and federal health authorities may assist in confirming the diagnosis and obtaining treatment. When botulism is suspected, electrodiagnostic studies can provide clinical evidence of disordered neuromuscular transmission in advance of serologic confirmation, and providers should not wait for confirmation of the diagnosis to initiate treatment.                                         SUMMARY               A targeted clinical history and a thorough neurologic examination with support from serologic and electrodiagnostic studies are key to early diagnosis of LEMS and botulism. Early diagnosis of both conditions creates opportunities for therapy and improves outcomes.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although the historical use of MRI in dementia diagnosis has been supportive to exclude structural etiologies, recent innovations allow for quantification of atrophy patterns that improve sensitivity for supporting the diagnosis of dementia causes. Neuronuclear approaches allow for localization of specific amyloid and tau neuropathology on PET and are available for clinical use, in addition to dopamine transporter scans in dementia with Lewy bodies and metabolic studies with fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET).                                         SUMMARY               Using computerized software programs for MRI analysis and cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations of hippocampal, ventricular, and lobar volumes improves sensitivity in support of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. MRI protocol requirements for such quantification are three-dimensional T1-weighted volumetric imaging protocols, which may need to be specifically requested. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3.0T susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences are useful for the detection of white matter hyperintensities as well as microhemorrhages in vascular dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. PET studies for amyloid and/or tau pathology can add additional specificity to the diagnosis but currently remain largely inaccessible outside of research settings because of prohibitive cost constraints in most of the world. Dopamine transporter PET scans can help identify Lewy body dementia and are thus of potential clinical value.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and stabilization exercises in an attempt to prevent fatigue and improve muscle activation in patients with lumbar disk herniation associated with low back pain. METHODS: This study involved 29 patients (age range 25-58 years) randomized into 2 groups: the segmental stabilization group (n = 15), who received stabilization exercises on the transversus abdominis (TrA) and lumbar multifidus muscles; and the TENS group (n = 14), who received electrotherapy. Groups underwent 16 sessions, for 60 minutes, twice per week, and they were evaluated before and after intervention. Pain was measured using a visual analog scale, functional disability using the Oswestry Disability Index, muscle activation and fatigue with electromyography, and patients' ability to contract the TrA with a pressure biofeedback unit. Analyses within and between groups were performed. RESULTS: The stabilization group improved lumbar multifidus fatigue (median frequency [MF] initial [P = .002], MF final [P {$<$} .001], MF slope [P = .001], and resistance time [P {$<$} .001]), ability to contract the TrA (P {$<$} .001), pain (P {$<$} .001), and functional disability (P {$<$} .001). TENS only was effective for pain (P = .012). CONCLUSION: Although it relieved pain, TENS was not effective as a single treatment to prevent fatigue, increase TrA contraction, and reduce functional disability in herniated disk patients. Stabilization exercises alone improved all measured outcomes.},

A couple of studies in adult men observed a negative correlation between genistein exposure and reproductive parameters. To assess the effects of genistein exposure on reproduction and fertility in males and females, we performed quantitative meta-analyses by pooling data from published studies on animals that assessed various reproductive parameters. Pooled analysis showed significant decreases in sperm count in males exposed to genistein during adulthood (Hedges's g~=~-2.51, p =\,0.013) and in utero (Hedges's g~=~-0.861, p =\,0.016) compared with controls. In males exposed to genistein in utero, serum testosterone levels decreased (Hedges's g~=~-6.301, p =\,0.000) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (Hedges's g~=~7.127, p =\,0.000) and FSH (Hedges's g~=~6.19, p =\,0.000) levels increased in comparison with controls. In females, the number of corpora lutea (Hedges's g~=~-2.103, p =\,0.019) and the litter size (Hedges's g~=~-1.773, p-value~=~0.000) decreased; however, female reproductive hormones remained unaffected. These meta-analyses show that genistein has detrimental effects on male reproductive system and on the progression and sustenance of pregnancy, with more pronounced adverse impact in males, particularly when exposed in utero.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent functional neuroimaging studies focusing on the nonpainful symptoms of migraine have identified key areas of the central nervous system implicated in the early phases of a migraine attack. Clinical studies of spontaneous and provoked migraine attacks, together with preclinical studies using translational animal models, have led to a better understanding of the disease and the development of disease-specific and targeted therapies.                                         SUMMARY               Our knowledge of the pathophysiology of migraine has advanced significantly in the past decades. Current evidence supports our understanding of migraine as a complex cyclical brain disorder that likely results from dysfunctional sensory processing and dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms.

Recognition and management of Bell's palsy relies on knowledge of the anatomy and function of the various motor and nonmotor components of the facial nerve. Avoiding diagnostic pitfalls relies on recognizing red flags or features atypical for Bell's palsy, suggesting an alternative cause of peripheral facial palsy.                                         Recent Findings:               The first American Academy of Neurology (AAN) evidence-based review on the treatment of Bell's palsy in 2001 concluded that corticosteroids were probably effective and that the antiviral acyclovir was possibly effective in increasing the likelihood of a complete recovery from Bell's palsy. Subsequent studies led to a revision of these recommendations in the 2012 evidence-based review, concluding that corticosteroids, when used shortly after the onset of Bell's palsy, were ``highly likely'' to increase the probability of recovery of facial weakness and should be offered; the addition of an antiviral to steroids may increase the likelihood of recovery but, if so, only by a very modest effect.                                         Summary:               Bell's palsy is characterized by the spontaneous acute onset of unilateral peripheral facial paresis or palsy in isolation, meaning that no features from the history, neurologic examination, or head and neck examination suggest a specific or alternative cause. In this setting, no further testing is necessary. Even without treatment, the outcome of Bell's palsy is favorable, but treatment with corticosteroids significantly increases the likelihood of improvement.},

Several investigators have sought to quantify the biomechanics and electromyographic data of common rehabilitation exercises in an attempt to fully understand their clinical indications and usefulness. Furthermore, the effect of pathology on normal shoulder biomechanics has been documented. It is important to consider the anatomical, biomechanical, and clinical implications when designing exercise programs. The purpose of this paper is to provide the clinician with a thorough overview of the availableliterature relevant to develop safe, effective, and appropriate exercise programs for injury rehabilitation and prevention of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints.

  abstract = {Previously published results showed that both in vitro and in vivo coconut oil (CNO) treatments prevented combing damage of various hair types. Using the same methodology, an attempt was made to study the properties of mineral oil and sunflower oil on hair. Mineral oil (MO) was selected because it is extensively used in hair oil formulations in India, because it is non-greasy in nature, and because it is cheaper than vegetable oils like coconut and sunflower oils. The study was extended to sunflower oil (SFO) because it is the second most utilized base oil in the hair oil industry on account of its non-freezing property and its odorlessness at ambient temperature. As the aim was to cover different treatments, and the effect of these treatments on various hair types using the above oils, the number of experiments to be conducted was a very high number and a technique termed as the Taguchi Design of Experimentation was used. The findings clearly indicate the strong impact that coconut oil application has to hair as compared to application of both sunflower and mineral oils. Among three oils, coconut oil was the only oil found to reduce the protein loss remarkably for both undamaged and damaged hair when used as a pre-wash and post-wash grooming product. Both sunflower and mineral oils do not help at all in reducing the protein loss from hair. This difference in results could arise from the composition of each of these oils. Coconut oil, being a triglyceride of lauric acid (principal fatty acid), has a high affinity for hair proteins and, because of its low molecular weight and straight linear chain, is able to penetrate inside the hair shaft. Mineral oil, being a hydrocarbon, has no affinity for proteins and therefore is not able to penetrate and yield better results. In the case of sunflower oil, although it is a triglyceride of linoleic acid, because of its bulky structure due to the presence of double bonds, it does not penetrate the fiber, consequently resulting in no favorable impact on protein loss.},

RECENT FINDINGS               With a lifetime prevalence estimated at 2.5\%, OCD is a common condition that can also present comorbidly with neurologic disease. The core symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive repetitive thoughts, urges, images, or impulses that trigger anxiety and that the individual is not able to suppress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts occurring in response to an obsession with the intention of reducing the distress caused by obsessions. Neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and pharmacologic studies suggest that the expression of OCD symptoms is associated with dysfunction in a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit. Evidence-based treatments for OCD comprise pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line drugs recommended for OCD, but significant differences exist in their use for OCD compared to their use for other mood and anxiety conditions, including the need for higher dosage, longer trials necessitated by a longer lag for therapeutic response, and typically lower response rates. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, based on the principles of exposure and response prevention, shows results superior to pharmacologic treatments with lower relapse rates on long-term follow-up and thus should be considered in the treatment plan of every patient with OCD.                                         SUMMARY               OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are frequently encountered in the neurologic clinic setting and require a high index of suspicion to effectively screen for them and an illness-specific therapeutic approach.},

An emphasis was placed on defining pertinent nomenclature based on the original references. DATA SYNTHESIS: Afferent proprioceptive input is conveyed to all levels of the central nervous system. They serve fundamental roles in optimal motor control and sensorimotor control over functional joint stability. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATIONS: Sensorimotor control over the dynamic restraints is a complex process that involves components traditionally associated with motor control.

  abstract = {Tendinopathy can be resistant to treatment and often recurs, implying that current treatment approaches are suboptimal. Rehabilitation programmes that have been successful in terms of pain reduction and return to sport outcomes usually include strength training. Muscle activation can induce analgesia, improving self-efficacy associated with reducing one's own pain. Furthermore, strength training is beneficial for tendon matrix structure, muscle properties and limb biomechanics. However, current tendon rehabilitation may not adequately address the corticospinal control of the muscle, which may result in altered control of muscle recruitment and the consequent tendon load, and this may contribute to recalcitrance or symptom recurrence. Outcomes of interest include the effect of strength training on tendon pain, corticospinal excitability and short interval cortical inhibition. The aims of this concept paper are to: (1) review what is known about changes to the primary motor cortex and motor control in tendinopathy, (2) identify the parameters shown to induce neuroplasticity in strength training and (3) align these principles with tendon rehabilitation loading protocols to introduce a combination approach termed as tendon neuroplastic training. Strength training is a powerful modulator of the central nervous system. In particular, corticospinal inputs are essential for motor unit recruitment and activation; however, specific strength training parameters are important for neuroplasticity. Strength training that is externally paced and akin to a skilled movement task has been shown to not only reduce tendon pain, but modulate excitatory and inhibitory control of the muscle and therefore, potentially tendon load. An improved understanding of the methods that maximise the opportunity for neuroplasticity may be an important progression in how we prescribe exercise-based rehabilitation in tendinopathy for pain modulation and potentially restoration of the corticospinal control of the muscle-tendon complex.},

This article reviews the importance of proper diagnosis, natural history, and management of headache disorders in pregnant and postpartum women.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Red flags for secondary headache specifically among pregnant women include elevated blood pressure and lack of a previous headache history, as well as a prolonged duration of the headache attack in those with a prior history of migraine. Migraine improvement is typical for most pregnant women, but the prognosis for women who have migraine with aura or chronic migraine is less predictable. Migraine is now an established risk factor for the development of preeclampsia. Recent data suggest hazards for compounds containing butalbital and possibly a better safety profile for triptans than previously believed during pregnancy. Peripheral nerve blocks and noninvasive neurostimulation devices are procedural and emerging therapies that have promising safety profiles for pregnant women with headache disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Acute headache occurring in pregnancy and the postpartum period is a red flag requiring diagnostic vigilance. Migraine frequency in women typically improves during pregnancy, although this trend is less certain when aura is present and after delivery. Acute and preventive treatment plans during pregnancy and lactation are plausible but may require shifts in therapeutic hierarchy. Relatively safe oral, parenteral, and procedural therapies are available for pregnant women. Noninvasive neuromodulation devices are already available and will likely play a greater role in the coming years. Migraine is associated with medical and obstetrical complications during pregnancy, and women with frequent migraine attacks may need to be considered high risk.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Most cases of trigeminal neuralgia are related to vascular compression, a demyelinating plaque, or a compressive mass affecting the trigeminal nerve. However, recent studies have shown that up to 11\% of patients have a family history of trigeminal neuralgia, suggesting that some patients may have a genetic predisposition to demyelination or nerve hyperexcitability. In these patients, trigeminal neuralgia may occur at a younger age, on both sides of the face, or in combination with other neuralgias.                                         SUMMARY               When a patient presents with neuralgic pain, the diagnosis is made by careful history and neurologic examination, with attention to the dermatome involved, the triggers, and the presence of any associated sensory deficit. All patients with new neuralgia or neuropathic facial pain warrant a careful evaluation for a secondary cause.

In one study, 21 physically active men strength trained for 12 weeks (2 days per week), with either 10 min of CWI or active recovery (ACT) after each training session. Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the CWI group (P {$<$} 0.05). Isokinetic work (19\%), type II muscle fibre cross-sectional area (17\%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26\%) increased in the ACT group (all P {$<$} 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine active men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, followed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (10-30\%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50\%) increased 24-48 h after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h after exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers were greater after ACT than after CWI (P {$<$} 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was greater after ACT (P {$<$} 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute changes in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle hypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy.

Physical examination for the assessment of the ACL is commonly used in routine care in the evaluation of the knee and is part of the diagnostic process. Due to the high degree of variability in their presentation and outcomes, treatment must be tailored according to factors such as patient demographics, the severity of the damage, and long-term improvement profile. When it comes to ACL injuries, low-quality data have been produced that reveals no difference in patient-reported knee function results between surgical ACL restoration and conservative therapy. However, these results must be evaluated in the perspective of the fact that many individuals with an ACL rupture remained symptomatic after rehabilitation and eventually underwent ACL reconstruction surgery.

He had exhibited clinical and radiographic signs of paranasal sinusitis. Before his physiotherapy, the patient received standard treatment with natural and synthetic antibiotics and steroids. After acute signs of infection resolved without any functional improvement, the patient was referred to a rehabilitation unit to undergo neuromuscular re-education of the paralyzed extraocular muscles. Periorbital hydrocortisone iontophoresis and visuomotor exercises with intense ideomotor stimulation led to complete and rapid resolution of extraocular muscle paralysis and diplopia. Physiotherapy can be an effective treatment of choice after failed pharmacological treatment in patients with damage to cranial nerves III and VI. It has many theoretical advantages, including noninvasiveness and avoidance of first-pass metabolism of drugs administered systemically.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease were published in 2020 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Rheumatology.                                         SUMMARY               The most common neurologic complications of Lyme disease are cranial neuritis (most often a unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy), meningitis, and radiculoneuritis/mononeuropathy multiplex. Testing for Lyme disease begins with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the ELISA is positive or borderline, Western blots should be performed for both IgM and IgG antibodies. As a general rule, in infectious diseases, an IgM antibody response is followed by an IgG antibody response. A central nervous system infection has either a CSF pleocytosis or pathogen-specific intrathecal antibody production. Lyme meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or other peripheral nervous system manifestations are treated with oral doxycycline or IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G. No additional antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome or patients with concern for chronic Lyme disease with no evidence of previous or current Lyme infection.},

The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from paraneoplastic syndromes that progress quite rapidly to unidentified genetic disorders that progress slowly over the course of decades. This article highlights the diagnostic process, including the differential diagnosis, as well as treatment approaches and symptomatic management. The pillars of treatment are physical, occupational, and speech therapy as well as counseling and discussions of disease prognosis, genetics, and reproductive choices. There are many ways to help patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and improve their quality of life.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent years have seen significant improvements in genetic testing, with reductions in cost of both Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing and increasing availability of the latter. These improvements increase clinicians' ability to identify the etiology of neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and suggest future treatments. Although no medication has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of cerebellar ataxia, research and clinical trials for these diseases are increasing.                                         SUMMARY               Neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia is characterized by dysarthria, dysmetria, oculomotor abnormalities, and ataxic gait. It has a broad differential diagnosis, and numerous options exist for managing symptoms. Although no medications have been approved specifically for cerebellar ataxia, treatment options are available to improve patients' quality of life.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Initial screening EEG has been validated as a tool to predict which patients are at risk of future seizures. However, accepted definitions of seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus encourage a treatment trial when the diagnosis on EEG is indeterminate because of periodic or rhythmic patterns or uncertain clinical correlation. Similarly, recent data have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of intracranial EEG in increasing the yield of seizure detection. EEG has additionally been validated as a diagnostic biomarker of covert consciousness, a predictive biomarker of cerebral ischemia and impending neurologic deterioration, and a prognostic biomarker of coma recovery and status epilepticus resolution. A recent randomized trial concluded that patients allocated to continuous EEG had no difference in mortality than those undergoing intermittent EEG but could not demonstrate whether this lack of difference was because of studying heterogeneous conditions, examining a monitoring tool rather than a therapeutic approach, or examining an outcome measure (mortality) perhaps more strongly associated with early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy than to a sustained response to pharmacotherapy.                                         SUMMARY               Seizures and status epilepticus are events of synchronous hypermetabolic activity that are either discrete and intermittent or, alternatively, continuous. Seizures and status epilepticus represent the far end of a continuum of ictal-interictal patterns that include lateralized rhythmic delta activity and periodic discharges, which not only predict future seizures but may be further classified as status epilepticus on the basis of intracranial EEG monitoring or a diagnostic trial of antiseizure medication therapy. In particularly challenging cases, neuroimaging or multimodality neuromonitoring may be a useful adjunct documenting metabolic crisis. Specialized uses of EEG as a prognostic biomarker have emerged in traumatic brain injury for predicting language function and covert consciousness, cardiac arrest for predicting coma recovery, and subarachnoid hemorrhage for predicting neurologic deterioration due to delayed cerebral ischemia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Placebo and nocebo effects embody psychoneurobiological phenomena where behavioural, neurophysiological, perceptive and cognitive changes occur during the therapeutic encounter in the healthcare context. Placebo effects are produced by a positive healthcare context; while nocebo effects are consequences of negative healthcare context. Historically, placebo, nocebo and context-related effects were considered as confounding elements for clinicians and researchers. In the last two decades this attitude started to change, and the understanding of the value of these effects has increased. Despite the growing interest, the knowledge and the awareness of using the healthcare context to trigger placebo and nocebo effects is currently limited and heterogeneous among physiotherapists, reducing their translational value in the physiotherapy field. OBJECTIVES: To introduce the placebo, nocebo and context-related effects by: (1) presenting their psychological models; (2) describing their neurophysiological mechanisms; (3) underlining their impact for the physiotherapy profession; and (4) tracing lines for future researches. CONCLUSION: Several psychological mechanisms are involved in placebo, nocebo and context-related effects; including expectation, learning processes (classical conditioning and observational learning), reinforced expectations, mindset and personality traits. The neurophysiological mechanisms mainly include the endogenous opioid, the endocannabinoid and the dopaminergic systems. Neuroimaging studies have identified different brain regions involved such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal gray and the dorsal horn of spine. From a clinical perspective, the manipulation of the healthcare context with the best evidence-based therapy represents an opportunity to trigger placebo effects and to avoid nocebo effects respecting the ethical code of conduct. From a managerial perspective, stakeholders, organizations and governments should encourage the assessment of the healthcare context aimed to improve the quality of physiotherapy services. From an educational perspective, placebo and nocebo effects are professional topics that should be integrated in the university program of health and medical professions. From a research perspective, the control of placebo, nocebo and context-related effects offers to the scientific community the chance to better measure the impact of physiotherapy on different outcomes and in different conditions through primary studies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral small vessel disease is increasingly prevalent and highly heterogeneous in neuroimaging and clinical presentation. Small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, cortical microinfarcts, and white matter hyperintensity of presumed vascular origin represent the major neuroimaging markers of small vessel disease. Increasing small vessel disease burden is associated with risk of incident stroke and dementia, as well as other neuropsychiatric symptoms.

SUMMARY               Cerebral small vessel disease is common in aging adults and represents a major risk factor for multiple acute and chronic neurologic diseases.

This article provides a practical approach to the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and unruptured brain AVMs and reviews the risk of rupture, risk factors for rupture, preventive treatment options with their associated risks, and the approach of treatment versus observation for both types of vascular malformations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, scoring systems on the risk of rupture can help with choosing preventive treatment or observation with follow-up imaging. Although the literature provides detailed information on the complication risks of preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, individualized predictions of these procedural complication risks are not yet available. With observation with imaging, growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms can be monitored, and prediction scores for growth can help determine the optimal timing of monitoring. The past years have revealed more about the risk of complications of the different treatment modalities for brain AVMs. A randomized clinical trial and prospective follow-up data have shown that preventive interventional therapy in patients with brain AVMs is associated with a higher rate of neurologic morbidity and mortality compared with observation.                                         SUMMARY               The risk of hemorrhage from both unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs varies depending on the number of risk factors associated with hemorrhage. For both types of vascular malformations, different preventive treatment options are available, and all carry risks of complications. For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, the consideration of preventive treatment versus observation is complex, and several factors should be included in the decision making. Overall, it is recommended that patients with unruptured asymptomatic brain AVMs should be observed.},

  abstract = {"Every student will be affected by pregnancy, either their mother's, because what happens in the womb does not necessarily stay in the womb, or by someone else's. As health care professionals, you will often encounter women of childbearing age who may be pregnant, or you may have children of your own, or maybe it is a friend who is pregnant. In any case, pregnancy and childbirth are relevant to all of us, and unfortunately, these processes often culminate in negative outcomes. For example, 50\% of all embryos are spontaneously aborted. Furthermore, prematurity and birth defects are the leading causes of infant mortality and major contributors to disabilities. Fortunately, new strategies can improve pregnancy outcomes, and health care professionals have a major role to play in implementing these initiatives. However, a basic knowledge of embryology is essential to the success of these strategies, and with this knowledge, every health care professional can play a role in providing healthier babies. To accomplish its goal of providing a basic understanding of embryology and its clinical relevance, Langman's Medical Embryology retains its unique approach of combining an economy of text with excellent diagrams and clinical images. It stresses the clinical importance of the subject by providing numerous clinical examples that result from abnormal embryological events. The following pedagogic features and updates in the 14th edition help facilitate student learning"--},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides an overview of the numerous causes of vertigo and dizziness that are due to central nervous system (CNS) pathology and guides clinicians in formulating a differential diagnosis and treating patients with CNS causes of vertigo. RECENT FINDINGS: Specific autoimmune vestibulocerebellar syndromes may now be tested for, and this article discusses the antibodies known to cause such syndromes. Superficial siderosis can be more accurately diagnosed with imaging studies, and treatment using iron chelation has recently been studied but has not yet been established as an effective treatment. Central autonomic network damage in the brain can cause central orthostatic hypotension in some neurodegenerative diseases, and medication has been approved for treatment. SUMMARY: CNS causes of vertigo are numerous and important for clinicians to recognize. Examination findings are still an extremely valuable way to diagnose central vertigo; therefore, learning how to differentiate central from peripheral vertigo based on examination is an important skill. CNS causes of vertigo often have available treatments.},

The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the effects of egg consumption on inflammation. A systematic search of online databases (Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), Scopus, Ovid, PubMed, Cochrane) was used to gather clinical trials that assessed the effect of egg consumption on circulating inflammatory biomarkers. Using a random-effects model, pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) and corresponding standard deviations (SD) were calculated. Of the 21 eligible studies found, nine trials were eligible for analysis. Eight trials assessed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), four trials assessed interleukin-6 (IL-6), and five trials assessed tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-               {$\alpha$}               ).

This article reviews the pathophysiology, etiology and risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes of spontaneous cervical artery dissection.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Cervical artery dissection is believed to be a multifactorial disease, with environmental factors serving as possible triggers in patients who have a genetic predisposition to dissection formation. Cervical artery dissection can cause local symptoms or ischemic events, such as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Neuroimaging is used to confirm the diagnosis; classic findings include a long tapered arterial stenosis or occlusion, dissecting aneurysm, intimal flap, double lumen, or intramural hematoma. Patients with cervical artery dissection who present with an acute ischemic stroke should be evaluated for IV thrombolysis, endovascular therapy eligibility, or both. Antithrombotic therapy with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment is used to prevent stroke from cervical artery dissection. The risk of recurrent ischemia appears low and is mostly limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Cervical artery dissection is a known cause of ischemic strokes. Current data show no difference between the benefits and risks of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy in the acute phase of symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection, thereby supporting the recommendation that clinicians can prescribe either treatment. Further research is warranted to better understand the pathophysiology and long-term outcomes of cervical artery dissection.},

The core diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of primary periodic paralysis, including clues to distinguish between the hypokalemic and hyperkalemic forms, and the distinctive elements that characterize Andersen-Tawil syndrome are discussed. Management of patients with these disorders is also discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Childhood presentations of periodic paralysis have recently been described, including atypical findings. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dichlorphenamide, have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic forms of periodic paralysis. Muscle MRI may be a useful outcome measure in pharmacologic trials in periodic paralysis.

RECENT FINDINGS               Whereas neurologic complications from traditional chemotherapy are widely recognized, newer cancer therapies, in particular immunotherapies, have unique and distinct patterns of neurologic adverse effects. Anticancer drugs may cause central or peripheral nervous system complications. Neurologic complications of therapy are being seen with increasing frequency as patients with cancer are living longer and receiving multiple courses of anticancer regimens, with novel agents, combinations, and longer duration. Neurologists must know how to recognize treatment-related neurologic toxicity since discontinuation of the offending agent or dose adjustment may prevent further or permanent neurologic injury. It is also imperative to differentiate neurologic complications of therapy from cancer progression into the nervous system and from comorbid neurologic disorders that do not require treatment dose reduction or discontinuation.                                         SUMMARY               Neurotoxicity from cancer therapy is common, with effects seen on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy are new cancer treatments with distinct patterns of neurologic complications. Early recognition and appropriate management are essential to help prevent further neurologic injury and optimize oncologic management.},

DESIGN: Etiology systematic review with meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: Database search of ProQuest, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase up to August 21, 2018. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: We included peer-reviewed articles that investigated whether lumbar spine position during lifting was a risk factor for LBP onset or persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lifting-task comparison data were tabulated and summarized. The meta-analysis calculated an n-weighted pooled mean {$\pm$} SD of the results in the LBP and no-LBP groups. If a study contained multiple comparisons (ie, different lifting tasks that used various weights or directions), then only 1 result from that study was included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Four studies (1 longitudinal study and 3 cross-sectional studies across 5 articles) included in meta-analysis measured lumbar flexion with intralumbar angles and found no difference in peak lumbar spine flexion when lifting (1.5{\textdegree}; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.7{\textdegree}, 3.7{\textdegree}; P = .19 for the longitudinal study and -0.9{\textdegree}; 95\% CI: -2.5{\textdegree}, 0.7{\textdegree}; P = .29 for the cross-sectional studies). Seven cross-sectional studies measured lumbar flexion with thoracopelvic angles and found that people with LBP lifted with 6.0{\textdegree} less lumbar flexion than people without LBP (95\% CI: -11.2{\textdegree}, -0.9{\textdegree}; P = .02). Most (9/11) studies reported no significant between-group differences in lumbar flexion during lifting. The included studies were of low quality. CONCLUSION: There was low-quality evidence that greater lumbar spine flexion during lifting was not a risk factor for LBP onset/persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP.

Coconut sugar is a healthier, sweetener option than the majority of other sugars that are commercially available. Sap is collected from trees to be transported, stored, and evaporated during processing, which are labor- and resource-intensive operations. Consequently, the cost of production is higher than it is for cane sugar. Given its high nutritional value and low glycemic index, people are willing to pay higher prices for it. However, one barrier is ignorance of its health benefits. This review examines and deals in-depth with the most significant features of coconut sugar chemical analyses to focus on several analytical methodologies given the increasing demand for naturally derived sweeteners in the last 10 years.

The major neurosurgical subspecialty procedures (cerebrovascular neurosurgery, neuro-oncology, epilepsy neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery, CSF diversion, endovascular neurosurgery, and spinal surgery) are broadly included under craniotomy procedures, endovascular/vascular procedures, and spinal procedures. This article focuses on the range of complications inherent in these approaches with specific scenarios addressed as applicable.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The morbidity and mortality related to neurosurgical procedures remains high, necessitating ongoing research and quality improvement efforts in perioperative screening, intraoperative management, surgical approaches, and postoperative care of these patients. Emerging research continues to investigate safer and newer options for routine neurosurgical approaches, such as coiling over clipping for amenable aneurysms, endoscopic techniques for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, and minimally invasive spinal procedures; postoperative monitoring and care of patients after these procedures continues to be a key component in the continuum of care for improving outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Postoperative care of patients undergoing major neurosurgical procedures is an integral part of many neurocritical care practices. Neurosurgeons often enlist help from neurologists to assist with evaluation, interpretation, and management of complications in routine inpatient settings. Awareness of the common neurologic complications of various neurosurgical procedures can help guide appropriate clinical monitoring algorithms and quality improvement processes for timely evaluation and management of these patients.},

DESIGN: We identified existing guidelines through a nationwide census and listed their recommendations, grouped according to the main steps of the process flow-chart. To assess reliability we analysed the variability of statements. To analyse validity we assessed the type of scientific evidence supporting the recommendations, and we compared them with a list of evidence-based recommendations that was elaborated for this study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Primary health care centres (n = 24) with guidelines for neck-pain treatment and follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We quantified the number of recommendations, the proportion of valid statements, the frequencies of non-evidence-based recommendations, and the absence of the evidence-based recommendations we had identified. RESULTS: The 34 identified guidelines contained 325 recommendations, with great variation between guidelines with respect to the number, type (for up to 26 different clinical decisions), and content of the recommendations they provided. Direct assessment of the scientific evidence was not possible because no specific reference was given to support any recommendation. When compared with our list, only 20.9\% of the recommendations could be considered evidence-based. No guideline contained all the eight evidence-based recommendations we identified. CONCLUSIONS: The results question the guidelines' reliability and validity, and their usefulness in ensuring quality. We conclude that guidelines should be reviewed and re-designed with greater scientific rigour.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               This article provides a review of the clinical phenotypes and evaluation of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes. These rare diagnoses include cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. Recent investigations have led to an understanding of the autoimmune underpinnings of these conditions and their specific associated antibodies. As the presentation of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes includes muscle stiffness, twitches, and spasms, which are also shared with certain central nervous system and myopathic conditions, the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes is reviewed.                                         Recent Findings:               Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes share clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of motor nerve instability; however, their clinical presentations are varied. Case reviews have helped us understand the spectrum of symptoms associated with the three peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes reviewed here: cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. More recently, research has focused on understanding the voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies as well as neoplasms associated with these conditions.                                         Summary:               The diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes requires a high index of suspicion, support from the physical examination, familiarity with the spectrum of symptoms associated with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes, and recognition of diagnostic EMG features. Voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies are associated with these conditions. Optimum treatment and autoimmune pathogenesis remain areas of active research.},

However, neurologic complications of HIV remain common; can affect any part of the neuraxis; and are due to direct effects of the virus, immunosuppression because of untreated HIV infection, aberrant immune responses in the setting of ART initiation, and ART toxicities.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains one of the most common neurologic complications of HIV encountered today, but milder forms predominate in people on ART. No specific treatments for HAND exist, but small trials and epidemiologic evidence suggest paroxetine, intranasal insulin, and maraviroc may have utility in its treatment; further trials of these agents are ongoing. Widespread ART use has decreased the incidence of central nervous system opportunistic infections, but prognosis often remains poor in those who develop opportunistic infections. High-titer positive serum cryptococcal antigen is strongly predictive of cryptococcal meningitis and provides a tool to enhance diagnosis in areas with limited resources. HIV is an independent risk factor for stroke, and accelerated aging associated with HIV infection results in neurologic diseases of older age occurring at much younger ages in individuals infected with HIV. Ongoing HIV replication in the CSF despite peripheral virologic suppression may contribute to the development of HAND and may not improve despite adjusting the ART regimen to increase central nervous system penetrance.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists are likely to encounter patients infected with HIV in clinical practice. This article reviews the presentation, diagnosis, and management of the most common neurologic conditions associated with HIV infection and ART.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Central nervous system (CNS) TB remains common and associated with significant mortality and neurologic sequelae worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is strongly associated with both the development of and mortality due to CNS TB.                 Strongyloides                 co-infection is associated with reduced CNS inflammation and improved outcomes in the setting of tuberculous meningitis. Stroke remains a common complication of tuberculous meningitis, and emerging evidence suggests aspirin may be used in this context. Although a recent nucleic acid amplification test has demonstrated suboptimal sensitivity in the diagnosis of CNS TB, emerging diagnostic techniques include cell-free DNA, peripheral blood microRNA, metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and advanced imaging techniques, but these are not yet well validated. CNS TB is associated with high mortality even with current treatment regimens, although novel, promising strategies for treatment are under investigation, including a combination of IV isoniazid and ethambutol and high-dose rifampicin.                                                        SUMMARY               TB can affect the nervous system in various ways and is associated with high mortality. Diagnosis remains challenging in endemic settings, with empiric treatment often initiated without a definitive diagnosis. Furthermore, optimal treatment regimens remain uncertain because current treatment for all forms of CNS TB is extrapolated from trials of tuberculous meningitis whereas the role of steroids in people with HIV and tuberculous meningitis remains controversial.},

Muscle growth during hypertrophy is controlled at the translational level, through the stimulation of protein synthesis, and at the transcriptional level, through the activation of ribosomal RNAs and muscle-specific genes. mTORC1 has a central role in the regulation of both protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis. Several transcription factors and co-activators, including MEF2, SRF, PGC-1{$\alpha$}4, and YAP promote the growth of the myofibers.

Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported results from analyses of studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Technical improvements in assay sensitivity and precision have led to the rapid development of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) over the past several years. Studies have found that the ratio of amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) peptides (A{$\beta$}42/A{$\beta$}40) and concentrations of phosphorylated tau isoforms in plasma can identify individuals with AD brain pathology.

This article also discusses the underlying proteinopathies of neurodegenerative diseases (eg, amyloid-{$\beta$}, paired helical filament tau, {$\alpha$}-synuclein, and TDP-43 pathology) and vascular pathologies, including tissue injury (eg, infarcts, hemorrhages) with or without vessel disease.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New criteria for AD pathologic diagnosis highlight amyloid-{$\beta$} as the                 sine qua non                 of AD; they require molecular markers of amyloid and establish a minimum threshold of Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage 3. Pathologic diagnosis is separated from clinical disease (ie, pathologic diagnosis no longer requires dementia). TDP-43 pathology, a major pathology in a frontotemporal dementia subtype, was found as a central pathology in LATE, a newly named amnestic disorder. Multiple pathologies (often co-occurring with AD) contribute to dementia and add complexity to the clinical picture. Conversely, Lewy body, LATE, and vascular dementias often have accompanying AD pathology. Pathology and biomarker studies highlight subclinical pathologies in older people without cognitive impairment. This resilience to brain pathology is common and is known as                 cognitive reserve                 .                                                        SUMMARY               The pathologies of dementia in aging are most commonly amyloid, tangles, Lewy bodies, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, and vascular pathologies. These pathologies often co-occur (mixed pathologies), which may make specific clinical diagnoses difficult. In addition, dementia-related pathologies are often subclinical, suggesting varying levels of resilience in older people.},

  abstract = {Correlation in the broadest sense is a measure of an association between variables. In correlated data, the change in the magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction. Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation coefficients are scaled such that they range from -1 to +1, where 0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the relationship in the population from which the data were sampled. The aim of this tutorial is to guide researchers and clinicians in the appropriate use and interpretation of correlation coefficients.},

Bodybuilders generally train with moderate loads and fairly short rest intervals that induce high amounts of metabolic stress. Powerlifters, on the other hand, routinely train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest periods between sets. Although both groups are known to display impressive muscularity, it is not clear which method is superior for hypertrophic gains. It has been shown that many factors mediate the hypertrophic process and that mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all can play a role in exercise-induced muscle growth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to extensively review the literature as to the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to exercise training and (b) to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal protocol for maximizing muscle growth.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PCA is usually an atypical form of Alzheimer disease with relatively young age at onset. New diagnostic criteria allow patients to be diagnosed on a syndromic basis as having a primary visual (pure) form or more complex (plus) form of PCA and, when possible, on a disease-specific basis using biomarkers or underlying pathology. Imaging techniques have demonstrated that some pathologic processes are concordant (atrophy, hypometabolism, tau deposition) with clinical symptoms and some are discordant (widespread amyloid deposition). International efforts are under way to establish the genetic underpinnings of this typically sporadic form of Alzheimer disease. In the absence of specific disease-modifying therapies, a number of practical suggestions can be offered to patients and their families to facilitate reading and activities of daily living, promote independence, and improve quality of life                                         SUMMARY               While rare, PCA is an important diagnostic entity for neurologists, ophthalmologists, and optometrists to recognize to allow for early accurate diagnosis and appropriate patient management.

This article is intended to educate the neurologist on the psychiatric manifestations of psychosis and its evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. How to differentiate a primary psychiatric cause of psychosis from psychosis secondary to a medical or neurologic condition is also reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Current research in psychotic disorders has focused increasingly on negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in psychotic illness, as it is now recognized that these cause the greatest impact on functional deficits for patients. A number of new medications have also been introduced to target negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in psychotic illness. These have new implications in terms of treatment overlap with medications being prescribed by providers in psychiatry, neurology, and general practice.                                         SUMMARY               This article discusses the current methods for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating psychosis. Psychosis as a primary mental health disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion, as psychosis can be a direct symptom of underlying medical or neurologic disease. Delirium and dementia are the two most important disorders to rule out. This article will help readers be more prepared to assess and treat the patient with psychosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger avoidance are recommended as preventive measures for all individuals with migraine. The decision to recommend additional migraine preventive therapy should consider the frequency of migraine attacks and headaches, extent of migraine-associated disability, frequency of using acute migraine treatments and the responsiveness to such treatments, and patient preferences. Additional therapies include prescription medications, nutraceuticals, neurostimulation, and behavioral therapy. Considering evidence for efficacy and the risk of potential side effects and adverse events, treatments with the most favorable profiles include (in alphabetical order): amitriptyline, beta-blockers (several), biofeedback, candesartan, coenzyme Q10, cognitive-behavioral therapy, magnesium citrate, onabotulinumtoxinA (for chronic migraine only), relaxation therapy, riboflavin, and topiramate. In addition, erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, received  approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraine in May 2018.                                         SUMMARY               Successful migraine preventive therapy reduces the frequency and burden of attacks while causing limited side effects. Individual treatment recommendations are determined based upon evidence for efficacy, side effect and adverse event profiles, medication interactions, patient comorbidity, costs, and patient preferences. Patients must be counseled on reasonable expectations for their preventive therapy and the importance of adhering to the recommended treatment plan for a period of time that is sufficient to determine outcomes.},

Early recognition of the clinical symptoms and rapid initiation of treatment is essential. Copper deficiency is now also recognized as causing a similar clinical picture as vitamin B                 12                 deficiency. Conditions leading to copper deficiency include bariatric surgery and excessive zinc intake. Unusual conditions such as lathyrism and konzo are relevant to all neurologists because of emigration from less well-developed countries. Myelopathy can also occur from substance abuse (eg, heroin and nitrous oxide), and early diagnosis could lead to improved patient outcomes. The spinal cord may also be injured in decompression illness that occurs in sport divers and individuals who work in pressurized atmospheres.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite clear benefits of the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) approach to ensuring quality and consistency of care, its uptake within physiotherapy has been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: Synthesise the findings of research into EBP barriers, facilitators and interventions in physiotherapy and identify methods of enhancing adoption and implementation. DATA SOURCES: Literature concerning physiotherapists' practice between 2000 and 2012 was systematically searched using: Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, American Psychological Association databases, Medline, Journal Storage, and Science Direct. Reference lists were searched to identify additional studies. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-two studies, focusing either on physiotherapists' EBP knowledge, attitudes or implementation, or EBP interventions in physiotherapy were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One author undertook all data extraction and a second author reviewed to ensure consistency and rigour. Synthesis was organised around the themes of EBP barriers/enablers, attitudes, knowledge/skills, use and interventions. RESULTS: Many physiotherapists hold positive attitudes towards EBP. However, this does not necessarily translate into consistent, high-quality EBP. Many barriers to EBP implementation are apparent, including: lack of time and skills, and misperceptions of EBP. LIMITATIONS: Only studies published in the English language, in peer-reviewed journals were included, thereby introducing possible publication bias. Furthermore, narrative synthesis may be subject to greater confirmation bias. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: There is no "one-size fits all" approach to enhancing EBP implementation; assessing organisational culture prior to designing interventions is crucial. Although some interventions appear promising, further research is required to explore the most effective methods of supporting physiotherapists' adoption of EBP.},

Key aspects of management and the future of diagnosis and care for the disorder are highlighted.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               BvFTD is a clinical syndrome, not a disease. Patients with the syndrome share core symptoms that reflect degeneration within the most consistently affected brain regions, but accompanying features vary and reflect the precise topography of regional degeneration. The clinician must distinguish a bvFTD syndrome from psychiatric illness and other neurodegenerative syndromes that feature a prominent behavioral component. Antemortem prediction of pathologic diagnosis remains imperfect but improves with careful attention to the clinical details. Management should emphasize prevention of caregiver distress, behavioral and environmental strategies, symptom-based psychopharmacology, and genetic counseling.                                         SUMMARY               BvFTD is an important and challenging dementia syndrome. Although disease-modifying treatments are lacking, clinicians can have a profound impact on a family coping with this disorder. Treatment trials are under way for some genetic forms of bvFTD. For sporadic disease, pathologic heterogeneity remains a major challenge, and ongoing research seeks to improve antemortem molecular diagnosis to facilitate therapeutic discovery.},

Zika virus is the most recent addition to this group, first causing sporadic cases of uncomplicated febrile illness followed by sizeable outbreaks in the Pacific. However, the epidemiology and clinical features of Zika virus infection have changed rapidly and dramatically; it is now recognized as causing Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome (GBS) in children and adults and congenital abnormalities in infected fetuses. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of Zika virus{\textendash}associated neurologic illness and briefly reviews features of West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Zika virus has emerged as a significant human pathogen in recent years. In 2015, it began to cause large outbreaks of febrile rash illness in South America and the Caribbean. During these large Zika virus outbreaks, a significant increase in the incidence of GBS was also observed in multiple countries/territories. Zika virus{\textendash}associated GBS has several unique features, including a relatively short interval between febrile illness and GBS onset, an unusually high incidence among older people, and prominent cranial nerve abnormalities. Congenital Zika syndrome includes a myriad of abnormalities, including microcephaly, lissencephaly, hydrocephalus, arthrogryposis, and parenchymal calcifications. Currently, no treatment has been identified for Zika virus, although work on vaccines is under way.                                         SUMMARY               Arboviruses continue to surprise us with unexpected emergence in various locations, the nature of clinical illness, and outcomes. Zika virus presents a classic example of this type of emergence. Ongoing surveillance will be needed to evaluate the long-term pattern of Zika virus and related arboviruses.},

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of mentally challenging computer work performed with and without exposure to a psychosocial stressor on cervical muscle activity and posture. Changes in cervical posture and electromyography of upper trapezius, cervical extensor, and sternocleidomastoid muscles were compared between a resting seated posture at baseline, a low stress condition with mental concentration, and a high stress condition with mental concentration and psychosocial stress in sixty healthy office workers. Forward head posture significantly increased with mental concentration compared to baseline, but did not change with further introduction of the stressor. Muscle activity significantly increased from the low stress to high stress condition for both the dominant and non-dominant upper trapezius, with no corresponding change in activity of the cervical extensors or flexors between stress conditions. These findings suggest that upper trapezius muscles are selectively activated by psychosocial stress independent of changes in concentration or posture, which may have implications for the prevention of stress-related trapezius myalgia in the workplace.},

While attributes of the disease have been recognized for over two centuries, gaps in knowledge remain related to its prevention and management. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge for CSVD.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                CSVD can be recognized by well-defined radiographic criteria, but the pathogenic mechanism behind the disease is unclear. Hypertension control remains the best-known strategy for stroke prevention in patients with CSVD, and recent guidelines provide a long-term blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg for patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, including those with stroke related to CSVD. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and may be increasingly recognized because of newer, more sensitive imaging modalities.                 Transient focal neurologic episodes                 is a relatively new term used to describe ``amyloid spells.'' Guidance on distinguishing these events from seizures and transient ischemic attacks has been published.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               CSVD is prevalent and will likely be encountered by all neurologists in clinical practice. It is important for neurologists to be able to recognize CSVD, both radiographically and clinically, and to counsel patients on the prevention of disease progression. Blood pressure control is especially relevant, and strategies are needed to improve blood pressure control for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with CSVD.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Endovascular stroke therapy has greatly improved the ability to treat the deadliest and most disabling form of acute ischemic stroke. This article summarizes some of the recent innovations in this field and discusses likely future developments.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               At present, there is robust activity to improve all facets of care for patients with large vessel occlusion stroke, including better prehospital routing, more efficient in-hospital screening, expanding indications for thrombectomy eligibility, innovating novel thrombectomy devices, and improving the effects of recanalization on clinical outcomes. In addition, the integration of endovascular stroke therapy (EVT){\textemdash}an emergent and frequently off-hours procedure that requires a specialized team of nurses, technologists, and physicians{\textemdash}into acute stroke care has transformed referral patterns, hospital accreditation pathways, and physician practices. The eligibility for the procedure will potentially continue to grow to include patients screened without advanced imaging, larger core infarcts, and more distal occlusions.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               In this review, we discuss the current state of EVT and its implications for practice, and present three cases that highlight some of the directions in which the field is moving.},

However, numerous highly publicized observational studies of the effect of prevention on health outcomes have reported exaggerated relationships that were later contradicted by randomized controlled trials. A growing body of research has identified sources of bias in observational studies that are related to patient behaviors or underlying patient characteristics, known as the healthy user effect, the healthy adherer effect, confounding by functional status or cognitive impairment, and confounding by selective prescribing. In this manuscript we briefly review observational studies of prevention that have appeared to reach incorrect conclusions. We then describe potential sources of bias in these studies and discuss study designs, analytical methods, and sensitivity analyses that may mitigate bias or increase confidence in the results reported. More careful consideration of these sources of bias and study designs by providers can enhance evidence-based decision-making.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Six randomized controlled trials undoubtedly confirmed the benefits of using endovascular thrombectomy on the clinical outcome of patients with stroke with large vessel occlusion within 6 hours from symptom onset compared with those receiving only standard medical care. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data, the number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on the modified Rankin Scale for one patient was 2.6. Recently, the concept of ``tissue window'' versus time window has proved useful for selecting patients for mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours from symptom onset. The DAWN (DWI or CTP Assessment With Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake-Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention) trial included patients at a median of 12.5 hours from onset and showed the largest effect in functional outcome ever described in any acute stroke treatment trial (35.5\% increase in functional independence). In DEFUSE 3 (Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution 3), patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy at a median of 11 hours after onset had a 28\% increase in functional independence and an additional 20\% absolute reduction in death or severe disability.                                         SUMMARY               For patients with acute ischemic stroke and a large vessel occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation who can be treated within 6 hours of stroke symptom onset, mechanical thrombectomy with a second-generation stent retriever or a catheter aspiration device should be indicated regardless of whether the patient received treatment with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients with limited signs of early ischemic changes on neuroimaging. Two clinical trials completely disrupted the time window concept in acute ischemic stroke, showing excellent clinical outcomes in patients treated up to 24 hours from symptom onset. Time of ischemia is, on average, a good biomarker for tissue viability; however, the window of opportunity for treatment varies across different individuals because of a range of compensatory mechanisms. Adjusting time to the adequacy of collateral flow leads to the concept of tissue window, a paradigm shift in stroke reperfusion therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The exponential growth of genetic testing is due to its increased speed and decreasing cost, and it is now a routine part of the clinical care for a number of neurologic patients. In addition, phenotypic pleiotropy (mutations in the same gene causing very disparate phenotypes) and genetic heterogeneity (the same clinical phenotype resulting from mutations in different genes) are now known to exist in a number of conditions, adding an additional layer of complexity for genetic testing in these disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Although the growing complexity of technical knowledge in the ordering and interpretation of genetic tests makes it necessary for neurologists to consult medical geneticists, limitations in the availability of such professionals often means neurologists will be on the front line dealing with suspected or confirmed neurogenetic conditions. The growing availability of broad genetic testing through chromosomal microarray and next-generation sequencing and the expanded phenotypic spectrum of many conditions has implications for genetic counseling and medical management. This article discusses the various forms of genetic variability and how to test for each of them. It also provides an update on the most common forms of neurologic presentations of genetic disease and a review of testing strategies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The past several years have seen a dramatic increase in the ability to test for many inherited and autoimmune neuromuscular disorders more reliably and accurately. Similarly, numerous targeted therapies have been recently approved to treat previously untreatable disorders. Therefore, timely and accurate diagnosis is essential so that patients can receive appropriate therapy, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Muscle weakness is a common symptom resulting from dysfunction that can occur at any level of the neuraxis and is a cardinal feature of many neuromuscular disorders. An accurate and meticulous history and a thorough neurologic examination are paramount in localizing the lesion in order to generate a differential diagnosis and guide appropriate ancillary testing. The patient's age at symptom onset, any identified inciting factors, tempo of symptom progression, pattern of weakness, and associated symptoms and signs are all important diagnostic clues in the evaluation of a patient presenting with muscle weakness.},

It is hoped that a greater understanding of each of these components will provide clinicians with the necessary information to deliver thoughtful and optimal care to affected individuals.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances include the finding that Tourette syndrome is likely due to a combination of several different genes, both low-effect and larger-effect variants, plus environmental factors. Pathophysiologically, increasing evidence supports involvement of the cortical{\textendash}basal ganglia{\textendash}thalamocortical circuit; however, the primary location and neurotransmitter remain controversial. Behavioral therapy is first-line treatment, and pharmacotherapy is based on tic severity. Several newer therapeutic agents are under investigation (eg, valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, cannabinoids), and deep brain stimulation is a promising therapy.                                         SUMMARY               Tics, defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations, are essential components of Tourette syndrome. Although some tics may be mild, others can cause significant psychosocial, physical, and functional difficulties that affect daily activities. In addition to tics, most affected individuals have coexisting neuropsychological difficulties (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, mood disorder, disruptive behaviors, schizotypal traits, suicidal behavior, personality disorder, antisocial activities, and sleep disorders) that can further impact social and academic activities or employment.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PRES and RCVS are descriptive terms, each bringing together conditions with similar clinical-imaging manifestations. Headache, visual symptoms, seizures, and confusion occur in both syndromes. RCVS is usually heralded by recurrent thunderclap headaches, whereas encephalopathy and seizures are typical in PRES. In PRES, brain imaging shows reversible vasogenic edema that is typically symmetric and located in subcortical regions (mostly posterior predominant). In RCVS, brain imaging is often normal; cerebral angiography shows segmental vasoconstriction-vasodilatation affecting the circle of Willis arteries and their branches. Aside from shared clinical features, significant imaging overlap exists. Both PRES and RCVS can be complicated by ischemic and hemorrhagic brain lesions; angiographic abnormalities frequently occur in PRES and vasogenic edematous lesions in RCVS. Common triggers (eg, eclampsia, vasoconstrictive and chemotherapeutic agents) have been identified. Abnormal cerebrovascular tone and endothelial dysfunction may explain both syndromes. Management of these syndromes includes the removal of identified triggers, symptomatic treatment of headache or seizures, and moderate blood pressure control. Both syndromes are self-limited, with clinical recovery occurring within days to weeks. Long-term deficits and mortality are uncommon.                                         SUMMARY               PRES and RCVS have been well characterized and acknowledged to have significant overlap. Advances in our understanding of pathophysiology and risk factors for poor outcome are expected to optimize the management of these not uncommon syndromes.},

This article provides clinicians with a distilled understanding of the diagnoses and their epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               Cough-induced headache requires neuroimaging to exclude posterior fossa pathology and recently has been reported as a common symptom in patients with CSF-venous fistula. Clinical overlap is observed between patients with primary exercise headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity. Patients with recurrent thunderclap headache associated with sexual activity should be presumed to have reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome until proven otherwise. De novo external-pressure headache is a common sequela among health care workers using personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily persistent headache is an important mimicker of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache and is distinguished by a daily-from-onset progression of persistent headache; a treatment-refractory course is often observed, and early involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including a psychotherapist, is advised.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with primary headache disorders that are classified as ``other primary headache disorders'' have presentations with unique diagnostic and management considerations. The disorders are highly recognizable, and an appreciation of the diagnoses will aid clinicians in providing safe and effective care for patients presenting with headache.},

RECENT FINDINGS               A new approach to classifying dystonia has been created with the aim to increase the recognition and diagnosis of dystonia. Molecular biology and genetic studies have identified several genes and biological pathways involved in dystonia.                                         SUMMARY               Dystonia is a common movement disorder involving abnormal, often twisting, postures and is a challenging condition to diagnose. The pathophysiology of dystonia involves abnormalities in brain motor networks in the context of genetic factors. Dystonia has genetic, idiopathic, and acquired forms, with a wide phenotypic spectrum, and is a common feature in complex neurologic disorders. Dystonia can be isolated or combined with another movement disorder and may be focal, segmental, multifocal, or generalized in distribution, with some forms only occurring during the performance of specific tasks (task-specific dystonia). Dystonia is classified by clinical characteristics and presumed etiology. The management of dystonia involves accurate diagnosis, followed by treatment with botulinum toxin injections, oral medications, and surgical therapies (mainly deep brain stimulation), as well as pathogenesis-directed treatments, including the prospect of disease-modifying or gene therapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most often diagnosed degenerative pathologies within the lumbar spine. Paraspinal muscle involvement could be a possible mediator in the pathophysiology of disc herniation and influences the course of pain and disability after both surgical or nonsurgical treatment. To potentially improve treatment, it may be important to assess multifidus muscle morphology in patients diagnosed with a LDH. OBJECTIVE: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis regarding the multifidus morphology in patients diagnosed with a LDH was conducted to assess the differences in multifidus muscle morphology between persons with LDH and healthy controls, and between the involved and the uninvolved side within subjects experiencing unilateral LDH. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of articles published up to and including November 2019 using the Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and MEDLINE Ovid search engines. The articles obtained from this search were screened based on title and abstract using the predetermined eligibility criteria. Included full text articles were assessed for their methodologic quality using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Heterogeneous data regarding multifidus muscle morphology was included in the descriptive analysis; data that was homogenous was included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 3,176 articles. Based on the screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, 18 articles were included. Studies were either cross sectional or case-control studies assessing side-to-side differences or comparing patients diagnosed with a LDH to a healthy control group. Nine studies investigated whole muscle atrophy, six looked at muscle fat infiltration, seven studies assessed microscopic muscle properties including muscle fiber size, distribution, and muscle fibrosis. From the 18 articles, 10 were included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, a comparison was made between side-to-side differences for muscle fiber size, distribution, and whole muscle size. Descriptive analysis showed increased fat infiltration and atrophy (muscle and individual fiber) of the multifidus muscle when comparing side-to-side differences or comparing cases to controls. Meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in type I and II muscle fiber size (p=.002, .01, respectively) combined with a significant increase in the number of type I muscle fibers (p=.008) at the side of LDH. Regarding whole muscle size, no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the presence of ipsilateral multifidus muscle changes in persons with unilateral LDH.},

The phenomenology of chorea is described in addition to other common hyperkinetic movements that may be mistaken for or coexist with chorea. Chorea can be acquired or hereditary. Key historical and clinical features that can aid in determining the etiology are reviewed, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Clinical investigations are under way to target transcription and translation of the mutant huntingtin protein as a potential disease-modifying strategy in Huntington disease (HD). Additional heritable factors have been revealed through genome-wide association studies. Symptom-focused treatments for HD are are being studied, including a third vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor for chorea attenuation and drugs to target irritability and cognitive impairment. Increased availability of genetic testing has led to increased awareness of HD mimics (eg,                 C9orf72                 and IgLON5).                                                        SUMMARY               Chorea is a relatively common hyperkinetic disorder with a broad differential. The first step in the approach to a patient with chorea is accurately defining the phenomenology. Once it has been determined that the patient has chorea, the investigation into determining an etiology can begin. Factors such as age of onset, time course, family history, unique clinical features, and imaging and laboratory findings can guide the diagnosis. Treatments for most causes of chorea are purely symptomatic, although it is important to recognize causes that are reversible or have disease-modifying interventions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The manufacture, distribution, and use of so-called designer drugs are increasing. These agents can induce dramatic neurologic manifestations and can evade identification on conventional drug-screening assays. Additionally, gabapentinoids, drug agents that are very familiar to neurologists, are being abused in the general population at increasing rates to achieve euphoric highs and potentiate the effects of opiates. Furthermore, even well-known illicit narcotics such as heroin are posing dangers above their baseline because of ``lacing'' with additives or substitutes such as fentanyl and related compounds. These clandestine agents increase the potency of what are thought to be typical dosages to lethal levels, thus leading to more unintentional overdose deaths.                                         SUMMARY               The potential for short- and long-term nervous system injury from drug abuse is well established. However, it is important for the practicing neurologist to possess awareness of the features and observed sequelae of the toxidromes of both traditional and nontraditional drugs of abuse. This is because the use of both is widespread in our society and conventional drug screening can miss detection of some powerful agents, thus forcing us to maintain a high index of suspicion based on recognition of the clinical features.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and similar derivatives have exploded in prevalence, becoming the leading cause of overdose fatalities. The higher potency of synthetic opioids compared with semisynthetic and nonsynthetic opiates poses an increased risk for unintentional overdose when found as an adulterant in other illicit drug supplies such as heroin. Conversely, misinformation about the risk of symptomatic exposure to fentanyl through casual contact with the skin and ambient air has led to misdirected fear and stigma that threatens to impede valid harm-reduction measures for fentanyl users at risk of actual overdose. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose rates and deaths continued to climb, especially among those who use opioids and methamphetamine.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               A variety of potential neurologic effects and injuries can occur with illicit drug use owing to the diverse properties and mechanisms of action of the various classes. Many high-risk agents are not detected on standard drug screens, including so-called designer drugs, and the practicing neurologist is best served by recognizing the clinical features of the traditional toxidrome and other potential idiosyncratic effects of various illicit agents.},

  abstract = {Patients with complex regional pain syndrome suffer from chronic neuropathic pain and also show a decrease in sensorimotor performance associated with characteristic central and peripheral neural system parameters. In the brain imaging domain, these comprise altered functional sensorimotor representation for the affected hand side. With regard to neurophysiology, a decrease in intracortical inhibition for the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the affected hand has been repetitively verified, which might be related to increased primary somatosensory cortex functional activation for the affected limb. Rare longitudinal intervention studies in randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that a decrease in primary somatosensory cortex functional MRI activation coincided with pain relief and recovery in sensorimotor performance. By applying a randomized wait-list control crossover study design, we tested possible associations of clinical, imaging and neurophysiology parameters in 21 patients with complex regional pain syndrome in the chronic stage ({$>$}6 months). In more detail, we applied graded motor imagery over 6 weeks to relieve movement pain of the affected upper limb. First, baseline parameters were tested between the affected and the non-affected upper limb side and age-matched healthy controls. Second, longitudinal changes in clinical and testing parameters were associated with neurophysiological and imaging parameters. During baseline short intracortical inhibition, as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation, was decreased only for hand muscles of the affected hand side. During movement of the affected limb, primary somatosensory cortex functional MRI activation was increased. Hand representation area size for somatosensory stimulation in functional MRI was smaller on the affected side with longer disease duration. Graded motor imagery intervention but not waiting, resulted in a decrease of movement pain. An increase of somatosensory hand representation size over graded motor imagery intervention was related to movement pain relief. Over graded motor imagery intervention, pathological parameters like the increased primary somatosensory cortex activation during fist movement or decreased short intracortical inhibition were modified in the same way as movement pain and hand performance improved. No such changes were observed during the waiting period. Overall, we demonstrated characteristic changes in clinical, behaviour and neuropathology parameters applying graded motor imagery in patients with upper limb complex regional pain syndrome, which casts light on the effects of graded motor imagery intervention on biomarkers for chronic neuropathic pain.},

This article reviews common inherited nervous system tumor syndromes including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The epidemiology, genetics, approach to diagnosis, neurologic and nonneurologic manifestations, and management options are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Awareness of the more common and clinically relevant familial nervous system tumor syndromes is important. These conditions teach us about the underlying biology that drives tumor development in the central and peripheral nervous systems including peripheral nerve sheath tumors (eg, neurofibroma, schwannoma), meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, and hemangioblastoma. Knowledge of the clinical manifestations ensures that the neurologist will be able to diagnose these conditions, recommend appropriate surveillance, refer to specialists, and support optimal management. Important discoveries in the role of the underlying genetics have contributed to the launch of several novel drug trials for these tumors, which are changing therapeutic options for patients.                                         SUMMARY               Familial nervous system tumor syndromes are uncommon conditions that require specialized surveillance and management strategies. Coordination across a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, neuro-oncologists, radiologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, otolaryngologists, pathologists, neuropsychologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists, and geneticists is necessary for the optimal treatment of these patients.},

Moreover, the combination of RF and other compounds or drugs can have a wide variety of effects and protective properties, and diminish the toxic effect of drugs in several treatments. Research has been done in order to review the latest findings about the link between RF and different clinical aberrations. Since further studies have been published in this field, it is appropriate to consider a re-evaluation of the importance of RF in terms of its beneficial properties.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The guidelines for acute and preventive treatment of migraine were updated in 2019. These guidelines summarize the available evidence and outline the questions that should be addressed in future research. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of several new classes of drugs and devices to treat adult migraine in the past few years has resulted in ongoing or planned pediatric trials.                                         SUMMARY               Headache is a common symptom in children, and it is important to take a detailed history and perform a thorough physical examination to make the diagnosis. Nearly 1 in 10 children experience recurrent headaches due to migraine, which cause significant impairment in school performance and quality of life. The acute and preventive treatments that are currently available will help at least two-thirds of children with migraine, and several trials of new therapies offer hope for the future.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Laboratory and imaging biomarkers are being developed for accurate diagnosis of neurobehavioral disorders, yet few are currently available for clinical use. Moreover, not all centers have access to these potential tools. Practicing clinicians are therefore left primarily with their skills of history taking and examination. Although geared for research, diagnostic criteria have been refined over the past several years and can nevertheless aid the clinician with the diagnosis of disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, the primary progressive aphasias, corticobasal syndrome, vascular cognitive impairment, and posterior cortical atrophy.

Although some drugs and hormones can affect metabolism in skeletal muscle, this review will focus on the genetic metabolic myopathies.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Impairments in glycogenolysis/glycolysis (glycogen storage disease), fatty acid transport/oxidation (fatty acid oxidation defects), and mitochondrial metabolism (mitochondrial myopathies) represent most metabolic myopathies; however, they often overlap clinically with structural genetic myopathies, referred to as pseudometabolic myopathies. Although metabolic myopathies can present in the neonatal period with hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy, most cases present clinically in children or young adults with exercise intolerance, rhabdomyolysis, and weakness. In general, the glycogen storage diseases manifest during brief bouts of high-intensity exercise; in contrast, fatty acid oxidation defects and mitochondrial myopathies usually manifest during longer-duration endurance-type activities, often with fasting or other metabolic stressors (eg, surgery, fever). The neurologic examination is often normal between events (except in the pseudometabolic myopathies) and evaluation requires one or more of the following tests: exercise stress testing, blood (eg, creatine kinase, acylcarnitine profile, lactate, amino acids), urine (eg, organic acids, myoglobin), muscle biopsy (eg, histology, ultrastructure, enzyme testing), and targeted (specific gene) or untargeted (myopathy panels) genetic tests.                                         SUMMARY               Definitive identification of a specific metabolic myopathy often leads to specific interventions, including lifestyle, exercise, and nutritional modifications; cofactor treatments; accurate genetic counseling; avoidance of specific triggers; and rapid treatment of rhabdomyolysis.},

Following a two-phase evaluation, eight SRMs were selected for final review with the Qualiveen and Short-Form (SF) Qualiveen and the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score (NBDS) being recommended as supplemental, highly-recommended due to their strong psychometrics and extensive use in SCI/D. Two datasets and other SRM measures were recommended as supplemental.Conclusion: There is no one single measure that can be used to assess NBB dysfunction across all clinical research studies. Clinical and diagnostic tools are here recommended based on specific medical needs of the person with SCI/D. Following the CDE for SCI studies guidelines, we recommend both the SF-Qualiveen for bladder and the NBDS for bowel as relatively short measures with strong psychometrics. Other measures are also recommended. A combination of assessment tools (objective and subjective) to be used jointly across the spectrum of care seems critical to best capture changes related to NBB and develop better treatments.},

Recent Findings:               As most cases of acute low back pain have a favorable prognosis, current guidelines on imaging studies recommend conservative treatment for 6 weeks prior to obtaining an MRI if no red flags are present. Of these red flags, a prior history of cancer is the strongest risk factor for a malignant etiology and requires urgent evaluation with MRI. Management of acute low back pain is mainly conservative with oral non-narcotic analgesics and mobilization as the initial recommendations. For patients with radiculopathy, epidural steroids may result in short-term pain relief, but long-term effects are still unclear.

  abstract = {Several intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) are available to assess the interrater reliability (IRR) of observational measurements. Selecting an ICC is complicated, and existing guidelines have three major limitations. First, they do not discuss incomplete designs, in which raters partially vary across subjects. Second, they provide no coherent perspective on the error variance in an ICC, clouding the choice between the available coefficients. Third, the distinction between fixed or random raters is often misunderstood. Based on generalizability theory (GT), we provide updated guidelines on selecting an ICC for IRR, which are applicable to both complete and incomplete observational designs. We challenge conventional wisdom about ICCs for IRR by claiming that raters should seldom (if ever) be considered fixed. Also, we clarify how to interpret ICCs in the case of unbalanced and incomplete designs. We explain four choices a researcher needs to make when selecting an ICC for IRR, and guide researchers through these choices by means of a flowchart, which we apply to three empirical examples from clinical and developmental domains. In the Discussion, we provide guidance in reporting, interpreting, and estimating ICCs, and propose future directions for research into the ICCs for IRR.

SUMMARY               The most frequently encountered primary neuralgias are trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, and, rarely, glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Nervus intermedius neuralgia is even more rare. All neuralgias merit a careful workup for secondary causes. Drug treatment generally relies on antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA can be useful in treating some cranial neuralgias. Surgical and invasive treatments include ablation, gamma knife treatment, and microvascular decompression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: The Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) is considered a simple quantification tool to assess static foot alignment. Palpation of the foot is required for assessment of one of the six criteria that comprise the FPI-6; the remaining five criteria may be evaluated using still-frame photographs. Using only the image-based criteria may allow multiple clinicians to evaluate large groups of patients quickly. Reliability using only these five image-based criteria has not been established. The purposes of the current study were to establish the inter- and intra-rater reliability using five image-based criteria from the Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) as well as to examine the agreement between the raters in identifying foot type using the composite five FPI scores. METHODS: Forty participants (23 females, 17 males; 23.67 {$\pm$} 8.49 years; 64.59 {$\pm$} 14.43 kg; 166.07 {$\pm$} 11.79 cm) volunteered for this study. An investigator took three photos with a digital camera of the medial longitudinal arch, posterior ankle, and of the talonavicular joint approximately 45{\textdegree} from the posterior calcaneus for both right and left feet. Two investigators assessed the five image-based criteria of the FPI-6 for both feet of 40 participants on three occasions separated by a day. Inter-and intra-rater reliability were assessed with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC3,2). The amount of agreement for classification of foot posture type between the two raters was assessed with Cohen's kappa coefficient. Significance was set a priori at P {$<$} 0.05. RESULTS: The inter-rater reliability was poor to moderate for all three sessions (ICC3,2 = 0.334-0.634). For the foot posture classification, the amount of agreement between two raters was poor for left ({$\kappa$}= 0.12) and right ({$\kappa$}= 0.19) feet. The intra-rater reliability was excellent for left (ICC3,2=0.956) and right feet (ICC3,2=0.959). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent intra-rater and poor to moderate inter-rater reliability was found using only the five image-based criteria of the FPI-6. However, the classification of foot posture did not improve the amount of agreement between raters. Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting FPI scores from five image-based criteria.

RECENT FINDINGS                                C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including                 NKX2-1                 ,                 ADCY5, GNAO1,                 and                 PDE10A                 . New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing.

  abstract = {The role of the trigeminal system in facial and dural sensitivity has been recognized for a long time. More recently, the trigeminal system has also been considered a prominent actor in brain nociceptive innervation. It is the anatomical substrate of several frequent conditions, such as primary or secondary headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and other orofacial pains. Appreciation of the delicate anatomical arrangement of the trigeminal pathway is one of the keys to understanding these conditions' pathophysiology and to proposing innovative treatments. This review provides a structured presentation of existing knowledge about the trigeminal system, from classical anatomical data to the most recent literature. First, we present the organization of the trigeminal pathway from the trigeminal divisions, nerve, and nuclei to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex. We describe the neurons and fibers' repartition at each level, depending on the location (somatotopic organization) and the type of receptors (modal organization). Such a dual somatotopic-modal arrangement of the trigeminal fibers is especially clear for the juxtapontine segment of the trigeminal nerve and the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. It has significant clinical consequences both for diagnosis and treatment. Second, we explore how the trigeminal system is modulated and involved in reflexes, for instance the trigemino-cardiac and the trigemino-autonomic reflexes, which could play an essential role in the autonomic symptoms observed in cluster headache. Finally, we present how to interact with this complex system to relieve pain mediated by the trigeminal system. This section covers both neuromodulatory and lesional approaches.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Identification of the etiology of chronic meningitis remains challenging, with no cause identified in at least one-third of cases. Often, several serologic, CSF, and neuroimaging studies are indicated, although novel diagnostic platforms including metagenomic deep sequencing may hold promise for identifying organisms. Infectious etiologies are more common in those at risk for disseminated disease, specifically those who are immunocompromised because of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplantation, or immunosuppressant medications. An important step in identifying the etiology of chronic meningitis is assembling a multidisciplinary team of individuals, including those with specialized expertise in ophthalmology, dermatology, rheumatology, and infectious diseases, to provide guidance regarding diagnostic procedures.                                         SUMMARY               Chronic meningitis is defined as inflammation involving the meninges that lasts at least 4 weeks and is associated with a CSF pleocytosis. Chronic meningitis has numerous possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies, making it challenging to definitively diagnose patients. Therefore, a multifaceted approach that combines history, physical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory analysis, including novel diagnostic platforms, is needed. This article focuses on key aspects of the evaluation of and approach to patients with chronic meningitis. Specific infectious etiologies and differential diagnoses of subacute and chronic meningitis, including noninfectious etiologies, are addressed.},

Since diet may potentially affect OA, we reviewed the literature on the relationship between nutrition and OA risk or progression, aiming to provide guidance for clinicians. For overweight/obese patients, weight reduction, ideally incorporating exercise, is paramount. The association between metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes and OA risk or progression may partly explain the apparent benefit of dietary-lipid modification resulting from increased consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty-acids from oily fish/fish oil supplements. A strong association between OA and raised serum cholesterol together with clinical effects in statin users suggests a potential benefit of reduction of cholesterol by dietary means. Patients should ensure that they meet the recommended intakes for micronutrients such as vitamin K, which has a role in bone/cartilage mineralization. Evidence for a role of vitamin D supplementation in OA is unconvincing.},

However, several recent studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptor. This study focuses on the effects of pure glyphosate on estrogen receptors (ERs) mediated transcriptional activity and their expressions. Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer, T47D cells, but not in hormone-independent breast cancer, MDA-MB231 cells, at 10{$^{-12}$} to 10{$^{-6}$}M in estrogen withdrawal condition. The proliferative concentrations of glyphosate that induced the activation of estrogen response element (ERE) transcription activity were 5-13 fold of control in T47D-KBluc cells and this activation was inhibited by an estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, indicating that the estrogenic activity of glyphosate was mediated via ERs. Furthermore, glyphosate also altered both ER{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} expression. These results indicated that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate possessed estrogenic activity. Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used for soybean cultivation, and our results also found that there was an additive estrogenic effect between glyphosate and genistein, a phytoestrogen in soybeans. However, these additive effects of glyphosate contamination in soybeans need further animal study.},

This article reviews the diagnostic criteria, clinical features, neuroimaging findings, differential diagnosis, and management options for this condition.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent population studies have found that the annual incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is increasing in association with obesity rates, whereas recent scientific studies indicate a possible role for androgen sex hormones and adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of the disease. Prospective clinical trials have demonstrated a role for weight loss, acetazolamide, and topiramate in the management of mild disease. A recently begun randomized multicenter trial of surgical interventions will provide insight into the indications for surgical intervention, optimal timing and choice of intervention, and long-term outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder producing symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of an alternative cause. The main goals of treatment are to preserve visual function and alleviate symptoms, which can usually be achieved with a combination of weight loss, medical therapies, and surgical interventions depending on the severity of symptoms and vision loss, response to treatment, and subsequent clinical course.},

Inadequate transition planning and execution can lead to gaps in care, unexpected emergency department visits, and an increase in health care costs and patient/caregiver anxiety. Many barriers that prevent adequate transition have been identified, including insufficient time or staff to provide transition services, inadequate reimbursement, resistance from patients and caregivers, and a dearth of accepting adult providers.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Transition is distinct from transfer of care. Transition is a planned multistage process, while transfer refers to a point in time where responsibility of care shifts from one provider to another. Key differences exist between the pediatric and adult models of care. A successful transition should empower the patient to understand and take responsibility in managing his or her condition; foster independent functioning to the extent that is possible; integrate educational, legal, and community resources in the care plan; and identify appropriate adult health care providers at the time of transfer. Different models have been proposed to streamline the transition process, with improvement in patients' knowledge of their condition, self-efficacy, and confidence.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists have a key role in supporting their patients in the transition to adulthood. This article reviews basic tenets and provides tools to assist in navigating the complex transition process. These tenets are intended to improve quality of care and decrease clinician burden and remain an active area of research.},

Latest Developments               Although most have historically been classified as autoimmune disorders, rheumatologic diseases are increasingly conceptualized as distributed along a spectrum with various contributions of autoimmune (adaptive immune dysregulation) and autoinflammatory (innate immune dysregulation) mechanisms. Our evolving understanding of systemic immune-mediated disorders has been accompanied by an expansion in our differential diagnoses and therapeutic options.                                         Essential Points               Rheumatologic disease involves both autoimmune and autoinflammatory mechanisms. Neurologic symptoms can be the first manifestation of these disorders, and familiarity with the systemic manifestations of specific diseases is essential to establish the correct diagnosis. Conversely, knowledge of the neurologic syndromes that are most likely to be associated with specific systemic disorders can help narrow the differential and increase confidence when attributing a neuropsychiatric symptom to an underlying systemic disorder.},

RECENT FINDINGS               An increasing awareness exists about the genotype-phenotype overlap in skeletal muscle channelopathies, and thus genetic testing is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. Electrodiagnostic testing in channelopathies is highly specialized with significant overlap in various mutation subtypes. Randomized clinical trials have now been conducted in these disorders with expanded treatment options for patients with muscle channelopathies.                                         SUMMARY               Skeletal muscle channelopathies are rare heterogeneous conditions characterized by lifelong symptoms that require a comprehensive management plan that includes pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. The significant variability in biophysical features of various mutations, coupled with the difficulties of performing clinical trials in rare diseases, makes it challenging to design and implement treatment trials for muscle channelopathies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The results of several large brain bank case series among subjects with a history of contact sports or repetitive head trauma have indicated that a high frequency of CTE may exist in this population. However, the true prevalence of CTE among individuals with a history of head trauma remains unknown, given that individuals who experienced cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms during life are more likely to have their brains donated for autopsy at death and epidemiologic studies of the condition are lacking. Neuropathologic consensus criteria have been published. Research-based clinical criteria have been proposed and are beginning to be applied, but the definitive diagnosis of CTE in a living patient remains impossible without effective biomarkers for the condition, which is an active area of study.

DATA SOURCES: Nine electronic databases searched from inception to March 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials comparing exercise interventions with each other or with no exercise control for adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers evaluated eligibility and methodological quality. Main outcomes extracted were pain intensity and limitation of function. Trial sequential analysis was used to investigate reliability and conclusiveness of available evidence for exercise interventions. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to combine both direct (within trial) and indirect (between trial) evidence on treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: 60 trials (44 knee, two hip, 14 mixed) covering 12 exercise interventions and with 8218 patients met inclusion criteria. Sequential analysis showed that as of 2002 sufficient evidence had been accrued to show significant benefit of exercise interventions over no exercise control. For pain relief, strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening plus aerobic, aquatic strengthening, and aquatic strengthening plus flexibility, exercises were significantly more effective than no exercise control. A combined intervention of strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise was also significantly more effective than no exercise control for improving limitation in function (standardised mean difference -0.63, 95\% credible interval -1.16 to -0.10). CONCLUSIONS: As of 2002 sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise in patients with osteoarthritis, and further trials are unlikely to overturn this result. An approach combining exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and aerobic capacity is likely to be most effective in the management of lower limb osteoarthritis. The evidence is largely from trials in patients with knee osteoarthritis. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) No CRD42012002267.},

For decades, the conventional wisdom has been that the consumption of saturated fat (SFA) undermines cardiovascular health, clogs the arteries, increases risk of CVD, and leads to heart attacks. It is timely to investigate whether this claim holds up to scientific scrutiny. The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss recent scientific evidence on the association between dietary SFA and CVD.                                         Methods and results               PubMed, Google scholar, and Scopus were searched for articles published between 2010 and 2021 on the association between SFA consumption and CVD risk and outcomes. A review was conducted examining observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, and long-term RCTs. Collectively, neither observational studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have conclusively established a significant association between SFA in the diet and subsequent cardiovascular risk and coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or mortality nor a benefit of reducing dietary SFAs on CVD rick, events, and mortality. Beneficial effects of replacement of SFA by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat or carbohydrates remain elusive.                                         Conclusion               Findings from the studies reviewed in this paper indicate that the consumption of SFA is not significantly associated with CVD risk, events, or mortality. Based on the scientific evidence, there is no scientific ground to demonize SFA as a cause of CVD. SFA naturally occurring in nutrient-dense foods can be safely included in the diet.},

Patients with trunk trauma suffer blood loss, inflammation and hypoxia and are at risk of developing respiratory and musculoskeletal complications during their recovery. Physiotherapists are an integral part of the interprofessional team that manages patients who sustain trunk trauma. OBJECTIVES: To describe the physiotherapy management of adult patients with trunk trauma, their quality of life, post-discharge rehabilitation service provision, and outcome measures used in the physiotherapy management. METHOD: A non-systematic narrative review of published literature was performed. RESULTS: Mobilisation, functional exercises, deep breathing exercises and active coughing are used to optimise patients' respiratory and musculoskeletal functioning. Some physiotherapists educate patients on the use of pain management strategies to reduce discomfort from rib fractures, surgical sites and intercostal drainage bottle tubing. Survivors of trunk trauma experience limitations in physical function up to two years. Little is known about post-discharge rehabilitation service provision to these patients after discharge. Few physiotherapists use outcome measures as part of their daily clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Physiotherapy management of patients with blunt or penetrating trunk trauma during hospitalisation and after discharge is a field of clinical practice that is rich for high-quality research related to service provision, cost analysis and interventions used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Physiotherapy clinicians and researchers can use the findings of this review as a guide to their management of adult patients recovering from trunk trauma.},

  abstract = {Conservative non-surgical management of a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc (HLD) in athletes is a complex task due to the dramatic forces imparted on the spine during sport participation. The demands placed upon the athlete during rehabilitation and return to sport are unique not only from a sport specific perspective, but also regarding return to the sport strength and conditioning programs utilized for sport preparation. Many prescriptions fail to address postural and motor control faults specific to athletic development, which may prevent full return to sport after suffering a HLD or predispose the athlete to future exacerbations of a HLD. Strength exercises involving squatting, deadlifting, and Olympic power lifts are large components of the typical athlete's conditioning program, therefore some progressions are provided to address potential underlying problems in the athlete's technique that may have contributed to their HLD in the first place. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to propose a framework for rehabilitation that is built around the phases of healing of the disc. Phase I: Non-Rotational/Non-Flexion Phase (Acute Inflammatory Phase), Phase II: Counter rotation/Flexion Phase (Repair Phase), Phase III: Rotational Phase/Power development (Remodeling Phase), and Phase IV: Full return to sport. This clinical commentary provides a theoretical basis for these phases based on available literature as well as reviewing many popular current practice trends in the management of an HLD. The authors recognize the limits of any general exercise rehabilitation recommendation with regard to return to sport, as well as any general strength and conditioning program. It is vital that an individual assessment and prescription is made for every athlete which reviews and addresses movement in all planes of motion under all necessary extrinsic and intrinsic demands to that athlete.

RECENT FINDINGS               With a prevalence of 1\% to 3\% and substantial comorbidity, high lifetime costs, and emotional burden, intellectual developmental disorder is characterized by limitations in both intellectual functioning (IQ less than 70) and adaptive behavior starting before 18 years of age. Pinpointing the precise genetic cause is important, as it allows for accurate genetic counseling, avoidance of unnecessary testing, prognostication, and tailored  management, which, for an increasing number of genetic conditions, targets the pathophysiology and improves outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               The etiology of intellectual developmental disorder is heterogeneous, which mandates a structured approach that considers family situation, test costs, yield, and potential therapeutic tractability of the identified condition. Diagnosis of an underlying genetic cause is increasingly important with the advent of new treatments. Still, in many cases, the cause remains unknown, and research is needed to elucidate its complex molecular basis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to understand the role of skeletal maturity in the different patterns of osteochondral and ligamentous injuries after an acute lateral patellar dislocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two radiologists independently reviewed MRIs of 212 knees performed after an acute lateral patellar dislocation to evaluate the presence of high-grade patellar osteochondral injury, femoral osteochondral injury, and medial patellofemoral ligament injury. The association of skeletal maturity (indicated by a closed distal femoral physis), age, sex, and first-time versus recurrent dislocation with each of these various lesions was analyzed using Chi-square or T test, and multivariable logistic regression with estimation of odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Skeletal maturity was significantly associated with high-grade patellar osteochondral injury [OR=2.72 (95\% CI 1.00, 7.36); p=0.049] and femoral-side MPFL tear [OR=2.34 (95\% CI 1.05, 5.25); p=0.039]. Skeletal immaturity was significantly associated with patellar-side MPFL tear [OR=0.35 (95\% CI 0.14, 0.90); p=0.029]. CONCLUSION: Patterns of injury to the patella and medial patellofemoral ligament vary notably between the skeletally immature and mature, and these variations may be explained by the inherent weakness of the patellar secondary physis.},

  abstract = {Multi-copper oxidases (MCOs) are a small group of enzymes that oxidize their substrate with the concomitant reduction of dioxygen to two water molecules. Generally, multi-copper oxidases are promiscuous with regards to their reducing substrates and are capable of performing various functions in different species. To date, three multi-copper oxidases have been detected in humans--ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and zyklopen. Each of these enzymes has a high specificity towards iron with the resulting ferroxidase activity being associated with ferroportin, the only known iron exporter protein in humans. Ferroportin exports iron as Fe(2+), but transferrin, the major iron transporter protein of blood, can bind only Fe(3+) effectively. Iron oxidation in enterocytes is mediated mainly by hephaestin thus allowing dietary iron to enter the bloodstream. Zyklopen is involved in iron efflux from placental trophoblasts during iron transfer from mother to fetus. Release of iron from the liver relies on ferroportin and the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin which is found in blood in a soluble form. Ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and zyklopen show distinctive expression patterns and have unique mechanisms for regulating their expression. These features of human multi-copper ferroxidases can serve as a basis for the precise control of iron efflux in different tissues. In this manuscript, we review the biochemical and biological properties of the three human MCOs and discuss their potential roles in human iron homeostasis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The epidemiology of infectious encephalitis and brain abscess has changed in recent years. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of certain viruses associated with encephalitis, while a decrease in fulminant otogenic infections has led to fewer brain abscesses associated with otitis media. However, changes in climate and human population density and distribution have enabled the emergence of newer pathogens and expanded the geographic range of others, and greater adoption of intensive immunosuppressive regimens for autoimmune conditions has increased the risk of opportunistic infections of the brain. The widespread use of early neuroimaging, along with improved diagnostic methodologies for pathogen detection, newer antimicrobial therapies with better brain penetration, and less invasive neurosurgical techniques, has resulted in better outcomes for patients with infectious encephalitis and brain abscess. Novel technologies including metagenomic next-generation sequencing are increasingly being applied to these conditions in an effort to improve diagnosis. Nevertheless, both infectious encephalitis and brain abscess continue to be associated with substantial mortality.                                         SUMMARY               Infectious encephalitis and brain abscess can present as neurologic emergencies and require rapid assessment, thorough and appropriate diagnostic testing, and early initiation of empiric therapies directed against infectious agents. Close clinical follow-up, proper interpretation of diagnostic results, and appropriate tailoring of therapeutic agents are essential to optimizing outcomes. Diagnosis and management of parenchymal brain infections are complex and often best achieved with a multidisciplinary care team involving neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, infectious disease physicians, and pathologists.},

This article provides an overview of autonomic disorders with potential autoimmune etiology.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent evidence highlights a close association between the autonomic nervous system and inflammation. The autonomic nervous system regulates immune function, and autonomic manifestations may occur in a number of systemic autoimmune diseases. In a few instances, autoimmunity directly influences autonomic function. Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is the prototypic antibody-mediated autonomic disorder. Over time, a better understanding of the clinical spectrum of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, the significance of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies, other immune-mediated autonomic neuropathies, and autonomic manifestations of other systemic or neurologic autoimmune disorders has emerged.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Bradykinesia and muscle weaknesses are common symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and are associated with impaired functional performance, increased risk of falls, and reduced quality of life. Recent studies have pointed to progressive resistance training (PRT) as an effective method to control and reduce these symptoms, increasing possibilities to treat the disease. However, few studies have focused on assessing the PRT effects in the short-term. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the short-term PRT effects on people with PD, in order to offer new parameters for a better understanding of its effects, so as an adequation and PRT use as a complementary therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty individuals diagnosed with PD from stage 1 to 3 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale took part on the study and were allocated into 2 groups; Training Group (TG) performed a 9-week RT program twice a week, and the Control Group (CG) attended disease lectures. Bradykinesia UPDRS subscale (BSS), knee extensors isokinetic strength, Ten Meters Walk Test (TMW), Timed Up\&Go Test (TUG) and 30-Second Chair Stand (T30) were measured before and after the intervention period. Statistical significance was set at p {$\leq$} 0.05. RESULTS: Significant time was noted by the group interaction for all functional tests (TUG, T30, and TWM; all p {$<$} 0.01) and BSS (p {$<$} 0.01). Post hoc analyses revealed that these differences were driven by significant improvements in these dependent variables (all p {$<$} 0.01) while the CG remained unchanged (all p {$>$} 0.05). Moreover, TUG, T30, TWM, and BSS were significantly different between TG and CG in the post-training assessments (all p {$<$} 0.01). Isokinetic muscle strength was slightly increased in the TG (2.4\%) and decreased in the CG (-2.2\%), but statistical analyses did not reach significance for interaction but only a trend (p = 0.12). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that 9 weeks of PRT reduces bradykinesia and improves functional performance in patients with mild to moderate PD. These findings reinforce this mode of exercise as an important component of public health promotion programs for PD.},

Many anatomical variations of plantaris muscle have been reported previously, including its inconstancy. Evolutional studies strongly suggest that plantaris muscle is a rudimentary muscle that plays minor role in gait biomechanics. However, plantaris muscle seems to have very important proprioceptive role since it has very high density of muscle spindles. Clinically, plantaris muscle is involved in differential diagnosis of posterior leg pain and several pathological entities such as: plantaris muscle rupture, non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy and popliteal artery compression syndrome. Different surgical specialties have recognized plantaris muscle tendon as a valuable graft. However, literature on plantaris muscle tendon biomechanical properties is rather scant and inconsistent with several limitations for proper data comparison and interpretation. Further comparative studies are needed to properly define biomechanical properties of plantaris muscle tendon grafts for various ligament and tendon reconstructive procedures.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Adverse drug reactions are a source of significant morbidity and rising health care costs. Failure to recognize neurologic adverse drug reactions may prompt unnecessary testing to identify a primary neurologic condition and expose the patient to continued adverse effects of a medication.

SUMMARY               Early recognition of neurologic adverse medication reactions can be challenging but is essential to prompt discontinuation of the offending medication or administration of specific symptomatic treatments in select cases.

  abstract = {We investigated whether, during maximal exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow is as high as during resting hyperpnoea at the same work of breathing. We hypothesized that during exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow would be limited by competition from the locomotor muscles. Intercostal (probe over the 7th intercostal space) and vastus lateralis muscle perfusion were measured simultaneously in ten trained cyclists by near-infrared spectroscopy using indocyanine green dye. Measurements were made at several exercise intensities up to maximal (WRmax) and subsequently during resting isocapnic hyperpnoea at minute ventilation levels up to those at WRmax. During resting hyperpnoea, intercostal muscle blood flow increased linearly with the work of breathing (R2 = 0.94) to 73.0 +/- 8.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at the ventilation seen at WRmax (work of breathing approximately 550-600 J min-1), but during exercise it peaked at 80\% WRmax (53.4 +/- 10.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1), significantly falling to 24.7 +/- 5.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at WRmax. At maximal ventilation intercostal muscle vascular conductance was significantly lower during exercise (0.22 +/- 0.05 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1) compared to isocapnic hyperpnoea (0.77 +/- 0.13 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1). During exercise, both cardiac output and vastus lateralis muscle blood flow also plateaued at about 80\% WRmax (the latter at 95.4 +/- 11.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1). In conclusion, during exercise above 80\% WRmax in trained subjects, intercostal muscle blood flow and vascular conductance are less than during resting hyperpnoea at the same minute ventilation. This suggests that the circulatory system is unable to meet the demands of both locomotor and intercostal muscles during heavy exercise, requiring greater O2 extraction and likely contributing to respiratory muscle fatigue.},

The work presented here focuses mostly on testing the theory of blood flow redistribution from the locomotor to the respiratory muscles during heavy exercise in healthy participants and in patients with COPD. What advances does it highlight? Studies presented and the direct experimental approach to measure muscle blood flow by indocyanine green dye detected by near infrared spectroscopy, show that exercise interferes with respiratory muscle blood flow especially in COPD, but even in healthy. ABSTRACT: We have developed an indicator-dilution method to measure muscle blood flow at rest and during exercise using the light absorbing tracer indocyanine green dye (ICG) injected as an intravenous bolus, with surface optodes placed over muscles of interest to record the ICG signal by near-infrared spectroscopy. Here we review findings for both quadriceps and intercostal muscle blood flow (measured simultaneously) in trained cyclists and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During resting hyperpnoea in both athletes and patients, intercostal muscle blood flow increased with ventilation, correlating closely and linearly with the work of breathing, with no change in quadriceps flow. During graded exercise in athletes, intercostal flow at first increased, but then began to fall approaching peak effort. Unexpectedly, in COPD, intercostal muscle blood flow during exercise fell progressively from resting values, contrasting sharply with the response to resting hyperpnoea. During exercise at peak intensity, we found no quadriceps blood flow reduction in favour of the respiratory muscles in either athletes or patients. In COPD at peak exercise, when patients breathed 21\% oxygen in helium or 100\% oxygen, there was no redistribution of blood flow observed between legs and respiratory muscles in either direction. Evidence of decrease in leg blood flow and increase in respiratory muscle flow was found only when imposing expiratory flow limitation (EFL) during exercise in healthy individuals. However, because EFL caused substantial physiological derangement, lowering arterial oxygen saturation and raising end-tidal PCO2 and heart rate, these results cannot be projected onto normal exercise.},

This article reviews the history and physical examination features pertinent for diagnosis, differential diagnoses, and treatments and approaches for optimal control of symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Essential tremor is a syndrome with symptoms extending beyond tremor to involve disturbances in gait, speech, cognition, and mood. Although the new guidelines on the definition and biaxial classification scheme have provided clarity, some tremor experts have critiqued the recently coined term                 essential tremor plus                 . For treatment, new orthotic devices and peripheral stimulation devices are now available in addition to pharmacologic and surgical options.                                                        SUMMARY               Essential tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology with many subtleties and nuances. A detailed history with open-ended questions and focused questions encompassing medical history, social history, and family history is key for establishing the diagnosis. The presence of bilateral action tremor for 3 years and absence of isolated head and voice tremor and absence of task- and position-dependent tremor are necessary for diagnosis. Dystonic tremor, Parkinson disease tremor, physiologic tremor, and drug-induced tremor are common differential diagnoses. Differentiating these tremor disorders from essential tremor based on phenomenology and physical examination alone could be challenging; thus, clinicians should seek additional clues from a detailed history. Treatment could begin with noninvasive and nonpharmacologic therapies, especially in mild cases. As the severity increases, they can advance stepwise to include pharmacotherapies and surgical interventions. With the growing recognition that essential tremor is not a monosymptomatic disorder, management should involve a multidisciplinary team. Furthermore, treatment selection should be based on shared decision making between patients and providers that gives due consideration to severity of symptoms, level of functional disability, impact on social interactions, patient preferences, and patient expectations.},

This article reviews the phenotype and pathophysiology of the disease as well as the recent efforts in clinical outcome measures and clinical trials.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                As the name implies, FSHD involves weakness of facial muscles, muscles that fix the scapula, and muscles overlying the humerus (biceps and triceps). The distinctive phenotype of FSHD occurs secondary to two different genetic mechanisms. FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) is due to a deletion on chromosome 4q, leading to hypomethylation and derepression of                 DUX4                 . FSHD type 2 (FSHD2) is due to mutations in                 SMCHD1                 with resulting hypomethylation of the same subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and derepression of                 DUX4                 . Understanding the central role of                 DUX4                 has opened up the possibility of disease-modifying treatments. In preparation for clinical trials of novel agents, researchers are in the process of validating a number of clinical trial outcome measures including MRI, the 6-minute walk test, the FSHD Composite Outcome Measure, reachable workspace, electrical impedance myography, and the FSHD Health Index.

While past clinical trials in FSHD have been largely disappointing, novel agents in development, including antisense oligonucleotides, gene therapy, and small molecules, hold promise for future meaningful therapies.},

This article discusses an approach to the recognition and management of seizures, stroke, and cardiac arrest as complications of other critical illnesses in the pediatric intensive care unit.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures occur frequently in children after cardiac arrest or traumatic brain injury and during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Seizures may add to neurologic morbidity, and continuous EEG monitoring is needed for up to 24 hours for detection. Hypothermia has not been shown to improve outcome after cardiac arrest in children, but targeted temperature management with controlled normothermia and prevention of fever is a mainstay of neuroprotection.                                         SUMMARY               Much of brain-directed pediatric critical care is empiric. Recognition of neurologic complications of critical illness requires multidisciplinary care, serial neurologic examinations, and an appreciation for the multiple risk factors for neurologic injury present in most patients in the pediatric intensive care unit. Through attention to the fundamentals of neuroprotection, including maintaining or restoring cerebral perfusion matched to the metabolic needs of the brain, combined with anticipatory planning, these complications can be prevented or the neurologic injury mitigated.},

This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.

RECENT FINDINGS               The prevalence of MS has increased in recent decades, and costs of care for patients with MS have risen dramatically. Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals may be at risk for more severe MS-related disability. Multiple genetic MS risk factors have been identified. Factors such as low vitamin D levels and a history of Epstein-Barr virus, smoking, and obesity, especially during childhood, also influence MS risk. Traditionally thought to be a T-cell{\textendash}mediated disease, recent research has highlighted the additional roles of B cells and microglia in both relapsing and progressive MS.                                         SUMMARY               Complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors affect the risk for MS as well as the disease course. People of color have historically been underrepresented in both MS clinical trials and literature, but current research is attempting to better clarify unique considerations in these groups. MS pathology consists of the focal inflammatory lesions that have been well characterized in relapsing MS, as well as a more widespread neurodegenerative component that is posited to drive progressive disease. Recent advances in characterization of both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative aspects of MS pathophysiology have yielded potential targets for future therapeutic options.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Joint mobilizations are often quantified using a 4-point grading system based on the physiotherapist's detection of resistance. It is suggested that the initial resistance to joint mobilizations is imperceptible to physiotherapists, but that at some point through range becomes perceptible, a point termed R1. Grades of mobilization traditionally hinge around this concept and are performed either before or after R1. Physiotherapists, however, show poor reliability in applying grades of mobilization. The definition of R1 is ambiguous and dependent on the skills of the individual physiotherapist. The aim of this study is to test a revised grading system where R1 is considered at the beginning of range, and the entire range, as perceived by the physiotherapists maximum force application, is divided into three, creating 3 grades of mobilization. METHOD: Thirty-two post-registration physiotherapists and nineteen pre-registration students assessed end of range (point R2) and then applied 3 grades of AP mobilizations, over the talus, in an asymptomatic models ankle. Vertical forces were recorded through a force platform. Intra-class Correlation Coefficients, Standard Error of Measurement, and Minimal Detectable Change were calculated to explore intra-rater reliability on intra-day and inter-day testing. T-tests determined group differences. RESULTS: Intra-rater reliability was excellent for intra-day testing (ICC 0.96-0.97), and inter-day testing (ICC 0.85-0.93). No statistical difference was found between pre- and post-registration groups. DISCUSSION: Standardizing the definition of grades of mobilization, by moving R1 to the beginning of range and separating grades into thirds, results in excellent intra-rater reliability on intra-day and inter-day tests.

This article examines the evidence for using the available options.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Carotid endarterectomy is an effective treatment option for reducing the risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients. Patients should be stratified for future stroke risk based on both the degree of stenosis and the presence of symptoms referable to the culprit lesion. Carotid stenting is also useful in reducing stroke risk, again in carefully selected patients. Because of the publication of significant data regarding both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in the last several years, selection can be far more personalized and refined for individual patients based on demographics, sex, patient preference, and medical comorbidities. Routine extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery remains unproven as a therapeutic option for large vessel occlusion in reducing the incidence of ischemic stroke although some carefully screened patient populations remaining at high risk may benefit; procedural risks and pathology related to alterations in blood flow dynamics are challenges to overcome. Indirect revascularization remains an appropriate solution for carefully selected patients with cerebral large vessel steno-occlusive disease, and multiple variations of surgical technique are patient specific. Indirect revascularization may benefit from clinical trials with larger patient populations for validation in specific pathologies and offers the advantages of lower surgical complication rates and reduced risk of pathologic responses to altered cerebral flow dynamics.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate if and to what extent typical head pain can be reproduced in tension-type headache (TTH), migraine without aura sufferers, and controls when sustained pressure was applied to the lateral posterior arch of C1 and the articular pillar of C2, stressing the atlantooccipital and C2-3 segments respectively. BACKGROUND: Occipital and neck symptoms often accompany primary headache, suggesting involvement of cervical afferents in central pain processing mechanisms in these disorders. Referral of head pain from upper cervical structures is made possible by convergence of cervical and trigeminal nociceptive afferent information in the trigemino-cervical nucleus. Upper cervical segmental and C2-3 zygapophysial joint dysfunction is recognized as a potential source of noxious afferent information and is present in primary headache sufferers. Furthermore, referral of head pain has been demonstrated from symptomatic upper cervical segments and the C2-3 zygapophysial joints, suggesting that head pain referral may be a characteristic of cervical afferent involvement in headache. METHODS: Thirty-four headache sufferers and 14 controls were examined interictally. Headache patients were diagnosed according the criteria of the International Headache Society and comprised 20 migraine without aura (females n = 18; males n = 2; average age 35.3 years) and 14 TTH sufferers (females n = 11; males n = 3; average age 30.7 years). Two techniques were used specifically to stress the atlantooccipital segments (Technique 1 - C1) and C2-3 zygapophysial joints (Technique 2 - C2). Two techniques were also applied to the arm--the common extensor origin and the mid belly of the biceps brachii. Participants reported reproduction of head pain with "yes" or "no" and rated the intensity of head pain and local pressure of application on a scale of 0 -10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = intolerable pain. RESULTS: None of the subjects reported head pain during application of techniques on the arm. Head pain referral during the cervical examination was reported by 8 of 14 (57\%) control participants, all TTH patients and all but 1 migraineur (P {$<$} .002). In each case, participants reported that the referred head pain was similar to the pain they usually experienced during TTH or migraine. The frequency of head pain referral was identical for Techniques 1 and 2. The intensity of referral did not differ between Technique 1 and Technique 2 or between groups. Tenderness ratings to thumb pressure were comparable between the Techniques 1 and 2 when pressure was applied to C1 and C2 respectively and across groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences for tenderness ratings to thumb pressure between Technique 1 and Technique 2 on the arm or between groups. While tenderness ratings to thumb pressure for Technique 2 were similar for both referral (n = 41) and non-referral (n = 7) groups, tenderness ratings for Technique 1 in the referral group were significantly greater when compared with the non-referral group (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the continuum concept of headache, one in which noxious cervical afferent information may well be significantly underestimated. The high incidence of reproduction of headache supports the evaluation of musculoskeletal features in patients presenting with migrainous and TTH symptoms. This, in turn, may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of headache and developing alternative treatment options.},

As neurologic dysfunction is one of the most frequent complications of these diseases and may even be the presenting symptom, it is important to be familiar with these complications to foster early recognition and intervention.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances have been made in the identification of which patients can safely undergo valvular surgery for treatment of infective endocarditis in the setting of stroke, which, ideally, will minimize the risk of recurrent stroke in these patients. Additionally, technologic advances are improving our ability to use a multimodal approach for prognostication after cardiac arrest.                                         SUMMARY               The neurologic complications from the described disorders range from cerebrovascular complications to encephalitis, cognitive impairment, sleep-disordered breathing, headache, and increased intracranial pressure leading to coma or even death. Given the severity of these symptoms, it is paramount that neurologists be closely involved in the care of patients with neurologic complications from cardiac and pulmonary disorders.},

Articles were excluded based on established review criteria resulting in 74 studies being considered as evidence addressing one or more of the identified key issues. The identified literature was evaluated and graded using the National Academies of Science GRADE criteria. Recommendations were formulated after extensive review. Eighteen recommendations were confirmed with four having strong evidence and workgroup confidence in the recommendation. Key recommendations address patient and caregiver education, consideration for the use of rigid and semirigid dressings, consideration for the use of microprocessor knees, and managed lifetime care that includes annual transdisciplinary assessments. In conclusion, this clinical practice guideline used the best available evidence from the past 10 yrs to provide key management recommendations to enhance the quality and consistency of rehabilitation care for persons with lower limb amputation.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Sporadic IBM is the most common acquired muscle disease in patients older than 50 years of age and is becoming more prevalent because of the increasing age of the population, the emerging development of more inclusive diagnostic criteria, and the advent of a diagnostic autoantibody. No effective therapy is known, and the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. Some pathogenic insight can be gleaned from other myopathies with pathologic similarities or hereditary inclusion body myopathies. Although clinically distinct from sporadic IBM, preclinical models of hereditary inclusion body myopathy have offered an opportunity to move some therapies toward clinical development.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with sporadic IBM experience significant morbidity, and the disease is associated with a large unmet medical need. As therapies are developed, improved diagnosis will be essential. Early diagnosis relies on awareness, clinical history, physical examination, laboratory features, and appropriate muscle biopsy processing. Future research is needed to understand the natural history, identify genetic risk factors, and validate biomarkers to track disease progression. These steps are essential as we move toward therapeutic interventions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been increasingly recognized in PD and DLB, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. While PD is most associated with and diagnosed by the presence of motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms can often be the most debilitating for patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent nonmotor features and include cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, psychosis, impulse control disorders, and apathy. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can be difficult to recognize and diagnose in patients with PD, in part because of comorbidity and symptom overlap with core PD features. Treatment strategies are a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions used in the general population and those specific to PD. DLB is a clinical dementia syndrome, often with similar cognitive, behavioral, autonomic, and motor features as PD. Moreover, DLB has shared underlying pathophysiology with PD, as both are associated with postmortem findings of {$\alpha$}-synuclein neuropathology at autopsy and have shared genetic risk and prodromal symptoms. DLB is clinically differentiated from PD by the presenting features of cognitive impairment in DLB, compared with the variable onset of cognitive impairment occurring 1 year or more after established motor onset in PD. Thus, diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB are similar to that of PD and have important implications for maintaining patient independence and providing support for caregivers because motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms have an additive effect on patient functional disability.                                         SUMMARY               A careful history and physical examination are often needed to accurately diagnose and treat the heterogeneous cognitive and behavioral symptoms of PD and DLB. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in PD and DLB are important, as these are a considerable source of patient disability and caregiver burden.},

Referral questions, principles of evaluation, and common instruments to detect abnormalities in cognition and behavior in this population are reviewed. The integration of neuropsychological test findings with other clinical and biomarker information enhances early detection, differential diagnosis, and care planning.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, and, accordingly, the prevalence and incidence of dementia associated with age-related neurodegenerative brain disease are rising. Age is the greatest risk factor for the dementia associated with Alzheimer disease, the most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia in people over 65 years of age; other etiologies, such as the class of frontotemporal lobar degenerations, are increasingly recognized in individuals both younger and older than 65 years of age. The clinical dementia diagnosis, unfortunately, is imperfectly related to disease etiology; however, probabilistic relationships can aid in diagnosis. Further, mounting evidence from postmortem brain autopsies points to multiple etiologies. The case examples in this article illustrate how the neuropsychological evaluation increases diagnostic accuracy and, most important, identifies salient cognitive and behavioral symptoms to target for nonpharmacologic intervention and caregiver education and support. Sharing the diagnosis with affected individuals is also discussed with reference to prognosis and severity of illness.

  abstract = {Study Design Prospective cohort. Background The high risk of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries after return to sport highlights the importance of return-to-sport decision making. Objective return-to-sport criteria frequently use limb symmetry indexes (LSIs) to quantify quadriceps strength and hop scores. Whether using the uninvolved limb in LSIs is optimal is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the uninvolved limb as a reference standard for LSIs utilized in return-to-sport testing and its relationship with second ACL injury rates. Methods Seventy athletes completed quadriceps strength and 4 single-leg hop tests before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and 6 months after ACLR. Limb symmetry indexes for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures at 6 months. Estimated preinjury capacity (EPIC) levels for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures before ACLR. Second ACL injuries were tracked for a minimum follow-up of 2 years after ACLR. Results Forty (57.1\%) patients achieved 90\% LSIs for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Only 20 (28.6\%) patients met 90\% EPIC levels (comparing the involved limb at 6 months after ACLR to the uninvolved limb before ACLR) for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Twenty-four (34.3\%) patients who achieved 90\% LSIs for all measures 6 months after ACLR did not achieve 90\% EPIC levels for all measures. Estimated preinjury capacity levels were more sensitive than LSIs in predicting second ACL injuries (LSIs, 0.273; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010, 0.566 and EPIC, 0.818; 95\% CI: 0.523, 0.949). Conclusion Limb symmetry indexes frequently overestimate knee function after ACLR and may be related to second ACL injury risk. These findings raise concern about whether the variable ACL return-to-sport criteria utilized in current clinical practice are stringent enough to achieve safe and successful return to sport.

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed, accounting for over 200,000 cases annually. Despite the high prevalence, there is still much debate as to the optimal graft choice. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current literature and discuss the reported outcomes for the most common graft choices. RECENT FINDINGS: The most common autografts being used include bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), hamstring tendon (HT), and quadriceps tendon (QT). Hamstring tendon might have a slightly higher re-tear rate when compared with BPTB (2.84 versus 2.80). However, BPTB has a higher rate of anterior knee and kneeling pain in the short- and mid-term follow-up. This has not been shown to be the case in long-term follow-up. Allograft is a viable option for revisions and primaries in patients greater than 35~years old; however, re-tear rate increases significantly in younger patients. ACL reconstruction graft choice is a highly studied and yet still exceedingly debated topic. Most large studies report either no significant difference or a small difference in failure rate and outcome scores between the different autograft choices. Allografts have been demonstrated to have an increased risk of failure in younger athletes and should be reserved for revision cases and those aged 35~years and older. Graft choice should ultimately be decided upon based on surgeon comfort and experience and individual patient characteristics.},

Epidemiologic and neurobiological data are reviewed as well as common associated symptoms, including sleep disruption, and treatment approaches to these conditions.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD is no longer considered an anxiety-related disorder in the                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 classification and instead is associated with trauma/stressor-related disorders. PTSD symptoms are clustered into four domains including intrusive experiences, avoidance, mood, and arousal symptoms. Despite this reclassification, similarities exist in consideration of diagnosis, treatment, and comorbidities with anxiety disorders. PTSD and anxiety-related disorders are heterogeneous, which is reflected by the neural circuits involved in the genesis of symptoms that may vary across symptom domains. Treatment is likely to benefit from consideration of this heterogeneity.                              Research in animal models of fear and anxiety, as well as in humans, suggests that patients with PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder have difficulty accurately determining safety from danger and struggle to suppress fear in the presence of safety cues.               Empirically supported psychotherapies commonly involved exposure (fear extinction learning) and are recommended for PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in other anxiety-related disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used in the treatment of PTSD and anxiety disorders in which pharmacologic intervention is supported. Treating sleep disruption including sleep apnea (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]), nightmares, and insomnia (preferably via psychotherapy) may improve symptoms of PTSD, as well as improve mood in anxiety disorders.                                         SUMMARY               PTSD has a lifetime prevalence that is close to 10\% and shares neurobiological features with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental conditions and are highly comorbid with other disorders; treatment considerations typically include cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacologic intervention. Developing technologies show some promise as treatment alternatives in the future.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of several neural autoantibodies and their antigenic targets has revolutionized the investigation and treatment of immune-mediated myelopathies. Detection of these serologic biomarkers can support or establish a diagnosis of an autoimmune myelopathy, and, in the case of paraneoplastic syndromes, indicate the likely presence of an underlying malignancy. Distinctive lesion patterns detected on spinal cord or brain MRI narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with acute or subacute inflammatory myelopathies, including those not associated with autoantibody markers.                                         SUMMARY               Immune-mediated myelopathies usually present acutely or subacutely and have a broad differential diagnosis. A systematic diagnostic approach using data from the clinical setting and presentation, MRI lesion patterns, CSF data, and autoantibody markers can differentiate these disorders from noninflammatory myelopathies, often with precise disease classification. This, in turn, provides prognostic information, especially whether the disorder is likely to relapse, and facilitates therapeutic decision making. Diagnostic accuracy informs selection of acute immunotherapy aimed at arresting and reversing recent neurologic injury and, when necessary, selection of long-term treatment for prevention of disease progression or relapse.},

Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to responsive behaviors are discussed. Practical treatment strategies are applied to common behavioral symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Aggressive and agitated behavior is common in dementia. Behavioral symptoms lead to reduced quality of life and distress for both patients and caregivers. They can also lead to poor outcomes and are associated with significant financial implications for the individual and health care system. A wide range of difficult behaviors exists, with limited evidence for deciding on treatment. Clinicians should integrate the available evidence with practical and commonsense strategies to target these difficult-to-treat behaviors.                                         SUMMARY               Treating aggression and agitation in dementia is challenging. Viewing behaviors as a response to either internal or external stimuli can help guide treatment. Treatment should emphasize nonpharmacologic approaches as an initial step, using practical and commonsense strategies. Caregivers and family should be actively involved in the planning and implementation of behavioral plans. It is essential to minimize both medical and nonmedical factors that may be contributing to behaviors. When pharmacologic options are required, it is important to choose medications that will target specific behavioral goals, having both practical consideration and the best evidence in mind.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Single-site studies suggest that a 2-week program of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for patients more than 1 year after stroke who maintain some hand and wrist movement can improve upper extremity function that persists for at least 1 year. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a 2-week multisite program of CIMT vs usual and customary care on improvement in upper extremity function among patients who had a first stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Extremity Constraint Induced Therapy Evaluation (EXCITE) trial, a prospective, single-blind, randomized, multisite clinical trial conducted at 7 US academic institutions between January 2001 and January 2003. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-two individuals with predominantly ischemic stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned to receive either CIMT (n = 106; wearing a restraining mitt on the less-affected hand while engaging in repetitive task practice and behavioral shaping with the hemiplegic hand) or usual and customary care (n = 116; ranging from no treatment after concluding formal rehabilitation to pharmacologic or physiotherapeutic interventions); patients were stratified by sex, prestroke dominant side, side of stroke, and level of paretic arm function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), a measure of laboratory time and strength-based ability and quality of movement (functional ability), and the Motor Activity Log (MAL), a measure of how well and how often 30 common daily activities are performed. RESULTS: From baseline to 12 months, the CIMT group showed greater improvements than the control group in both the WMFT Performance Time (decrease in mean time from 19.3 seconds to 9.3 seconds [52\% reduction] vs from 24.0 seconds to 17.7 seconds [26\% reduction]; between-group difference, 34\% [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 12\%-51\%]; P{$<$}.001) and in the MAL Amount of Use (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.21 to 2.13 vs from 1.15 to 1.65; between-group difference, 0.43 [95\% CI, 0.05-0.80]; P{$<$}.001) and MAL Quality of Movement (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.26 to 2.23 vs 1.18 to 1.66; between-group difference, 0.48 [95\% CI, 0.13-0.84]; P{$<$}.001). The CIMT group achieved a decrease of 19.5 in self-perceived hand function difficulty (Stroke Impact Scale hand domain) vs a decrease of 10.1 for the control group (between-group difference, 9.42 [95\% CI, 0.27-18.57]; P=.05). CONCLUSION: Among patients who had a stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months, CIMT produced statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in arm motor function that persisted for at least 1 year.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons. Due to its rarity and rapidly progressive nature, studying the epidemiology of ALS is challenging, and a comprehensive picture of the global burden of this disease is lacking. The objective of this systematic review was to describe the global incidence and prevalence of ALS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to identify articles published between January 1, 2010, and May 6, 2021. Studies that were population based and reported estimates of prevalence, incidence, and/or mortality of ALS were eligible for inclusion. This study focuses on the incidence and prevalence. Quality assessment was performed using a tool developed to evaluate methodology relevant to prevalence and incidence studies. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021250559. RESULTS: This search generated 6,238 articles, of which 140 were selected for data extraction and quality assessment. Of these, 85 articles reported on the incidence and 61 on the prevalence of ALS. Incidence ranged from 0.26 per 100,000 person-years in Ecuador to 23.46 per 100,000 person-years in Japan. Point prevalence ranged from 1.57 per 100,000 in Iran to 11.80 per 100,000 in the United States. Many articles identified cases with ALS from multiple data sources. DISCUSSION: There is variation in reported incidence and prevalence estimates of ALS across the world. While registries are an important and powerful tool to quantify disease burden, such resources are not available everywhere. This results in gaps in reporting of the global epidemiology of ALS, as highlighted by the degree of variation (and quality) in estimates of incidence and prevalence reported in this review.},

The diagnosis of cervicogenic dizziness is dependent upon correlating symptoms of imbalance and dizziness with neck pain and excluding other vestibular disorders based on history, examination, and vestibular function tests. When diagnosed correctly, cervicogenic dizziness can be successfully treated using a combination of manual therapy and vestibular rehabilitation.

These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30~g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological,~muscular, cartilage,~neurological, and cardiovascular health. The present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). Dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. Furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Neoplastic myelopathies are uncommon neurologic disorders but cause significant morbidity when they occur. Primary spinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, or extradural tumors. Diffuse gliomas and ependymal tumors are the most common intramedullary tumors. Diffuse gliomas include the World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III astrocytomas, the grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas, the grade IV glioblastomas, and newly recognized pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M mutation. The majority of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas are                 IDH                 -mutant tumors, whereas only 10\% of glioblastomas are                 IDH                 -mutant. Oligodendrogliomas are typically                 IDH                 -mutant and are characterized by the molecular signature of 1p/19q codeletion. Nine distinct molecular subgroups of ependymomas have been identified based on their genetic features and location.                 NF2                 mutations are frequently found in spinal cord ependymomas. Metastatic tumors are the most common tumors of the spine and can be extradural, leptomeningeal, or, rarely, intramedullary. Extradural metastatic spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency and should be promptly diagnosed as pretreatment neurologic status dictates the posttreatment outcome.                                                        SUMMARY               Neoplastic myelopathies encompass many diagnoses ranging from benign and malignant spinal tumors to paraneoplastic syndromes heralding cancers.

  abstract = {The two functional bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), namely, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles, must work in concert to control displacement of the tibia relative to the femur for complex motions. Thus, the replacement graft(s) for a torn ACL should possess similar tension patterns. The objective of the study was to examine whether a double-bundle ACL reconstruction with the semitendinosus-gracilis autografts could replicate the tension patterns of those for the intact ACL under controlled in vitro loading conditions. By means of a robotic/universal force moment sensor (UFS) testing system, the in situ force vectors (both magnitude and direction) for the AM and PL bundles of the ACL, as well as their respective replacement grafts, were determined and compared on nine human cadaveric knees. It was found that double-bundle ACL reconstruction could closely replicate the in situ force vectors. Under a 134-N anterior tibial load, the resultant force vectors for the intact ACL and the reconstructed ACL had a difference of 5 to 11 N (p {$>$} 0.05) in magnitude and 1 to 13 degrees (p {$>$} 0.05) in direction. Whereas, under combined rotatory loads of 10-N-m valgus and 5-N-m internal tibial torques, the corresponding differences were 10 to 16 N and 4 degrees to 11 degrees, respectively. Again, there were no statistically significant differences except at 30 degrees of flexion where the force vector for the AM graft had a 15 degrees (p {$<$} 0.05) lower elevation angle than did the AM bundle.},

  abstract = {Cold water immersion (CWI) is very popular as a method reducing post-exercise muscle stiffness, eliminating fatigue, decreasing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), and recovering sports performance. However, there are conflicting opinions as to whether CWI functions positively or negatively. The mechanisms of CWI are still not clear. In this systematic review, we used meta-analysis aims to examine the effect of CWI on fatigue recovery after high-intensity exercise and exercise performance. A total of 20 studies were retrieved and included from PubMed, PEDro and Elsevier databases in this review. Publication years of articles ranged from 2002 to 2022. In selected studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Crossover design (COD). Analyses of subjective indicators such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and objective indicators such as countermovement jump (CMJ) and blood plasma markers including creatine kinase(CK), lactate/lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), C-reactive protein(CRP), and IL-6 were performed. Pooled data showed as follows: CWI resulted in a significant decline in subjective characteristics (delayed-onset muscle soreness and perceived exertion at 0~h); CWI reduced countermovement jump(CMJ) significantly at 0 h, creatine kinase(CK) was lowered at 24 h, and lactate at 24 and 48~h. There was no evidence that CWI affects C-reactive protein(CRP) and IL-6 during a 48-h recovery period. Subgroup analysis revealed that different CWI sites and water temperatures have no effect on post-exercise fatigue recovery. Recommended athletes immersed in cold water immediately after exercise, which can effectively reduce muscle soreness and accelerate fatigue recovery.},

Prompt diagnosis of the underlying mechanism may improve secondary prevention strategies. This article reviews recent randomized trials, observational studies, case reports, and guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of cardioembolic stroke.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Several pathologies can lead to cardioembolic stroke, including atrial fibrillation, aortic arch atheroma, patent foramen ovale, left ventricular dysfunction, and many others. Secondary stroke prevention strategies differ across these heterogeneous mechanisms. In addition to medical treatment advances such as the use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, surgical treatments such as closure of patent foramen ovale have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in select patients. Furthermore, left atrial appendage occlusion is a promising strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation who are candidates for short-term oral anticoagulation therapy but not long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to determine cardioembolic causes of stroke. In addition to risk factor management and lifestyle modifications, identification and targeting of the underlying cardioembolic stroke mechanisms will lead to improved stroke prevention strategies in patients with cardioembolic stroke.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of dietary fiber intake on constipation by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to October 2011), Cochrane Library (2011), PubMed for articles on dietary fiber intake and constipation using the terms: constipation, fiber, cellulose, plant extracts, cereals, bran, psyllium, or plantago. References of important articles were searched manually for relevant studies. Articles were eligible for the meta-analysis if they were high-quality RCTs and reported data on stool frequency, stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and gastrointestinal symptoms. The data were extracted independently by two researchers (Yang J and Wang HP) according to the described selection criteria. Review manager version 5 software was used for analysis and test. Weighted mean difference with 95\%CI was used for quantitative data, odds ratio (OR) with 95\%CI was used for dichotomous data. Both I(2) statistic with a cut-off of {$\geq$} 50\% and the {$\chi$}(2) test with a P value {$<$} 0.10 were used to define a significant degree of heterogeneity. RESULTS: We searched 1322 potential relevant articles, 19 of which were retrieved for further assessment, 14 studies were excluded for various reasons, five studies were included in the analysis. Dietary fiber showed significant advantage over placebo in stool frequency (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05). There was no significant difference in stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation between the two groups. Stool frequency were reported by five RCTs, all results showed either a trend or a significant difference in favor of the treatment group, number of stools per week increased in treatment group than in placebo group (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05), with no significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2)= 0, P = 0.77). Four studies evaluated stool consistency, one of them presented outcome in terms of percentage of hard stool, which was different from others, so we included the other three studies for analysis. Two studies reported treatment success. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P {$<$} 0.1, I(2) {$>$} 50\%). Three studies reported laxative use, quantitative data was shown in one study, and the pooled analysis of the other two studies showed no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups in laxative use (OR = 1.07; 95\%CI 0.51-2.25), and no heterogeneity was found (P = 0.84, I(2)= 0). Three studies evaluated painful defecation: one study presented both quantitative and dichotomous data, the other two studies reported quantitative and dichotomous data separately. We used dichotomous data for analysis. CONCLUSION: Dietary fiber intake can obviously increase stool frequency in patients with constipation. It does not obviously improve stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation.},

With advances in surgical techniques providing better positioning and fixation of the graft, subsequent graft failure to certain extent should be accounted by poor graft healing. Although different biological modulations for enhancement of graft healing have been tried in different clinical and animal studies, complete graft incorporation into bone tunnels and the "ligamentization" of the intra-articular part have not been fully achieved yet. Based on the understanding of graft healing process and its failure mechanism, the purpose of this review is to combine both the known basic science \& clinical evidence, to provide a much clearer picture of the obstacle encountered in graft healing, so as to facilitate researchers on subsequent work on the enhancement of ACL graft healing.},

  abstract = {Fe deficiency is a prevalent nutritional disease, and fatigue is a common complaint in the general and patient population. The association between Fe deficiency without anaemia (IDNA) and fatigue is unclear. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Fe on fatigue in patients with IDNA and the association between IDNA and fatigue in the population. Articles from the PubMed database up to 19 January 2016 were systematically searched. A total of six relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) and six relevant cross-sectional studies were identified. All outcomes were converted into effect sizes. In the meta-analysis of the six RCT, we identified a significant therapeutic effect of Fe in fatigue patients with IDNA (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}33; 95 \% CI 0{$\cdot$}17, 0{$\cdot$}48; I 2=0{$\cdot$}0 \%; P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. significant association) were robust. In the meta-analysis of the six cross-sectional studies, the association between IDNA and fatigue was not significant (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}10; 95 \% CI -0{$\cdot$}11, 0{$\cdot$}31; I 2=57{$\cdot$}4 \%; P=0{$\cdot$}362). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. no significant association) were not robust; removal of one study made the outcomes significant. These meta-analyses suggest that improving Fe status may decrease fatigue. Further research is necessary to identify diagnostic criteria for selecting fatigue patients who might benefit from Fe therapy and to assess the prevalence of IDNA with fatigue in the general population.},

AIM: We examined the association between meat intake and life expectancy at a population level based on ecological data published by the United Nations agencies. METHODS: Population-specific data were obtained from 175 countries/territories. Scatter plots, bivariate, partial correlation and linear regression models were used with SPSS 25 to explore and compare the correlations between newborn life expectancy (e(0)), life expectancy at 5 years of life (e(5)) and intakes of meat, and carbohydrate crops, respectively. The established risk factors to life expectancy - caloric intake, urbanization, obesity and education levels - were included as the potential confounders. RESULTS: Worldwide, bivariate correlation analyses revealed that meat intake is positively correlated with life expectancies. This relationship remained significant when influences of caloric intake, urbanization, obesity, education and carbohydrate crops were statistically controlled. Stepwise linear regression selected meat intake, not carbohydrate crops, as one of the significant predictors of life expectancy. In contrast, carbohydrate crops showed weak and negative correlation with life expectancy. CONCLUSION: If meat intake is not incorporated into nutrition science for predicting human life expectancy, results could prove inaccurate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliability of measurements is a prerequisite of medical research. For nominal data, Fleiss' kappa (in the following labelled as Fleiss' K) and Krippendorff's alpha provide the highest flexibility of the available reliability measures with respect to number of raters and categories. Our aim was to investigate which measures and which confidence intervals provide the best statistical properties for the assessment of inter-rater reliability in different situations. METHODS: We performed a large simulation study to investigate the precision of the estimates for Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha and to determine the empirical coverage probability of the corresponding confidence intervals (asymptotic for Fleiss' K and bootstrap for both measures). Furthermore, we compared measures and confidence intervals in a real world case study. RESULTS: Point estimates of Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha did not differ from each other in all scenarios. In the case of missing data (completely at random), Krippendorff's alpha provided stable estimates, while the complete case analysis approach for Fleiss' K led to biased estimates. For shifted null hypotheses, the coverage probability of the asymptotic confidence interval for Fleiss' K was low, while the bootstrap confidence intervals for both measures provided a coverage probability close to the theoretical one. CONCLUSIONS: Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha with bootstrap confidence intervals are equally suitable for the analysis of reliability of complete nominal data. The asymptotic confidence interval for Fleiss' K should not be used. In the case of missing data or data or higher than nominal order, Krippendorff's alpha is recommended. Together with this article, we provide an R-script for calculating Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha and their corresponding bootstrap confidence intervals.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The onset of OA is affected by a variety of factors, which eventually lead to the loss of cartilage in the joints, the formation of osteophytes, the loss of normal knee mobility, and pain and discomfort, which seriously affects the quality of life. HUC-MSCs can promote cartilage production and have been widely used in research in the past decade. This article systematically summarizes that it is well used in basic research and clinical studies to promote inflammatory chondrogenesis in the treatment of OA. Provide a theoretical basis for clinical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study collected CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, and articles related to the treatment of OA with HUC-MSCs since their publication, excluding non-basic and clinical studies such as reviews and meta-analysis. A total of 31 basic experimental studies and 12 clinical studies were included. Systematically analyze the effects of HUC-MSCs on inhibiting inflammatory factors, promoting chondrocyte production, and current clinical treatment. RESULTS: HUC-MSCs can reduce inflammatory factors such as MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$}, induced conversion from M1 to M2 in OA to protect cartilage damage and reduce OA inflammation. Synthesize ColII, SOX9, and aggrecan at the same time to promote cartilage synthesis. CONCLUSION: HUC-MSCs not only have typical stem cell biological characteristics, but also have rich sources and convenient material extraction. Compared with stem cells from other sources, HUC-MSCs have stronger proliferation, differentiation, and immune regulation abilities. Furthermore, there are no ethical issues associated with their use. SAFETY: Primarily attributed to pain, the majority of individuals experience recovery within 24~h following injection. HUC-MSCs possess the ability to alleviate pain, enhance knee joint function, and potentially postpone the need for surgical intervention in both non-surgical and other cases, making them highly deserving of clinical promotion and application.},

Several medications have been shown to be effective in treating neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, and these medications are often used to treat neuropathic pain associated with other conditions as well. This article summarizes the diagnosis and assessment of patients with neuropathic pain as well as available pharmacologic and interventional treatment options.                                         Recent Findings:               Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain have been published, and first-line medications include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, topical agents, as well as opioid analgesics. Interventional options include anesthetic and steroid injections, nerve blocks, and spinal cord stimulation. Essential to the treatment algorithm of neuropathic pain is the assessment and treatment of psychosocial comorbidities and the utilization of a multidisciplinary team approach, including cognitive-behavioral and rehabilitative therapies. Questions remain about the comparative effectiveness of various medications and combination therapies. Increasing interest also exists in the optimization and personalization of pharmacotherapy based upon the underlying mechanism(s) of neuropathic pain according to the quality of the patient's symptoms.                                         Summary:               The management of chronic neuropathic pain is challenging and is best achieved with the use of a multidisciplinary team. Pain is a subjective experience, and it is important to validate a patient's pain, address psychosocial comorbidities, and set realistic treatment goals. Evidence-based guidelines are available to guide treatment, but frequently, high-quality evidence-based recommendations are lacking.},

  abstract = {"The third edition of Manual of Traumatic Brain Injury offers a thorough revision of the popular evidence-based guide to understanding and managing all levels of traumatic brain injury. Comprehensive in scope and concise in format, this reference describes the spectrum of injury from mild to severe and the continuum of care from initial injury to management of chronic sequelae. Chapters are designed with a practical clinical focus, for targeted retrieval of content by topic area and self-review. The text is organized into five sections. Part I addresses fundamental concepts necessary for understanding the underpinning of clinical decision-making. Part II is dedicated to mild TBI, including sport-related concussion, with chapters covering topics from natural history to associated somatic disorders, post-concussion syndrome, and PTSD. Part III covers moderate to severe TBI and details prehospital emergency and ICU care, rehabilitation, treatment of related conditions, and postinjury outcomes. Part IV focuses on TBI-related complications, including posttraumatic seizures, spasticity, behavioral and sleep disturbances, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Part V reviews special considerations in selected populations such as pediatric TBI and TBI in the military, as well as medicolegal and ethical considerations in TBI, complementary and alternative medicine, and return to work considerations. Each chapter includes boxed Key Points which underscore major clinical takeaways, Study Questions to facilitate self-assessment and further emphasize core chapter content, and an Additional Reading list for a deeper dive into chapter concepts. Significant updates incorporating recent advancements in the field, combined with the clinical acumen of its experienced contributors, make this third edition the essential manual for healthcare professionals caring for individuals with traumatic brain injury"--},

  abstract = {Increasing numbers of people are playing golf. Golf is a unique sport in that the ability to participate at a high level is not limited by age. In addition, participants tend to play more rather than less as they grow older. Injuries can occur at any point during the golf swing, from takeaway through follow-through. Upper extremity injuries can affect the hands, elbow, and shoulder and are usually a result of the golf swing at impact. Injuries are also common in the lower back as well as the lower extremities. Most injuries are the result of overuse and poor swing mechanics. When treating golfers, it is important to have a good understanding of the biomechanics and forces of the golf swing to diagnose and manage the vast spectrum of injuries incurred in this sport.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article details the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB), provides guidance for diagnostic imaging and CSF testing, and recommends treatment strategies for tuberculous meningitis and other forms of CNS TB, illustrating key aspects of diagnosis and management with case presentations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Although improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of CNS TB have occurred over the past 50 years, the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB, the advent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the subsequent availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy that can produce the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome have complicated the diagnosis and treatment of CNS TB. Advances in diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis as well as the percentage of people with a confirmed rather than a presumptive diagnosis. Advances in precision medicine have identified polymorphisms in the                 LTA4H                 gene that influence the risk for inflammation in patients with tuberculous meningitis.                                                        SUMMARY               CNS TB continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with the majority of people affected living in low-income and middle-income countries. Newer diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis and improve appropriate selection of antituberculous therapy and anti-inflammatory medications. Despite these advances, CNS TB remains difficult to diagnose, and clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating empiric therapy in patients with presumptive infection.},
