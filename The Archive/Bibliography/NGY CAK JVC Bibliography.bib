  abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most debilitating problems for humans. About 6 months after the initial injury, a cascade of secondary cellular and molecular events occurs and the primary damage enters the chronic phase. Current treatments are not curative. One of the new treatment methods is the use of cell therapy, which is gradually being tested in clinical trials to improve the symptoms of SCI patients. In this review article, we investigated the effect of different cell therapy trials in improving patients' symptoms and their paraclinical indicators. In the 72 final reviewed studies with 1144 cases and 186 controls, 20 scores were recorded as outcomes. We categorized the scores into seven groups. In upper extremity motor score, daily living function, trunk stability, postural hypotension, somatosensory evoked potential, and motor evoked potential scores, the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell therapy had a more healing effect. In the International Association of Neurorestoratology SCI Functional Rating Scale, light touch score, bowel function, decreased spasticity, Visual Analog Scale, and electromyography scores, the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell had more impact. The olfactory ensheathing cell had a greater effect on lower extremity motor score and pinprick scores than other cells. The embryonic stem cell had the greatest effect in improving the important score of the American Spinal Injury Association scale. Based on the obtained results, it seems that a special cell should be used to improve each symptom of patients with chronic SCI, and if the improvement of several harms is involved, the combination of cells may be effective.},

RECENT FINDINGS               In the past decade, the recognition of leukodystrophies has exponentially increased, and now this class includes more than 30 distinct disorders. Classically recognized as progressive and fatal disorders affecting young children, it is now understood that leukodystrophies are associated with an increasing spectrum of neurologic trajectories and can affect all ages. Next-generation sequencing and newborn screening allow the opportunity for the recognition of presymptomatic and atypical cases. These new testing opportunities, in combination with growing numbers of natural history studies and clinical consensus guidelines, have helped improve diagnosis and clinical care. Additionally, a more granular understanding of disease outcomes informs clinical trial design and has led to several recent therapeutic advances. This review summarizes the current understanding of the clinical manifestations of disease and treatment options for the most common leukodystrophies.                                         SUMMARY               As early testing becomes more readily available through next-generation sequencing and newborn screening, neurologists will better understand the true incidence of the leukodystrophies and be able to diagnose children within the therapeutic window. As targeted therapies are developed, it becomes increasingly imperative that this broad spectrum of disorders is recognized and diagnosed. This work summarizes key advances in the leukodystrophy field.},

  abstract = {Caffeine is a commonly used neurostimulant that also produces cerebral vasoconstriction by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Chronic caffeine use results in an adaptation of the vascular adenosine receptor system presumably to compensate for the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine. We investigated the effects of caffeine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in increasing levels of chronic caffeine use. Low (mean = 45 mg/day), moderate (mean = 405 mg/day), and high (mean = 950 mg/day) caffeine users underwent quantitative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging on four separate occasions: twice in a caffeine abstinent state (abstained state) and twice in a caffeinated state following their normal caffeine use (native state). In each state, there were two drug conditions: participants received either caffeine (250 mg) or placebo. Gray matter CBF was tested with repeated-measures analysis of variance using caffeine use as a between-subjects factor, and correlational analyses were conducted between CBF and caffeine use. Caffeine reduced CBF by an average of 27\% across both caffeine states. In the abstained placebo condition, moderate and high users had similarly greater CBF than low users; but in the native placebo condition, the high users had a trend towards less CBF than the low and moderate users. Our results suggest a limited ability of the cerebrovascular adenosine system to compensate for high amounts of daily caffeine use.},

Mechanical factors are the most common etiology of heel pain. Common causes of hell pain includes: Plantar Fasciitis, Heel Spur, Sever's Disease, Heel bump, Achilles Tendinopathy, Heel neuritis, Heel bursitis. The diagnosis is mostly based on clinical examination. Normally, the location of the pain and the absence of associated symptoms indicating a systemic disease strongly suggest the diagnosis. Several therapies exist including rest, physical therapy, stretching, and change in footwear, arch supports, orthotics, night splints, anti-inflammatory agents, and surgery. Almost all patients respond to conservative nonsurgical therapy. Surgery is the last treatment option if all other treatments had failed. Rest, ice, massage, the use of correct exercise and complying with a doctor's advice all play important part in helping to recover from this hell pain condition, but getting good quality, suitable shoes with the appropriate amount of support for the whole foot is the most important.},

Every person with migraine requires treatment for acute attacks. Treatments can range from behavioral management and nonspecific medications to migraine-specific medications and neuromodulation. For many with migraine, having a combination of tools allows for effective treatment of all types of attacks.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past several years, four neuromodulation devices have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of acute migraine, and three medications with novel mechanisms of action have been FDA approved. They add to the arsenal available to people with migraine and focus on migraine-specific pathways to allow for precise care with fewer side effects.

  abstract = {The sensitivity and specificity of a test cannot be used to estimate probability of disease in individual patients. They can, however, be combined into a single measure called the likelihood ratio which is, clinically, more useful than sensitivity or specificity. Likelihood ratios provide a summary of how many times more (or less) likely patients with a disease are to have a particular result than patients without the disease. Using the principles of the Bayes theorem, likelihood ratios can be used in conjunction with pre-test probability of disease to estimate an individual's post-test probability of disease, that is his or her chance of having disease once the result of a test is known. The Fagan's nomogram is a graphical tool which, in routine clinical practice, allows one to combine the likelihood ratio of a test with a patient's pre-test probability of disease to estimate post-test probability. CONCLUSION: Likelihood ratios summarize information about a diagnostic test by combining sensitivity and specificity. The Fagan's nomogram is a useful and convenient graphical tool that allows likelihood ratios to be used in conjunction with a patient's pre-test probability of disease to estimate the post-test probability of disease.},

In healthy subjects, dextrose elevated PGL at 1 (53\%) and 2 (3\%) hours, and decreased PGL after 3 hours (20\%). Honey elevated PGL after 1 hour (14\%) and decreased it after 3 hours (10\%). Elevation of insulin and C-peptide was significantly higher after dextrose than after honey. Dextrose slightly reduced cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) after 1 hour and significantly after 2 hours, and increased TG after 1, 2, and 3 hours. Artificial honey slightly decreased cholesterol and LDL-C and elevated TG. Honey reduced cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG and slightly elevated high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Honey consumed for 15 days decreased cholesterol (7\%), LDL-C (1\%), TG (2\%), CRP (7\%), homocysteine (6\%), and PGL (6\%), and increased HDL-C (2\%). In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, artificial honey increased TG, while honey decreased TG. In patients with hyperlipidemia, artificial honey increased LDL-C, while honey decreased LDL-C. Honey decreased cholesterol (8\%), LDL-C (11\%), and CRP (75\%) after 15 days. In diabetic patients, honey compared with dextrose caused a significantly lower rise of PGL. Elevation of PGL was greater after honey than after sucrose at 30 minutes, and was lower after honey than it was after sucrose at 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Honey caused greater elevation of insulin than sucrose did after 30, 120, and 180 minutes. Honey reduces blood lipids, homocysteine, and CRP in normal and hyperlipidemic subjects.

DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Soccer players of any age, sex or competition level. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental intervention was an injury prevention program that included balance training exercises. The control intervention was the soccer team's usual warm-up program. OUTCOME MEASURES: Exposure-based ankle injury rates. RESULTS: Nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled results of injury prevention programs that included balance training exercises among 4,959 soccer players showed a 36\% reduction in ankle injury per 1,000 hours of exposure compared to the control group with an injury risk ratio (IRR) of 0.64 (95\% CI 0.54 to 0.77).

  abstract = {Background Football is a highly competitive sport, and participants can experience various contact and non-contact sports injuries in the sporting process. In any elite sport, screening players using different scientific tools is an important injury prevention strategy. The Y- Balance test (YBT) was found to be a predictive tool for non-contact injury. However, the use of criteria from these tests to predict injuries has not been substantiated and should be further investigated. Purpose The aim~of this study was to determine the predictors for injury among athletes using baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; the cutoff scores for predictors of injury, including baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; and~the clinical prediction rules for predicting injury in this population. Methods A total of 39 young student football players were included in this study. The mean age was 20.28 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.83 kg/m2. A baseline assessment of the participant's characteristics was taken and each participant performed the YBT once before starting the league. After the university league football players had finished their tournament, we asked them questions related to non-contact injuries. Results The results showed that the prevalence of injury was 17.95\% among this population. An increase in the YBT score was significantly associated with a decrease in the odds of having an injury [odds ratio (OR) 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 (0.88, 0.99), p = 0.047). In addition, the number of matches was significantly associated with an increase in the odds of having an injury p = 0.012. However, the minutes of physical activity were not statistically significant p = 0.065.~The highest Youden index was {$\leq$}97.89, with a sensitivity of 87.50\% and specificity of 71.43\%, for the posterior medial reach and {$\leq$}92.88, with a sensitivity of 90.62\% and specificity of 57.14\%, for the posterior lateral reach.~The clinical prediction rule was an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. Conclusions The results of the study provide evidence for the potential utility of the YBT as a predictor tool for evaluating non-contact injuries in university league football players. By identifying players with lower YBT scores who were at higher risk for injury, targeted interventions could be implemented to address functional movement deficits and potentially reduce injury risk.},

  abstract = {Background Football is a highly competitive sport, and participants can experience various contact and non-contact sports injuries in the sporting process. In any elite sport, screening players using different scientific tools is an important injury prevention strategy. The Y- Balance test (YBT) was found to be a predictive tool for non-contact injury. However, the use of criteria from these tests to predict injuries has not been substantiated and should be further investigated. Purpose The aim~of this study was to determine the predictors for injury among athletes using baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; the cutoff scores for predictors of injury, including baseline YBT, number of matches, and minutes of physical activity; and~the clinical prediction rules for predicting injury in this population. Methods A total of 39 young student football players were included in this study. The mean age was 20.28 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.83 kg/m2. A baseline assessment of the participant's characteristics was taken and each participant performed the YBT once before starting the league. After the university league football players had finished their tournament, we asked them questions related to non-contact injuries. Results The results showed that the prevalence of injury was 17.95\% among this population. An increase in the YBT score was significantly associated with a decrease in the odds of having an injury [odds ratio (OR) 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 (0.88, 0.99), p = 0.047). In addition, the number of matches was significantly associated with an increase in the odds of having an injury p = 0.012. However, the minutes of physical activity were not statistically significant p = 0.065.~The highest Youden index was {$\leq$}97.89, with a sensitivity of 87.50\% and specificity of 71.43\%, for the posterior medial reach and {$\leq$}92.88, with a sensitivity of 90.62\% and specificity of 57.14\%, for the posterior lateral reach.~The clinical prediction rule was an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88. Conclusions The results of the study provide evidence for the potential utility of the YBT as a predictor tool for evaluating non-contact injuries in university league football players. By identifying players with lower YBT scores who were at higher risk for injury, targeted interventions could be implemented to address functional movement deficits and potentially reduce injury risk.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To identify statistical errors and pitfalls in dissertations performed as part of the requirements for the Medical Doctorate (MD) degree at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University (CU) to improve the quality of medical research. Methods: A critical assessment of 62 MD dissertations conducted in 3 departments at NCI, CU, between 2009 and 2013 was carried out regarding statistical methodology and presentation of the results. To detect differences in study characteristics over time, grouping was into two periods; 2009-2010 and 2011-2013. Results: Statistical methods were appropriate in only 13 studies (24.5\%). The most common statistical tests applied were chi-square, log-rank, and Mann-Whitney tests. Four studies estimated sample size and/or power. Only 37.1\% and 38.7\% of dissertation results supported aims and answered the research questions, respectively. Most of results were misinterpreted (82.3\%) with misuse of statistical terminology (77.4\%). Tabular and graphical data display was independently informative in only 36 dissertations (58.1\%) with accurate titles and labels in only 17 (27.4\%). Statistical tests fulfilled the assumptions only in 29 studies; with evident misuse in 33. Ten dissertations reported non-significance regarding their primary outcome measure; the median power of the test was 35.5\% (range: 6-60\%). There was no significant change in the characteristics between the time periods. Conclusion: MD dissertations at NCI have many epidemiological and statistical defects that may compromise the external validity of the results. It is recommended to involve a biostatistician from the very start to improve study design, sample size calculation, end points estimation and measures.},

  abstract = {Swimming has become a popular recreational activity as well as a highly competitive sport in the United States. The repetitive nature of swimming can predispose the shoulder to mechanical impingement and microtrauma, which may lead to laxity, rotator cuff fatigue, and subsequent secondary impingement. Improper stroke mechanics can place the swimmer's shoulder at further risk. The purpose of this paper is to describe the pathology of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers and to discuss the clinical implications for rehabilitation of swimmers with the pathology. A thorough subjective and objective evaluation is necessary to design a successful rehabilitation program. The rehabilitation program for swimmers with secondary impingement includes modification of training, flexibility, range of motion, strengthening, and mobilization as indicated. Functional and proprioceptive training may also be useful techniques in the rehabilitation of swimmer's shoulder. Improper stroke mechanics can also have clinical implications on swimmer's shoulders with secondary impingement. The clinical implication of secondary impingement in freestyle swimmers suggests that the primary goal of rehabilitation is to promote equilibrium of the shoulder complex while accounting for the demands of the sport.},

Recent Findings:               Advances in clinical phenotyping and outcomes assessment have enabled neurologists to improve disease recognition, treatment, and disease monitoring. Our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of demyelinating neuropathies is evolving. Identification of new antibodies and recognition that node of Ranvier dysfunction may be an early pathogenic feature may herald further diagnostic and treatment advancements.                                         Summary:               The chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies are heterogeneous. The clinical and diagnostic features are sometimes overlapping, and the specific disorders are variable in pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis.

It discusses the importance of diagnosing and detecting progression early, the similarities between progressive forms, challenges in detecting progression, factors that could augment progression, and the importance of disease-modifying therapies in patients with evidence of active progressive MS. It also discusses the overall care of progressive MS.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               The pathogenesis of primary progressive MS and secondary progressive MS is overlapping, and in both presentations, patients with relapses or focal MRI activity are classified as having active, progressive MS. All currently approved disease-modifying therapies are indicated for active secondary progressive MS. The therapeutic opportunity of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of progressive MS is enhanced in those who are younger and have a shorter disease duration. Vascular comorbidities may contribute to progression in MS.                                         SUMMARY               Several challenges remain in the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of progressive MS. Early identification of active progressive MS is needed to maximize treatment benefit. The advantages of optimal comorbidity management (eg, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) in delaying progression are uncertain. Clinical care guidelines for advanced, severe MS are lacking.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Arterial ischemic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are increasingly recognized in childhood as important causes of lifelong morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke is frequently delayed, as acute neurologic deficits can be challenging to detect in the young child, and stroke is often not considered in the differential diagnosis. Neurologic sequelae following stroke are common, and strategies to minimize stroke size and optimize recovery are being developed. Recurrent arterial ischemic stroke is not uncommon, particularly in children with cerebral arteriopathy. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis causes obstruction of venous outflow leading to venous infarcts. Complications include hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts and increased intracranial pressure. Without treatment, thrombus extension with increased symptoms is common. Robust guidelines of care that exist for adults do not exist for children, particularly for children with arterial ischemic stroke.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to stroke in infants and children can be informed by clinical experience in pediatric stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, the extensive literature on pediatric thrombosis, and extrapolation from data from adult patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inspiratory muscle training (IMT)~aims to improve respiratory muscle strength and endurance.~Clinical trials used various training protocols,~devices and respiratory measurements to check the effectiveness of this intervention. The current guidelines reported a possible advantage of IMT, particularly in people with respiratory muscle weakness. However, it remains unclear to what extent IMT~is clinically beneficial, especially when associated with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). ~ OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) EBSCO, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 20 October 2021.~We also checked reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IMT in combination with PR versus PR alone and IMT versus control/sham.~We included different types of IMT irrespective of the mode of delivery.~We~excluded~trials that used~resistive devices without controlling the breathing pattern or a training load of less than 30\% of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methods recommended by Cochrane including assessment of risk of bias with RoB 2. Our primary outcomes were dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life.~ MAIN RESULTS: We included 55 RCTs in this review. Both IMT and PR protocols varied significantly across the trials, especially in training duration, loads, devices, number/ frequency of sessions and the PR programs. Only eight trials were at low risk of bias. PR+IMT versus PR We included 22 trials (1446 participants) in this comparison. Based on a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of -1 unit, we did not find an improvement in dyspnea assessed with the~Borg scale~at submaximal exercise capacity (mean difference (MD) 0.19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.42 to 0.79; 2 RCTs, 202 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). ~ We also found no improvement in dyspnea assessed with themodified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC) according to an MCID between -0.5 and -1 unit (MD -0.12, 95\% CI -0.39 to 0.14; 2 RCTs, 204 participants; very low-certainty evidence).~ Pooling evidence for the~6-minute walk distance (6MWD)~showed~an increase of 5.95 meters~(95\% CI -5.73~to 17.63; 12 RCTs, 1199 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and failed to reach the~MCID of 26 meters. In subgroup analysis, we divided the RCTs according to the training duration and mean baseline PImax. The test for subgroup differences was not significant. Trials at low risk of bias (n = 3) demonstrated a larger effect estimate than the overall. The summary effect of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) revealed an overall~total score below the MCID of 4 units (MD 0.13, 95\% CI -0.93 to 1.20; 7 RCTs, 908 participants; low-certainty evidence).~ The summary effect of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) did not show an improvement in the HRQoL (MD 0.13, 95\% CI -0.80 to 1.06; 2 RCTs, 657 participants; very low-certainty evidence), according to an MCID of -1.6 units.~ Pooling the RCTs that reported PImax showed an increase of 11.46 cmH2O (95\% CI 7.42 to 15.50; 17 RCTs, 1329 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but failed to reach the MCID of 17.2 cmH2O. ~In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.~ One abstract reported some adverse effects that were considered "minor and self-limited". IMT versus control/sham Thirty-seven~RCTs with 1021 participants contributed to our second comparison. There was a trend towards an improvement when Borg was calculated~at submaximal exercise capacity~(MD -0.94, 95\% CI -1.36 to -0.51; 6 RCTs, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Only one trial was at a low risk of bias. Eight studies (nine arms) used the Baseline Dyspnea Index - Transition Dyspnea Index (BDI-TDI).~Based on an MCID of +1 unit, they~showed an improvement only with the 'total score' of the TDI (MD 2.98, 95\% CI 2.07 to 3.89; 8 RCTs, 238 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We~did not find a difference between studies classified as with and without respiratory muscle weakness. Only one trial was at low risk of bias. Four studies reported the mMRC, revealing a possible~improvement in dyspnea~in the IMT group~(MD -0.59, 95\% CI -0.76 to -0.43; 4 RCTs, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two trials were at low risk of bias. Compared to control/sham, the MD in the 6MWD following IMT was 35.71 (95\% CI 25.68~to 45.74; 16 RCTs, 501 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Two studies were at low risk of bias. In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness.~ Six studies reported theSGRQ total score, showing a larger effect in the IMT~group~(MD -3.85, 95\% CI -8.18 to 0.48; 6 RCTs, 182 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The lower limit of the 95\% CI exceeded the MCID of -4 units. Only one study was at low risk of bias. There was an improvement in life quality with CAT (MD -2.97, 95\% CI -3.85 to -2.10; 2 RCTs, 86 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). One trial was at low risk of bias. Thirty-two RCTs reported PImax, showing an improvement without reaching the MCID (MD 14.57 cmH2O, 95\% CI 9.85 to 19.29; 32 RCTs, 916 participants; low-certainty evidence). In subgroup analysis, we did not find a difference between different training durations and between studies judged with and without respiratory muscle weakness. ~ None of the included RCTs reported adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: IMT may not~improve dyspnea, functional exercise capacity and life quality when associated with PR. However, IMT is likely to improve these outcomes when provided alone. For both interventions, a larger effect in participants with respiratory muscle weakness and with longer training durations is still to be confirmed.},

These therapies predispose patients to particular infections, some of which may affect the nervous system. Therefore, familiarity with the clinical and radiologic features of neurologic infections associated with specific immunomodulatory therapies is of importance for the practicing neurologist. This article reviews these neuroinfectious conditions, as well as other neurologic complications unique to transplant recipients and other patients who are immunocompromised.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Diagnosis of infectious pathogens in patients who are immunocompromised may be particularly challenging because a decreased immune response can lead to atypical imaging or laboratory findings. Next-generation sequencing and other novel diagnostic modalities may improve the rate of early identification of neurologic infections in patients who are immunocompromised and ultimately ameliorate outcomes in this vulnerable population.                                         SUMMARY               A broad range of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections of the nervous system can complicate solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation as well as other forms of immunocompromise. In addition to neurologic infections, such patients are at risk of neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory complications related to immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapies. Early recognition of infectious and noninfectious complications of immunocompromise is essential to guide appropriate treatment, which can include antimicrobial therapy and, in some cases, withdrawal of the predisposing medication with a transition to an alternative regimen.},

Methods:               Fifty-six infants with MD (mean age = 10 months) and 36 with TD (mean age = 5.7 months) were assessed at baseline and then at 1.5, 3, and 6 months postbaseline. A scale was developed to measure object permanence (Object Permanence Scale [OPS]), and the Gross Motor Function Measure sitting subsection (GMFM-SS), and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition (Bayley-III) were administered.                                         Results:               Interrater reliability of the OPS was excellent and correlation between the OPS and Bayley-III cognitive scores was moderately positive. Compared with TD, infants with MD were delayed in development of object permanence but demonstrated increased understanding over time and as sitting skills improved.                                         Conclusion:               In children with MD, object permanence, as quantified by the OPS, emerges in conjunction with sitting skill.},

The thesis is presented that each of these disorders is due to lack of a disorder-specific neurotrophic hormone. The hormone would be elaborated or stored in the target of the affected neurons. It would be released by the postsynaptic cell and then exert its effects in a retrograde fashion after being taken up by the presynaptic terminal. In the lower motor neuron syndromes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, failure of muscle cells to release the appropriate motor neurotrophic hormone would result in impaired function of anterior horn cells. In Parkinson disease, the neurotrophic failure would be characterized by inability of striatal cells to provide the required dopamine neurotrophic hormone with resulting impairment of substantia nigra cells. In Alzheimer disease, the abnormalities would lie in failure of the hippocampus and cortical cells to supply the relevant cholinergic neurotrophic hormone with resulting impairment of medial septal and nucleus basalis neurons. Central nervous system tissue culture provides a convenient system in which to assay these neurotrophic hormones and should permit a test of the hypothesis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Clinical diagnostic criteria for both Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been recently updated. These criteria result in overlap between individuals diagnosed with Parkinson disease and those with dementia with Lewy bodies. Although clinical features and symptomatic treatment overlap, differences remain in epidemiology and expected progression. The high prevalence of cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease supports regular screening for cognitive changes and counseling patients and families regarding what to expect. Treatment for Lewy body dementia involves avoiding medications that may cause or exacerbate symptoms; prescribing pharmacologic agents to address bothersome cognitive, behavioral, movement, and other nonmotor symptoms; recommending physical exercise and therapy; and providing education, counseling, caregiver support, and palliative care.                                         SUMMARY               Lewy body dementia includes both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia, overlapping clinicopathologic entities with differences relating to diagnosis and expected progression. Treatment is symptomatic and thus largely overlapping for the two conditions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and summarise the evidence for the effects of neuromuscular training compared with any other therapy (conventional training/sham) on knee proprioception following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. DESIGN: Systematic Review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, AMED, Scopus and Physical Education Index were searched from inception to February 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of neuromuscular training on knee-specific proprioception tests following a unilateral ACL injury were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the eligible studies using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. Overall certainty in evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. RESULTS: Of 2706 articles retrieved, only 9 RCTs, comprising 327 individuals with an ACL reconstruction (ACLR), met the inclusion criteria. Neuromuscular training interventions varied across studies: whole body vibration therapy, Nintendo-Wii-Fit training, balance training, sport-specific exercises, backward walking, etc. Outcome measures included joint position sense (JPS; n=7), thresholds to detect passive motion (TTDPM; n=3) or quadriceps force control (QFC; n=1). Overall, between-group mean differences indicated inconsistent findings with an increase or decrease of errors associated with JPS by {$\leq$}2{$^\circ$}, TTDPM by {$\leq$}1.5{$^\circ$} and QFC by {$\leq$}6\,Nm in the ACLR knee following neuromuscular training. Owing to serious concerns with three or more GRADE domains (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness or imprecision associated with the findings) for each outcome of interest across studies, the certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity of interventions, methodological limitations, inconsistency of effects (on JPS/TTDPM/QFC) preclude recommendation of one optimal neuromuscular training intervention for improving proprioception following ACL injury in clinical practice. There is a need for methodologically robust RCTs with homogenous populations with ACL injury (managed conservatively or with reconstruction), novel/well-designed neuromuscular training and valid proprioception assessments, which also seem to be lacking.

  abstract = {The dominant characteristics of the human foot are its shock-absorbing capability during walking or gait cycle and its adaptation to uneven surfaces. On the stance phase of the gait, the foot has to be flexible at first for shock absorption and adapt to the terrain; whereas, during the propulsive phase, it has to be dynamically rigid to function as a lever. Foot flexibility and rigidity are mainly controlled at the subtalar and midtarsal joints by tendons and ligaments. The subtalar joint is part of the longitudinal arch, but the midtarsal joint along with the tarsometatarsal joint are components of the transverse arch. However, the existence and functional role of transverse arch in human was challenged by some authors. But recent studies have revealed that the transverse arch has a predominant role in midfoot stiffness (Venkadeshan et al., 2020, \& Holowoka et al., 2017). This midfoot stiffness allows the human foot to store elastic energy at the time of heel strike, which is utilized during the push-off mechanism for propulsion, thus making bipedalism more energy-efficient. Moreover, the transverse arch allows the longitudinal arch to be flexible like a lever and, at the same time, makes the arch of the foot rigid to behave like a stiff spring lever. Understanding the role of the transverse arch is obligatory to study the biomechanics of foot injuries and Charcot or diabetic foot. Studies on diabetic foot have shown that the modulation of transverse arch biomechanics and off-loading modalities would improve outcomes in the form of wound-healing and prevention of re-ulceration.},

Although much is known about the tissue, research has had little success in elucidating the pathogenesis of generalised osteoarthritis. A new hypothesis is required. Substantial changes in many tissues, including bone, muscle, ligaments, and joint capsule, as well as cartilage, are increasingly recognised in this disease, and not all these changes are localised to the affected joints. There is also a well established link with obesity. These observations, the common origins of the mesenchymal cells that maintain these tissues, and the possible role of neuroendocrine factors that can regulate bone mass, result in the hypothesis that systemic factors that include altered lipid metabolism could explain the diversity of physiological changes in generalised osteoarthritis. If proven, this hypothesis could have important implications for a new approach to pharmacological intervention in the early stages of the disease.},

Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL particles, which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD. The totality of available evidence does~not support further limiting the intake of such foods.},

One of the main consequences of this controversy is that the position defended in the classical ANOVA texts on the hypothesis of the significance of the random effect is not the same as that defended in almost all of the professional statistical software programs. METHOD: In this paper, we deal with a detailed analysis about the controversy of mixed model and the decision about one of two basic options, the non restrictive and the restrictive model. RESULTS: Three key questions we consider to go beyond the controversy are: (1) the two classical models are equivalent, (2) the marginality principle do not allow to test main effects in presence of interactive significant effects and (3) the relevance of linear mixed approach to analyze models with fixed and random effects. CONCLUSIONS: We propose the simple solution of using the mixed linear approach with REML estimation instead of the classical linear approach, which is really unapplicable in this context.},

The phosphocreatine created from this reaction is used to supply tissues and cells that require substantial amounts of ATP, like the brain, skeletal muscles, and the heart, with their required ATP.~Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is a central controller of cellular energy homeostasis. Many conditions can cause derangement in CPK levels, including rhabdomyolysis, heart disease, kidney disease, or even certain medications.},

  abstract = {The manner of innervation of the obturator internus, superior and inferior gemelli, and the quadratus femoris in humans (101 pelvic halves) and in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta: 8 pelvic halves) were investigated. In most specimens, the inferior gemellus originated from the lateral surface of the ischial tuberosity and also from the medial surface (intrapelvic origin) just beneath the obturator internus and was covered by the falciform process of the sacrotuberous ligament. The superior gemellus was frequently innervated by the nerve to the obturator internus and the nerve to the quadratus femoris (60.4\%), and the inferior gemellus was innervated by the obturator internus nerve in two specimens. The quadratus femoris nerve originated from more cranial segments than the obturator internus nerve, however these nerves had various communication patterns inside and outside the muscles. According to the intramuscular nerve distribution, in some specimens the branches to the superior gemellus from the quadratus femoris nerve extended to the inferior gemellus, and the branches to the inferior gemellus were distributed to the obturator internus. The present findings revealed that the positional relationships among the branches to the obturator internus and gemelli muscles are relatively constant, although the branching patterns and innervation patterns were varied. The various patterns and routes are considered to reflect the variability of the differentiation patterns of the anlage of the muscles. A possible schematic model of the positional relationships between the muscles and the nerves is proposed.},

Presently, the use of unstable surfaces is excessively utilized by surf coaches and trainers and to date, research does not support this as an effective training method for long-term improvements. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an 8-week Core Strength Training Program (CSTP) on a battery of field tests specific to assessing core musculature and lower body strength for junior competitive surf athletes. Nineteen American junior competitive surf athletes (age:15.7{\textpm}1.01yrs, height:1.77{\textpm}0.007m, mass:64.67{\textpm}9.08kg) completed pre- and post-tests with a transitional pre-season to in-season 8-week CSTP intervention. The battery of tests included: rotational power (RP), time to peak acceleration (TP), maximal acceleration (Ma), maximal countermovement jump (CMJ), estimated peak power (PP), core strength (CS), core endurance (CE), and rotational flexibility (RF). Means, standard deviations, RMANOVA with a significance level of p {$<$} 0.05, and effect sizes were computed. Results demonstrated significant improvements in L.RP, TP, CMJ, PP, CS, and RF. Based on the results, the CSTP is an effective training program for surf coaches and strength and conditioning professionals to improve strength in the core musculature and lower body. In addition, we conclude implementation of the CSTP enhances athletic performance measurements which will likely increase competition success.},

  abstract = {Analgesic design and evaluation have been driven by the desire to create high-affinity high-selectivity mu ({$\mu$})-opioid peptide (MOP) receptor agonists. Such ligands are the mainstay of current clinical practice, and include morphine and fentanyl. Advances in this sphere have come from designing pharmacokinetic advantage, as in rapid metabolism for remifentanil. These produce analgesia, but also the adverse-effect profile that currently defines this drug class: ventilatory depression, tolerance, and abuse liability. The MOP receptor is part of a family, and there are significant functional interactions between other members of the family (delta [{$\delta$}]-opioid peptide [DOP], kappa [{$\kappa$}]-opioid peptide [KOP], and nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor [NOP]). Experimentally, MOP agonism and DOP antagonism produce anti-nociception (animals) with no tolerance, and low doses of MOP and NOP ligands synergise to antinociceptive advantage. In this latter context, the lack of effect of NOP agonists on ventilation is an additional advantage. Recent development has been to move towards low-selectivity multifunctional 'mixed ligands', such as cebranopadol, or ligand mixtures, such as Targinact{\textregistered}. Moreover, the observation that {$\beta$}-arrestin coupling underlies the side-effect profile for MOP ligands (from knockout animal studies) led to the discovery of biased (to G-protein and away from {$\beta$}-arrestin intracellular signalling) MOP ligands, such as oliceridine. There is sufficient excitement in the opioid field to suggest that opioid analgesics without significant side-effects may be on the horizon, and the 'opioid Holy Grail' might be in reach.},

  abstract = {Rotator cuff (RC) disease is an extremely common condition associated with shoulder pain, reduced functional capacities, and impaired quality of life. It primarily involves alterations in tendon health and mechanical properties that can ultimately lead to tendon failure. RC tendon tears induce progressive muscle changes that have a negative impact on surgical reparability of the RC tendons and clinical outcomes. At the same time, a significant base of clinical data suggests a relatively weak relationship between RC integrity and clinical presentation, emphasizing the multifactorial aspects of RC disease. This review aims to summarize the potential contribution of peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal neural factors that may (1) exacerbate structural and functional muscle changes induced by tendon tear, (2) compromise the reversal of these changes during surgery and rehabilitation, (3) contribute to pain generation and persistence of pain, (4) impair shoulder function through reduced proprioception, kinematics, and muscle recruitment, and (5) help explain interindividual differences and response to treatment. Given the current clinical and scientific interest in peripheral nerve injury in the context of RC disease and surgery, we carefully reviewed this body of literature with a particular emphasis on suprascapular neuropathy that has generated a large number of studies in the past decade. Within this process, we highlight the gaps in current knowledge and suggest research avenues for scientists and clinicians.},

The aims of this study were first to assess the anatomical cortical regions that induce PS and second to clarify whether tilt of the subjective visual vertical (SVV)--a sign of vestibular otolith dysfunction--is associated with PS. Sixty-six patients with acute unilateral strokes (28 left-sided lesions, 38 right-sided lesions) were tested for PS, for tilts of the SVV, for hemineglect and for the anatomical lesion site by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based voxelwise lesion-behavior mapping analysis. Our data indicated no significant voxels; however, there was a trend towards an association between lesions of the posterior part of the insula, the operculum and the superior temporal gyrus--key areas of the multisensory vestibular cortical network--and the extent of pushing in patients with right-sided lesions, whereas the rather anterior part of the insula, the operculum as well as the internal capsule reaching to the lateral thalamus seemed to be involved in PS in left-sided lesion patients. These data might point toward a link between the systems responsible for postural control and for processing vestibular otolith information. These findings indicate that vestibular information might be fundamental in right-sided lesion patients for maintaining body posture in space.},

RECENT FINDINGS               As more patients are becoming therapeutically immunosuppressed, human herpesvirus infections are increasingly common. Historically, infections with human herpesviruses were described as temporal lobe encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2. More recently, however, additional pathogens, such as varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6 have been identified to cause serious neurologic infections. As literature emerges, clinical presentations of herpesvirus infections have taken on many new forms, becoming heterogeneous and involving nearly every location along the neuraxis. Advanced diagnostic methods are now available for each specific pathogen in the herpesvirus family. As data emerge on viral resistance to conventional therapies, newer antiviral medications must be considered.                                         SUMMARY               Infections from the herpesvirus family can have devastating neurologic outcomes without prompt and appropriate treatment. Clinical recognition of symptoms and appropriate advanced testing are necessary to correctly identify the infectious etiology. Knowledge of secondary neurologic complications of disease is equally important to prevent additional morbidity and mortality. This article discusses infections of the central and peripheral nervous systems caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6. The pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentations of disease, diagnostic investigations, imaging characteristics, and treatment for each infectious etiology are discussed in detail.},

METHODS: Thirty male patients (mean age: 28.1 years) with ACL reconstruction were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) an experimental group to receive a KT treatment through the muscle and lymphatic correction techniques; or (2) a control group for sham KT. Both interventions were applied twice during a 10-day period from the fourth postoperative day. All patients received the same rehabilitation program for three months. The groups were compared according to range of motion (ROM), pain, swelling and muscle strength before treatment and on the fifth and tenth treatment days. Subjective evaluations were made with the Lysholm, modified Cincinnati and Tegner scores on the first and third postoperative months. RESULTS: Intragroup comparisons showed significant improvements in both groups on the fifth and tenth day and first and third month evaluations (p~{$<~$}0.05). In comparison to the control group, the experimental group showed significant improvements in swelling around the patella, all pain measurements and hamstring muscle strength on the fifth KT day and knee flexion range of motion (ROM), night pain, all swelling measurements and hamstring muscle strength on the tenth KT day (p~{$<~$}0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that KT techniques applied in addition to the acute rehabilitation program of ACL reconstruction are beneficial in treatment of pain, swelling, knee flexion ROM, and hamstring muscle strength.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglyceride had an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) events and received the greatest benefit with fibrate therapy in substudy analyses of the Helsinki Heart Study and the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Study. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this post hoc analysis of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, which enrolled patients with elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and CHD, subgroups defined by HDL-C and triglyceride quartiles were compared to examine the influence of HDL-C and triglyceride on CHD events and response to therapy. Patients in the lowest HDL-C ({$<$}1.00 mmol/L [39 mg/dL]) and highest triglyceride ({$>$}1.80 mmol/L [159 mg/dL]) quartiles (lipid triad; n=458) had increased proportions of other features of the metabolic syndrome (increased body mass index, hypertension, diabetes), men, prior myocardial infarction, prior revascularization, and beta-blocker use than patients in the highest HDL-C ({$>$}1.34 mmol/L [52 mg/dL]) and lowest triglyceride ({$<$}1.11 mmol/L [98 mg/dL]) quartiles (isolated LDL-C elevation; n=545). The major coronary event rate was highest in lipid triad patients on placebo (35.9\%), and this subgroup had the greatest event reduction (relative risk 0.48, 95\% CI 0.33 to 0.69); a significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction (P=0.03) indicated a greater treatment effect in the lipid triad subgroup than the isolated LDL-C elevation subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with elevated LDL-C, low HDL-C, and elevated triglycerides were more likely than patients with isolated LDL-C elevation to have other characteristics of the metabolic syndrome, had increased risk for CHD events on placebo, and received greater benefit with simvastatin therapy.},

This article contextualizes health disparities as they relate to the neurodegenerative processes of ADRD.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Older adults' life expectancy has increased such that a 65-year-old is expected to live 19 or more years and an 85-year-old can expect to live, on average, 6 to 7 years longer. Individuals of certain ethnoracial groups (Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) may be at a higher risk of incident ADRD compared to non-Hispanic/Latino White people. These differences in a higher risk of ADRD across ethnoracial groups persist despite no statistically significant differences in the rate of cognitive decline over time. The intersectionality of social determinants of health, experiences with discrimination and oppression, and access to care are related to the issue of justice and the risk for and expression of ADRD. The theoretical frameworks of various health disparities provide organized approaches to tracking the progression of health disparities for diverse patients.                                         SUMMARY               ADRD health disparities are complex. Neurologists and their care teams must consider the main reasons for clinical ADRD evaluations of members of ethnoracial groups and the factors that may impact patient adherence and compliance with diagnostic and management recommendations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper extremity Physical Performance Tests (PPTs) have been used in sports contexts to provide functional status of the athletes. However, whether these tests present appropriate measurement properties to be considered a valuable measurement is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the measurement properties of upper extremity PPTs in athletes. METHODS: Databases (e.g., Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, CENTRAL) were searched in March 2021. Two reviewers independently rated the methodological quality using the 4-point Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Quality of evidence was graded by measurement property for each test, considering the adequacy, the sample size, and the methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included with a pooled sample of 684 athletes. The PPTs analyzed were Arm-Jump Board Test, Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST), Finger Hang Test, Medicine Ball Explosive Power Test, One-Arm Hop Test, Posterior Shoulder Endurance Test, Pull-Up Shoulder Endurance Test, Repetition to Failure Assessment, Seated Medicine Ball Throw Test (SMBT), Seated Single-Arm Shot-Put Test (SSPT), Shoulder Endurance Test, Two-Arm Bent Hang Test, Unilateral Seated Shot-Put Test, and Upper Limb Rotation Test. Evidence synthesis provided moderate and high-quality evidence for sufficient inter-session and intra-session reliability of the CKCUEST, respectively. There was moderate evidence for sufficient inter-session reliability of the SSPT and for insufficient validity of the SMBT. CONCLUSION: The CKCUEST and the SSPT are sufficiently reliable in athletes. More studies are needed to investigate other psychometric properties for these tests and other upper extremity PPTs.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Combat sports are typically divided into weight classes, and body-mass manipulation to reach a weight class is commonplace. Previous research suggests that weight loss practices in mixed martial arts (MMA) may be more extreme than in other combat sports. PURPOSE: To investigate the magnitude of weight loss and the prevalence of weight loss strategies in different combat sports. METHODS: Competitors (N\,=\,637) from Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, judo, MMA, Muay Thai/kickboxing, taekwondo, and wrestling completed an online questionnaire seeking information regarding their weight loss practices. RESULTS: Body-mass manipulation was commonly undertaken by all combat-sport athletes, with a particularly high incidence of gradual dieting, increased exercise, and fluid restriction. Skipping meals was higher in taekwondo and wrestling (84\%) compared with the other combat sports ({$\sim$}58\%), whereas training in heated rooms and forced oral fluid loss (spitting) was higher in wrestling (83\% and 47\%, respectively) compared with other combat sports ({$\sim$}45\% and {$\sim$}19\%, respectively). MMA athletes reported the highest usage of sauna (76\%) and water loading (67\%) while also reporting the second-highest use of training in rubber/plastic suits (63\%). CONCLUSIONS: Body-mass manipulation was present in all combat sports, with the prevalence and magnitude of acute weight loss greater in MMA. The incidence of and practices reported will help support staff be fully aware of the variety of methods these athletes and coaches may use to achieve weight loss. Additionally, the results could aid regulatory bodies in the further development of policies on weight cutting.},

Due to significant phenotypic overlap, differentiating ON and CGH from primary headache disorders such as migraine or tension-type headache, or other secondary headache disorders, can be clinically challenging. This article reviews the anatomy, clinical features, unique diagnostic considerations, and management approaches relating to ON and CGH. RECENT FINDINGS: Conservative therapeutic approaches are considered first-line. Anesthetic nerve blocks may have a dual role in both supporting diagnosis and providing pain relief. Newer minimally invasive procedures, such as pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) and occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), represent an exciting therapeutic avenue for severe/refractory cases. Surgical interventions should be reserved for select patient populations who have failed all other conservative and minimally invasive options, to be weighed against potential risk. ON and CGH represent an ongoing diagnostic challenge. Further studies are required to consolidate efficacy regarding the comprehensive management of ON and CGH.},

Studies indicate that a generic cognitive neurologic evaluation does not reliably detect spatial neglect, nor does it identify unawareness of deficit after right brain stroke; this article reviews the symptoms, clinical presentation, and management of these two cognitive disorders occurring after right brain stroke.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Stroke and occupational therapy practice guidelines stress a quality standard for spatial neglect assessment and treatment to reduce adverse outcomes for patients, their families, and society. Neurologists may attribute poor outcomes associated with spatial neglect to stroke severity. However, people with spatial neglect are half as likely to return to home and community, have one-third the community mobility, and require 3 times as much caregiver supervision compared with similar stroke survivors. Multiple randomized trials support a feasible first-line rehabilitation approach for spatial neglect: prism adaptation therapy; more than 20 studies reported that this treatment improves daily life independence. Evidence-based treatment of anosognosia is not as developed; however, treatment for this problem is also available.                                         SUMMARY               This article guides neurologists' assessment of right brain cognitive disorders and describes how to efficiently assemble and direct a treatment team to address spatial neglect and unawareness of deficit.},

The procedure is based upon the analysis of variance and the estimation of variance components.

Caution, however, is urged in the application of the definition to a two-way model, i.e., one in which between-rater variance is removed. It is maintained that the frequent use of the standard definition of the one-way intraclass correlation coefficient applied to the two-way classification is not a proper procedure if in fact the coefficient is to be interpreted as a correlation coefficient.

The aim of this study was to develop key recommendations for the physiotherapy management of patients with rib fractures. METHODS: A three-round modified e-Delphi survey design, using an international Delphi panel including physiotherapy clinicians, researchers and lecturers, physician associates, trauma surgeons, and intensivists, was used in this study. The draft recommendations were developed by the Steering Group, based on available research. Over three rounds, panelists rated their agreement (using a Likert scale) with regard to recommendation for physiotherapists delivering respiratory physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation to patients following rib fractures. Recommendations were retained if they achieved consensus (defined as {$\geq$}70\% of panelists {$\geq$}5/7) at the end of each round. RESULTS: A total of 121 participants from 18 countries registered to participate in the study, with 87 (72\%), 77 (64\%), and 79 (65\%) registrants completing the three rounds, respectively. The final guidance document included 18 respiratory physiotherapy and rehabilitation recommendations, mapped over seven clinical scenarios for patients (1) not requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) requiring mechanical ventilation, (3) with no concurrent fracture of the shoulder girdle complex, (4) with a concurrent fracture of the shoulder girdle complex, (5) with/without concurrent upper limb orthopedic injuries, (6) undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures, and (7) at hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: This guidance provides key recommendations for respiratory physiotherapy and physical rehabilitation of patients with rib fractures. It could also be used to inform future research priorities in the field. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV.},

Key aspects of the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms, treatment and rehabilitation, and recovery from concussion/mild TBI are reviewed with an emphasis on the variety of factors that may contribute to cognitive concerns following injury.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms that occur in the immediate aftermath of an applied force and in the hours, days, and weeks thereafter. Although advances have been made in advanced diagnostics, including neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers in hopes of developing objective indicators of injury, such markers currently lack sufficient specificity to be used in clinical diagnostics. The symptoms of concussion are heterogeneous and may be seen to form subtypes, each of which suggests a targeted rehabilitation by the interdisciplinary team. Although the majority of patients with concussion recover within the first 30 to 90 days after injury, some have persistent disabling symptoms. The concept of                 postconcussion syndrome                 , implying a chronic syndrome of injury-specific symptoms, is replaced by a broader concept of                 persistent symptoms after concussion                 . This concept emphasizes the fact that most persistent symptoms have their basis in complex somatic, cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial factors related to risk and resilience. This framework leads to the important conclusion that concussion is a treatable injury from which nearly all patients can be expected to recover.                                                        SUMMARY               Concussion/mild TBI is a significant public health problem in civilian, military, and organized athletic settings. Recent advances have led to a better understanding of underlying pathophysiology and symptom presentation and efficacious treatment and rehabilitation of the resulting symptoms. An interdisciplinary team is well-positioned to provide problem-oriented, integrated care to facilitate recovery and to advance the evidence base supporting effective practice in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.},

  abstract = {PROBLEM: Successful residency placement requires medical students to pursue activities beyond formal education, including showing their commitment to the specialty. Case reports are a common publication pursued by medical students, which provide trainees with opportunities to show commitment to the specialty, broaden their clinical and scholarly knowledge, improve their ability to find and interpret literature, and gain faculty mentorship. However, case reports can be intimidating to trainees with limited exposure to medical writing and publishing. The authors describe a case report elective designed specifically for medical students. APPROACH: Since 2018, Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine has offered a week-long medical student elective designed to teach the process of writing and publishing a case report. Students wrote a first draft of a case report during the elective. Students could pursue publication, including revisions and journal submission, after the elective. An optional, anonymous survey was sent to students who participated in the elective to evaluate their experience with the elective, motivations for taking the elective, and perceived outcomes. OUTCOMES: Between 2018 and 2021, the elective was taken by 41 second-year medical students. Five scholarship outcomes of the elective were measured, including conference presentations (35, 85\% of students) and publications (20, 49\% of students). Students who completed the survey (n = 26) indicated the elective was very valuable with an average score of 85\,{\textpm}\,15.6 (range: minimally valuable [0] to extremely valuable [100]). NEXT STEPS: Next steps for this elective will be to allocate more faculty time to this curriculum promoting both education and scholarship at the institution, and to curate a list of journals to ease the publication process. Overall, student experiences with this case report elective were positive. This report aims to provide a framework for other schools to implement similar courses for their preclinical students.},

This article provides the tools to diagnose and manage patients with autism spectrum disorder.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogeneous condition with varying presentations, multiple etiologies, and a number of comorbidities that impact the course and management of the disorder. This article defines the core features of social communication deficits, including problems with social reciprocity, decreased nonverbal communication, and difficulties in developing and maintaining relationships. The second domain of repetitive behaviors and restricted interests, which includes the presence of stereotyped behaviors or speech, insistence on sameness and behavioral rigidity, intense or out of the ordinary interests, and unusual responses to sensory stimulation, is also delineated. Comorbidities commonly seen with autism spectrum disorder include medical, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions. Despite intense research efforts, the etiology of autism spectrum disorder remains unknown in most cases, but it is clear that a strong genetic component exists that interacts with various environmental risk factors. Current research is identifying overlapping neurobiological pathways that are involved in pathogenesis. Treatment involves intensive behavioral therapy and educational programming along with traditional ancillary services, such as speech/language, occupational, and physical therapies. Psychopharmacologic treatments are also used to target certain symptoms and comorbid conditions.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists can play an important role in diagnosing autism spectrum disorder according to clinical criteria through a comprehensive evaluation that includes a thorough medical and developmental history, behavioral and play observations, and a review of standardized cognitive and language evaluations. Neurologists are also responsible for investigating etiologies, recommending and advocating for appropriate behavioral and educational interventions, and identifying and often managing comorbidities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The attainment of walking is a focus of physical therapy intervention in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and may affect their independence in mobility and participation in daily activities. However, knowledge of determinants of independent walking to guide physical therapists' decision making is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify child factors (postural control, reciprocal lower limb movement, functional strength, and motivation) and family factors (family support to child and support to family) that predict independent walking 1 year later in young children with CP at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels II and III. DESIGN: A secondary data analysis of an observational cohort study was performed. METHODS: Participants were 80 children with CP, 2 through 6 years of age. Child factors were measured 1 year prior to the walking outcome. Parent-reported items representing family factors were collected 7 months after study onset. The predictive model was analyzed using backward stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: A measure of functional strength and dynamic postural control in a sit-to-stand activity was the only significant predictor of taking {$\geq$}3 steps independently. The positive likelihood ratio for predicting a "walker" was 3.26, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.74. The model correctly identified a walker or "nonwalker" 75\% of the time. LIMITATIONS: Prediction of walking ability was limited by the lack of specificity of child and family characteristics not prospectively selected and measurement of postural control, reciprocal lower limb movement, and functional strength 1 year prior to the walking outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to transfer from sitting to standing and from standing to sitting predicted independent walking in young children with CP. Prospective longitudinal studies are recommended to determine indicators of readiness for independent walking.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Rehabilitation is an important aspect of the continuum of care in stroke. With advances in the acute treatment of stroke, more patients will survive stroke with varying degrees of disability. Research in the past decade has expanded our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stroke recovery and has led to the development of new treatment modalities. This article reviews and summarizes the key concepts related to poststroke recovery.                                         Recent Findings:               Good data now exist by which one can predict recovery, especially motor recovery, very soon after stroke onset. Recent trials have not demonstrated a clear benefit associated with very early initiation of rehabilitative therapy after stroke in terms of improvement in poststroke outcomes. However, growing evidence suggests that shorter and more frequent sessions of therapy can be safely started in the first 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. The optimal amount or dose of therapy for stroke remains undetermined, as more intensive treatments have not been associated with better outcomes compared to standard intensities of therapy. Poststroke depression adversely affects recovery across a variety of measures and is an important target for therapy. Additionally, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appears to benefit motor recovery through pleiotropic mechanisms beyond their antidepressant effect. Other pharmacologic approaches also appear to have a benefit in stroke rehabilitation.                                         Summary:               A comprehensive rehabilitation program is essential to optimize poststroke outcomes. Rehabilitation is a process that uses three major principles of recovery: adaptation, restitution, and neuroplasticity. Based on these principles, multiple different approaches, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, exist to enhance rehabilitation. In addition to neurologists, a variety of health care professionals are involved in stroke rehabilitation. Successful rehabilitation involves understanding the natural history of stroke recovery and a multidisciplinary approach with judicious use of resources to identify and treat common poststroke sequelae.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcaneal apophysitis, or Sever's disease, is the most common cause of heel pain in childhood and adolescence. It is regarded as an overuse syndrome. Studies on the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in young athletes and their associated return-to-play time are lacking in the current literature. The aim of our current study was to identify the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in professional youth soccer, the associated time to return-to-play, predisposing factors and their impact on time to return-to-play. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of injury data gathered from a German youth soccer academy in the years 2009-2018. In total, 4326 injury cases in 612 players were included in the study. The diagnosis and the follow-up visits were carried out in a weekly consultation hour at the youth academy. RESULTS: During the observation period of 10~years, 22 cases of calcaneal apophysitis were detected. The incidence of calcaneal apophysitis per 100 athletes per year was found to be 0.36. The mean age of the affected athletes at the time of diagnosis was 11.8\,{\textpm}\,2.1~years (MW\,{\textpm}\,SD). The complaints were unilateral in 20 and bilateral in two cases. Three of the 22 detected cases of calcaneal apophysitis (13.6\%) were recurrent injuries. The mean time to return-to-play of the affected athletes was 60.7\,{\textpm}\,64.9~days (MW\,{\textpm}\,SD). Athletes with recurrent complaints showed longer recovery time and time to return-to-play when compared to players with primary diagnosed disease. Our results could show that neither age nor body mass index at the time of diagnosis had an impact on time to return-to-play. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study investigating the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis and the associated time to return-to-play in youth elite soccer. Calcaneal apophysitis results in substantial time loss for the athletes. Further prospective clinical studies are required to fully understand the etiology and risk factors for calcaneal apophysitis and therefore develop preventive strategies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Functional neuroimaging studies have elucidated the areas involved in central control of autonomic function in humans. Optogenetic and other novel approaches in animal experiments have provided new insights into the role of these areas in autonomic control across behavioral states, including stress and the sleep-wake cycle.                                         SUMMARY               Control of the function of the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system functions depends on complex interactions at all levels of the neuraxis. Peripheral sympathetic outputs are critical for maintenance of blood pressure, thermoregulation, and response to stress. Parasympathetic reflexes control lacrimation, salivation, pupil response to light, beat-to-beat control of the heart rate, gastrointestinal motility, micturition, and erectile function. The insular cortex, anterior and midcingulate cortex, and amygdala generate autonomic responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. Several nuclei of the hypothalamus generate coordinated patterns of autonomic responses to internal or social stressors. Several brainstem nuclei participate in integrated control of autonomic function in relationship to respiration and the sleep-wake cycle. Disorders affecting the central or peripheral autonomic pathways, or both, manifest with autonomic failure (including orthostatic hypotension, anhidrosis, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and neurogenic bladder or erectile dysfunction) or autonomic hyperactivity, primary hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperhidrosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maintaining neutral spinal alignment is considered important when performing the barbell back squat exercise. Since male and female lifters may differ in injury location it is important to examine whether they differ in spinal alignment during the back squat. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to quantify the spinal alignment in the upper and lower lumbar spine during the barbell back squat exercise in male and female lifters. Secondary aims were to compare alignment during the back squat to standing habitual lumbar spine alignment and determine whether male and female lifters differ in these aspects. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, Cross-sectional. METHODS: Competitive power- and weightlifters were recruited and performed three repetitions of the barbell back squat exercise using a load equivalent to 70\% of their one-repetition maximum. Spinal alignment and range of motion were measured using inertial measurement units placed on the thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine. Data was presented descriptively and comparisons between men and women as well as spinal alignment in four different positions were done with a factorial repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Twenty-three (14 males, 9 females) were included. During execution of the squat, spinal alignment adjustments in the lumbar spine were made in all three planes of movement, compared to the start position, in both male and female lifters. Compared to their standing habitual posture, all lifters adjusted their upper lumbar spine to a less lordotic position when in the start position of the back squat (standing upright with the barbell on their back). Only male lifters assumed a less lordotic alignment in their lower lumbar spine in the start position compared their habitual posture. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustments of spinal alignment, predominantly in the sagittal plane, are made during execution of the back squat in both male and female lifters. Further, lifters adopt a less lordotic alignment with a heavy barbell on their upper back, more so in male than female lifters. In conclusion, it seems that spinal alignment changes noticeably during the barbell back squat. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3{\copyright}The Author(s).},

Initial emphasis is placed on clinical history, examination, diagnostic testing, and medical decision making, while subsequent focus is placed on examining specific inflammatory optic neuropathies. Clinical clues, examination findings, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing that differentiate autoimmune, granulomatous, demyelinating, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes of optic neuritis are assessed, and current treatments are evaluated.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in technology and immunology have enhanced our understanding of the pathologies driving inflammatory optic nerve injury. Clinicians are now able to interrogate optic nerve structure and function during inflammatory injury, rapidly identify disease-relevant autoimmune targets, and deliver timely therapeutics to improve visual outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Optic neuritis is a common clinical manifestation of central nervous system inflammation. Depending on the etiology, visual prognosis and the risk for recurrent injury may vary. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of optic neuritis may be critical for limiting vision loss, future neurologic disability, and organ damage.

RECENT FINDINGS               The increased use of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy to treat autoimmune diseases has led to an increase in opportunistic neurologic infections. The description of numerous causes of autoimmune antibody--mediated encephalitis over the past decade has expanded the differential diagnosis of encephalitis beyond infection. The emergence of metagenomic next-generation sequencing has led to diagnoses of rare or unexpected causes of neurologic infections and has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision in neuroinfectious diseases.                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the nervous system can affect any level of the neuraxis and present over any time course. Neurologic infections may present atypically with respect to clinical, radiologic, and CSF analysis features in immunocompromised patients or older adults. A thorough evaluation including systemic features, past medical history, travel, exposures, detailed examination, neuroimaging, and CSF analysis is often necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.

RECENT FINDINGS               Tetanus is most common in lower-income settings, but rare cases are seen in higher-income settings because of the inadequate maintenance of vaccination status. Foodborne botulism remains rare, but botulism can also be caused by IV drug use (wound botulism) and medical use of botulinum toxin (iatrogenic botulism); botulinum toxin has also been considered a potential agent of bioterrorism. Diphtheric neuropathy is rare but has been seen in recent epidemics in the former Soviet Union, and vaccination status is inadequate in a significant proportion of older individuals, creating the potential for subsequent epidemics.                                         SUMMARY               Tetanus, botulism, and diphtheric neuropathy are rare in higher-resource settings where most neurologists practice; however, familiarity with the unique clinical manifestations of and laboratory evaluation for these disorders is essential for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of patients with these conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the tensor fascia latae (TFL) muscle is often clinically implicated in many musculoskeletal disorders. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature of the TFL muscle to determine whether there are differences in its structure and activation between individuals with and without lower limb musculoskeletal conditions. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, and LILACS was undertaken from year of inception to 9 July 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies that directly investigated the structure or activity of the TFL muscle between individuals with a lower limb musculoskeletal condition and a pain-free control group. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included (n\,=\,556 participants), eight reporting structure and ten activation of the TFL muscle. Conditions included lateral hip pain, hip joint pathology, ACL injury, iliotibial band syndrome, and patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis. Meta-analysis identified with low confidence (p value\,=\,0.07) a small tendency towards hypertrophy in the affected side of participants with hip joint diseases (SMD 0.37, 95\% CI [- 0.02, 0.77]). Moderate effect sizes were found for a higher cross-sectional area of the TFL/sartorius ratio in abductor tendon tear (SMD 0.74; 95\% CI [0.05, 1.43, p value\,=\,0.04), and for a smaller body mass normalized TFL volume in patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (SMD - 0.61; 95\% CI [- 1.23, 0.00], p value\,=\,0.05). Normalised electromyography~(EMG) amplitude did not differ between groups for any condition, but when EMG was analysed as linear envelopes or synergies, some differences in pattern of TFL activation were observed between individuals with lateral hip pain and controls. Timing of TFL activation did not differ between individuals with knee conditions and controls. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Common clinical assumptions of the role of TFL muscle in lower limb musculoskeletal conditions are not well investigated and poorly supported by current research. There are contradictory findings on the muscle size of TFL. Differing methodology in muscle activation studies precludes a clear interpretation for comparison between groups.

  abstract = {Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged {$\geq$}18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45{$^\circ$} to one side and neck extended 20{$^\circ$} with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.},

This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of infections of the spine and spinal cord to help practicing clinicians recognize, evaluate, and manage patients with such infections.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Aging of the population, increasing use of immunosuppressive medications, and other factors have contributed to increasing rates of spinal infections. Although the most common agents responsible for spinal infections remain bacteria and viruses, fungal infections occur in individuals who are immunocompromised, and parasitic infections are common in endemic regions, but patterns are in evolution with migration and climate change. Recent outbreaks of acute flaccid myelitis in children have been associated with enteroviruses A71 and D68.                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the spine and spinal cord can be challenging to diagnose, requiring a thorough history and neurologic examination, laboratory studies of serum and CSF, neuroimaging (particularly MRI), and, in some instances, biopsy, to establish a diagnosis and treatment regimen. Interdisciplinary management including collaboration with experts in internal medicine, infectious disease, and neurosurgery is important to improve clinical outcomes.},

Recent articles disagree on whether to continue using these percentage agreement measures, and on which ones to use, and what to do about chance agreements if their use is continued. Much of the disagreement derives from the need to be reasonably certain we do not accept as evidence of true interobserver agreement those agreement levels which are substantially probable as a result of chance observer agreement. The various percentage agreement measures are shown to be adequate to this task, but easier ways are discussed. Tables are given to permit checking to see if obtained disagreements are unlikely due to chance. Particularly important is the discovery of a simple rule that, when met, makes the tables unnecessary. If reliability checks using 50 or more observation occasions produce 10\% or fewer disagreements, for behavior rates from 10\% through 90\%, the agreement achieved is quite improbably the result of chance agreement.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Falls among elderly individuals occur frequently, increase with age, and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. The role of vitamin D in preventing falls among elderly people has not been well established. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of vitamin D in preventing an older person from falling. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from January 1960 to February 2004, EMBASE from January 1991 to February 2004, clinical experts, bibliographies, and abstracts. Search terms included trial terms: randomized-controlled trial or controlled-clinical trial or random-allocation or double-blind method, or single-blind method or uncontrolled-trials with vitamin D terms: cholecalciferol or hydroxycholecalciferols or calcifediol or dihydroxycholecalciferols or calcitriol or vitamin D/aa[analogs \& derivates] or ergocalciferol or vitamin D/bl[blood]; and with accidental falls or falls, and humans. STUDY SELECTION: We included only double-blind randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D in elderly populations (mean age, 60 years) that examined falls resulting from low trauma for which the method of fall ascertainment and definition of falls were defined explicitly. Studies including patients in unstable health states were excluded. Five of 38 identified studies were included in the primary analysis and 5 other studies were included in a sensitivity analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent extraction by 3 authors using predefined data fields including study quality indicators. DATA SYNTHESIS: Based on 5 RCTs involving 1237 participants, vitamin D reduced the corrected odds ratio (OR) of falling by 22\% (corrected OR, 0.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.92) compared with patients receiving calcium or placebo. From the pooled risk difference, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 15 (95\% CI, 8-53), or equivalently 15 patients would need to be treated with vitamin D to prevent 1 person from falling. The inclusion of 5 additional studies, involving 10 001 participants, in a sensitivity analysis resulted in a smaller but still significant effect size (corrected RR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.96). Subgroup analyses suggested that the effect size was independent of calcium supplementation, type of vitamin D, duration of therapy, and sex, but reduced sample sizes made the results statistically nonsignificant for calcium supplementation, cholecalciferol, and among men. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation appears to reduce the risk of falls among ambulatory or institutionalized older individuals with stable health by more than 20\%. Further studies examining the effect of alternative types of vitamin D and their doses, the role of calcium supplementation, and effects in men should be considered.},

Several methods have been developed, including clinical indicators and psychophysical measures. However, whether clinical indicators coincide with the psychophysical test of CS-related sign and symptoms is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical indicators in identifying CS-related sign and symptoms in patients with musculoskeletal pain.                                         Methods               One-hundred consecutive patients with musculoskeletal pain were included. Clinical indicators (index method) based on a combination of patient self-report pain characteristics and physical examination were used to identify the phenotype of patients with musculoskeletal pain and the predominance of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was assessed by the Cold Pressor Test (reference standard), which is a psychophysical test used to detect impairment of CPM. Measurements of the diagnostic accuracy were performed.                                         Results               Twenty-seven patients presented predominance of CS-related sign and symptoms in the assessment of the clinical indicators, and 20 had impairment of CPM. Clinical indicators showed high accuracy (75.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,65.3 to 83.1), high specificity (80.0\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,69.6 to 88.1), high negative predictive value (87.7\%; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,81.2 to 92.1), and a relevant positive likelihood ratio (2.8, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.5 to 5.0) when compared to the Cold Pressor Test.                                         Conclusion               Clinical indicators demonstrated a valuable tool for detecting the impaired CPM, which is a remarkable feature of the CS-related sign and symptoms. Clinicians are encouraged to use the clinical indicators in the management of patients with musculoskeletal pain.},

This book brings a pioneering interactive approach to the teaching of neuroanatomy and comprises 19 chapters that explain the major neuroanatomical systems. Each chapter first presents background material-including an overview of relevant neuroanatomical structures and pathways-and a brief discussion of related clinical disorders. The second half of each chapter is devoted to clinical cases. The cases begin with a narrative of how the patient developed symptoms and what deficits were found on neurological examination. A series of questions challenges the reader to deduce the neuroanatomical location of the patient's lesion and the diagnosis. Discussion and answers follow, revealing the actual outcome. This third edition is fully updated with the latest advances in the field and includes several new cases and enhanced online and digital components"},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Return-to-activity (RTA) assessments are commonly administered after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to manage the patient's postoperative progressions back to activity. To date, few data are available on the clinical utility of these assessments to predict patient outcomes such as secondary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury once the athlete has returned to activity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the measures of patient function at 6 months post-ACLR that best predict RTA and second ACL injury at a minimum of 2 years after ACLR. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 patients with primary, unilateral ACLR completed functional assessments at approximately 6 months post-ACLR. Of these, 192 (82.1\%) completed follow-up at {$\geq$}2 years post-ACLR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The 6-month functional assessments consisted of patient-reported outcomes, isokinetic knee-flexor and -extensor strength, and single-legged hopping. We collected RTA and secondary ACL injury data at {$\geq$}2 years after ACLR. RESULTS: Of the patients who were able to RTA (n = 155), 44 (28.4\%) had a subsequent ACL injury, 24 (15.5\%) to the ipsilateral graft ACL and 20 (12.9\%) to the contralateral ACL. A greater proportion of females had a secondary injury to the contralateral ACL (15/24, 62.5\%), whereas a greater proportion of males reinjured the ipsilateral ACL graft (15/20, 75.0\%; P = .017). Greater knee-extension symmetry at 6 months increased the probability of reinjury (B = 0.016, P = .048). Among patients with RTA at {$<$}8 months, every 1\% increase in quadriceps strength symmetry at 6 months increased the risk of reinjury by 2.1\% (B = 0.021, P = .05). Among patients with RTA at {$>$}8 months, every month that RTA was delayed reduced the risk of reinjury by 28.4\% (B = -0.284, P = .042). Descriptive statistics of patient function stratified between the early and delayed RTA groups can be found in the Supplemental Table (available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0407.20.S1). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with more symmetric quadriceps strength at 6 months post-ACLR were more likely to experience another ACL rupture, especially those who returned to sport at {$<$}8 months after the index surgery. Clinicians should be cognizant that returning high-functioning patients to activity at {$<$}8 months post-ACLR may place them at an increased risk for reinjury.},

A particular focus is on improving diagnostic accuracy to reduce the arduous diagnostic odyssey that so many patients and families endure. Strategies to promote diagnostic accuracy and approach the management of problematic symptoms are also discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although the International Consensus Criteria for bvFTD were published more than a decade ago and clinicopathologic studies have confirmed their utility, diagnostic confusion continues. This article presents updated data along with illustrative cases to emphasize the clinical pearls that are most useful for clinicians. Although accurate prediction of the underlying proteinopathy remains a challenge, the ability to differentiate bvFTD from atypical Alzheimer disease, psychiatric disorders, and other mimickers has improved. Knowledge about the genetic underpinnings in a significant minority of individuals with familial FTLD is enabling early and accurate diagnosis. Therapeutic optimism has also increased, particularly in familial FTLD, with a few clinical trials in progress and several more planned, some of which are designed to slow progression or delay the onset of symptoms, or both.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis and management of bvFTD is challenging for clinicians and particularly for patients and their families. Although much progress has been gained over recent years, several key research questions persist. Treatments that significantly improve symptoms or alter the course of FTLD remain elusive, but optimism is increasing as pathobiology is better understood and novel therapies are being developed.},

Targeted therapies, once few in number with limited penetration into the CNS, have multiplied in number and increased in CNS coverage. This article addresses recent advances in the evaluation and clinical management of patients with CNS metastasis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Metastasis of cancer to the CNS can be diagnosed and characterized with novel techniques, including molecular analyses of the spinal fluid, so-called                 liquid biopsies                 . Resected parenchymal CNS metastases are now routinely subjected to genomic sequencing. For patients with CNS metastases displaying targetable mutations, a wide variety of treatment options are available, including deferral of radiation therapy in favor of a trial of an orally bioavailable targeted therapy or immunotherapy. For patients without a molecularly targetable lesion, local treatment in the form of radiation therapy, now most often stereotactic radiosurgery, is supplanting untargeted whole-brain radiation therapy.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Clinical measurement validity study. OBJECTIVES: To validate the measurement of the pectoralis minor muscle length using palpable landmarks and to explore the accuracy of the measurement using a clinical instrument. BACKGROUND: The pectoralis minor is believed to adaptively shorten. Individuals with a relatively short pectoralis minor demonstrate scapular kinematic alterations that have been associated with shoulder impingement. METHODS AND MEASURES: A 3-dimensional electromagnetic motion capture system was used to calculate the length of the pectoralis minor in 11 cadavers, using 2 measurement techniques. In addition, a measurement with the electromagnetic system using palpable landmarks was compared to a measurement with both a caliper and tape measure in vivo. RESULTS: In cadavers, a measurement using palpable landmarks was determined to be a valid measure of the actual muscle length visualized and measured following dissection. There was a high intraclass correlation coefficient and a small root-mean-square error between these 2 measures. High intraclass correlation coefficients were also calculated in vivo when measurements with the clinical instruments were compared with the electromagnetic device measures. CONCLUSION: A measurement using palpable landmarks for pectoralis minor length validly represents the muscle length in cadavers. A caliper or tape measure may be used clinically with high accuracy and may help clinicians determine the need for and the effectiveness of interventions for lengthening this muscle.},

This article covers the salient features of the migraine postdrome and provides insight into the history, clinical symptoms, and future implications of this phase of migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective electronic diary studies have shown that patients are left disabled with various nonheadache symptoms in the migraine postdrome, and 81\% of patients report at least one nonheadache symptom in the postdrome. Hence, it is important to understand this phase better and ensure that more effective treatments become available in the future to lessen the morbidity associated with this phase. Functional imaging shows widespread reduction in brain-blood flow in the postdrome, which explains the multitudes of symptoms experienced by patients.                                         SUMMARY               The disability related to migraine is not exclusive to the headache phase but extends into the postdrome phase and is associated with several nonheadache symptoms that prolong the symptoms experienced by patients with migraine. Further research into the postdrome is crucial to improve our overall understanding of migraine mechanisms. This knowledge may also help to treat the concurrent nonheadache symptoms better in the future. Novel neuroimaging techniques provide a valuable noninvasive tool to push the frontiers in the understanding of migraine pathophysiology. These methods may help shed further light onto the possible links between key brain structures and networks that could be implicated in the pathophysiology of the various migraine phases.},

An outline of the history and controversy surrounding how these disorders are classified is provided before the article focuses on each disorder's clinical and imaging features.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Over the past decade, the classification of degenerative speech and language disorders has been refined. Clinical, imaging, and pathologic evidence suggests that primary progressive apraxia of speech is a distinct degenerative disorder. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence have highlighted issues with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, which complicates the diagnosis, prognosis, and study of this disorder. Semantic variant PPA, while not without controversy, remains one of the most well-defined disorders, with good clinicopathologic correlation.                                         SUMMARY               Accurate classification and diagnosis of these degenerative speech and language disorders is crucial in clinical practice and ongoing research efforts. For nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA, the authors suggest emphasizing agrammatism as the core inclusion criterion and taking care not to include patients with isolated or predominant apraxia of speech. Isolated apraxia of speech can be the manifestation of a degenerative disease and, based on the different prognosis, should be recognized as distinct from PPA. Finally, it is important to recognize that some patients with semantic dementia, despite sharing the same pathologic associations, may not meet criteria for PPA.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The contribution of rods and cones to the pupillary light reflex has long been known. A third photosensitive cell type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell, has recently been discovered. This cell type employs melanopsin to mediate a portion of the pupillary light reflex independent of rods and cones (the postillumination pupillary response) and photic regulation of circadian rhythm.                                         SUMMARY               The autonomic nervous system regulates pupil size in response to stimuli. The parasympathetic nervous system causes miosis in response to light and near visual stimuli. These stimuli activate supranuclear pathways that project to the Edinger-Westphal nuclei. The sympathetic nervous system causes mydriasis in response to a variety of arousing factors, both physiologic (wakefulness) and pathologic (pain). Abnormalities of physiologic function cause disturbances of pupil size, shape, and response to stimuli. The clinical approach to pupillary abnormalities should focus on the clinical and pharmacologic assessment of the pupil's expected response to diverse stimuli.},

The main subjects of focus were male golfers. Performance parameters were searched for, but the lack of methodological consensus prevented generalization of the results and led to contradictory results. Currently, three-dimensional approaches are commonly used for joint angular kinematic investigations. However, recommendations by the International Society of Biomechanics are rarely considered.},

This clinical suggestion presents a therapeutic exercise called the 90/90 bridge with ball and balloon. This exercise was designed to optimize breathing and enhance both posture and stability in order to improve function and/or decrease pain.

Multiligament injuries are commonly observed with concomitant meniscal, chondral, and neurovascular injuries, requiring a thorough clinical assessment and radiographic evaluation. Due to the higher failure rates associated with knee ligament repair following multiligament knee injury, the current literature favors single-stage anatomic knee reconstructions. Recent studies have also optimized graft sequencing and reconstruction tunnel orientation to prevent graft elongation and reduce the risk of tunnel convergence. In addition, anatomic-based ligament reconstruction techniques and the usage of suture anchors now allow for early postoperative knee motion without the risk of stretching out the graft. Rehabilitation following multiligament knee reconstruction should begin on postoperative day one and typically requires 9-12 months. The purpose of this article is to review the latest principles of the surgically relevant anatomy, biomechanics, evaluation, treatment, rehabilitation, and outcomes of multiligament knee injuries.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, muscle synergies analysis has been commonly used to assess the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying human motor control. Several synergy models and algorithms have been employed for processing the electromyographic (EMG) signal, and it has been shown that the coordination of motor control is characterized by the presence of phasic (movement-related) and tonic (anti-gravity and related to co-contraction) EMG components. Neural substrates indicate that phasic and tonic components have non-homogeneous origin; however, it is still unclear if these components are generated by the same set of synergies or by distinct synergies. This study aims at testing whether phasic and tonic components are generated by distinct phasic and tonic synergies or by the same set of synergies with phasic and tonic activation coefficients. The study also aims at characterizing the differences between the phasic and the tonic synergies. Using a comprehensive mapping of upper-limb point-to-point movements, synergies were extracted from phasic and tonic EMG signal separately, estimating the tonic components with a linear ramp model. The goodness of reconstruction (R2) as a function of the number of synergies was compared, and sets of synergies extracted from each dataset at three R2 threshold levels (0.80, 0.85, 0.90) were retained for further analysis. Then, shared, phasic-specific, and tonic-specific synergies were extracted from the two datasets concatenated. The dimensionality of the synergies shared between the phasic and the tonic datasets was estimated with a bootstrap procedure based on the evaluation of the distribution of principal angles between the subspaces spanned by phasic and tonic synergies due to noise. We found only few shared synergies, indicating that phasic and tonic synergies have in general different structures. To compare consistent differences in synergy composition, shared, phasic-specific, and tonic-specific synergies were clustered separately. Phasic-specific clusters were more numerous than tonic-specific ones, suggesting that they were more differentiated among subjects. The structure of phasic clusters and the higher sparseness indicated that phasic synergies capture specific muscle activation patterns related to the movement while tonic synergies show co-contraction of multiple muscles for joint stabilization and holding postures. These results suggest that in many scenarios phasic and tonic synergies should be extracted separately, especially when performing muscle synergy analysis in patients with abnormal tonic activity and for tuning devices with gravity support.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is one of the most significant healthcare problems nationally and globally. Recently, the first description of the reversal of cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease or its precursors, MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and SCI (subjective cognitive impairment), was published [1]. The therapeutic approach used was programmatic and personalized rather than monotherapeutic and invariant, and was dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND). Patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work, and those struggling at work were able to improve their performance. The patients, their spouses, and their co-workers all reported clear improvements. Here we report the results from quantitative MRI and neuropsychological testing in ten patients with cognitive decline, nine ApoE4+ (five homozygous and four heterozygous) and one ApoE4-, who were treated with the MEND protocol for 5-24 months. The magnitude of the improvement is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective. These results have far-reaching implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, MCI, and SCI; for personalized programs that may enhance pharmaceutical efficacy; and for personal identification of ApoE genotype.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of neuroimmune disorders of the central nervous system is rapidly expanding. Several clinical and paraclinical factors help to inform the diagnosis and ultimately the suspicion for a monophasic versus relapsing course, including the age of the patient (prepubertal versus postpubertal), presence or absence of clinical encephalopathy, identification of serum autoantibodies (eg, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG] and aquaporin-4), presence of intrathecally unique oligoclonal bands, and location/extent of radiologic abnormalities. Collaborative international research efforts have facilitated understanding of the safety and efficacy of currently available immunotherapies in children with acquired demyelinating disorders, particularly multiple sclerosis.                                         SUMMARY               Although many of the demyelinating disorders presented in this article can affect children and adults across the age spectrum, the clinical and radiologic phenotypes, treatment considerations, and long-term prognoses are often distinct in children.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) and postoperative rehabilitation continues to be a multidisciplinary focus in both research and clinical environments. Recent research on ACLR warrants a reexamination of clinicians' current rehabilitation practices to optimize the strikingly variable clinical outcomes after ACLR and return to sport. The purpose of the article and updated guidelines is to use contemporary evidence to systematically revisit our practice guidelines and validate our clinical milestones with data from our university-based practice. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Using the PubMed search engine, articles that reported on ACLR rehabilitation and protocols, guidelines, graft type, healing and strain, return to sport, psychological considerations, and secondary injury prevention published from 1979 to 2020 were identified using the search terms ACLR protocols, guidelines, ACLR rehabilitation, ACL graft, ACL open kinetic chain (OKC) exercise and closed kinetic chain (CKC) exercise, ACLR return to sport, ACLR psychological factors, and ACL injury prevention. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 5. RESULTS: Clinical milestones after ACLR were validated using clinical data collected from 2013 to 2017 at a university-based practice. Variables including knee joint range of motion, effusion, Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale, and quadriceps strength index were tracked throughout rehabilitation and analyzed to help inform an updated ACLR rehabilitation guideline. CONCLUSION: Incorporating the latest research, combined with direct clinical data, provides a current, realistic, and clinically benchmarked strategy for ACLR rehabilitation. Commonly held clinical beliefs regarding rehabilitation after ACL injury must be challenged by the latest research to improve patient outcomes and decrease the risk of reinjury. Key updates to the practice guidelines include the use of frequent and accurate quadriceps strength testing, delayed return-to-sport timeline, immediate use of open kinetic chain exercise, criterion-based progressions for running, sprinting, plyometrics, agility, cutting/pivoting, return to competition, and the inclusion of a secondary prevention program after return to sport.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were investigated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique in 39 patients with lumbar disc herniation and sciatica. Pain duration and pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) were recorded at inclusion, and a clinical examination was performed evaluating neurological findings. The extent of disc herniation (protrusion or extrusion/sequestration) was evaluated perioperatively. Normal concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were present in CSF and serum in almost all patients with lumbar disc herniation. The concentrations of IL-8 in CSF were increased in 12 out of 39 patients, and these increased levels of IL-8 correlated to a short duration of pain and to more pronounced herniation (extrusion or sequestration). No relationship between IL-8 concentrations in CSF and pain intensity, positive neurological findings or a positive straight leg-raising (SLR) test was found. The observation of increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF in patients with a short duration of symptoms supports the concept of the initial involvement of inflammatory mechanisms after a disc herniation. The finding that most of the patients with increased concentrations of IL-8 in CSF had an extrusion or a sequestration may suggest that the increase in IL-8 is related to mechanical nerve root compression, but may also indicate a biochemical effect exerted by the herniated disc on the surrounding tissue. Further studies on the potential role of IL-8 as a biomarker for disc herniation are warranted.},

The scope of this guideline contains nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, including surgical procedures less invasive than knee arthroplasty. It does not provide recommendations for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis of other joints, or other imflammatory athropathies. This guideline contains 29 recommendations to assist all qualified and appropriately trained healthcare professionals involved in the nonarthroplasty management of osteoarthritis of the knee and provide information for patients. In addition, the work group highlighted the need for better research into intra-articular corticosteroid, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma detailing osteoarthritis characterization, including subgroup analyses and osteoarthrosis severity stratification, and clinically relevant outcomes with control subjects for bias and cost-effectiveness analysis. Studies comparing outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis and an MRI confirmed meniscal tear who have undergone partial meniscectomy after failing to improve with a course of conservative treatment (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injection, and physical therapy) versus those who have undergone partial meniscectomy without a dedicated course of conservative treatment. Prospective randomized trials or prospective cohort studies are still needed to establish efficacy of individual oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within specific subgroups and populations to tailor systemic medications to help increase efficacy and decrease the risk of adverse effects.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The clinical diagnosis of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear is based on 3 tests: anterior drawer, pivot shift and Lachman. The latter is the most commonly used test. The "lever sign" is a new clinical test that was first described by Lelli et al. in 2014. The primary objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of the lever sign test for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears, in the primary care setting of patients with acute knee injuries. Primary care being the first point of contact between patients and the healthcare system (general practitioners in this study). The secondary objective was to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the lever sign test, by comparing it to the PPV of the Lachman test and its sensitivity. The working hypothesis was that the sensitivity of the lever sign test was equal to or greater than 80\%. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients with ski-related knee injuries which occurred in French ski resorts between December 1, 2019, and March 15, 2020. The Lachman test and the lever sign test were performed by 36 mountain physicians and were compared to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. The lever sign test involved placing a closed fist under the patient's calf in the supine position and applying downward pressure over the quadriceps. Depending on whether the ACL was intact or not, the patient's heel would either rise off the examination table or remain still. This study included 258 patients: 190 women and 68 men. RESULTS: The MRIs found 219 ACL tears and 36 intact ACLs. Three MRIs were deemed uninterpretable. The sensitivity of the lever sign test was 61.2\% and the PPV was 83.8\%. The sensitivity of the Lachman test was 99.1\% and the PPV was 86.5\%. CONCLUSION: This study determined the sensitivity of the lever sign test for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears during real-life situations encountered by mountain physicians. This sensitivity was lower than expected. The Lachman test, on the other hand, showed a very high sensitivity. It remains the test of choice for the clinical diagnosis of ACL tears in patients with knee injuries. Therefore, the lever sign test can complement the Lachman test but is not a substitute for it.

  abstract = {This paper presents a four-stage plyometric program to be undertaken as part of criterion-based rehabilitation for athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). After ACLR, the patient experiences alterations of joint mobility, gait and movement patterns, neuromuscular function and general physical fitness. Plyometric training is an important component for neuromuscular and movement re-conditioning after ACLR. Effective use of plyometrics can support enhancements in explosive sporting performance, movement quality and lower risk of injury. Plyometric training, as a component of the ACL functional recovery process, can aid in restoring function and supporting timely return to sport. However, few patients undertake or complete a plyometric program prior to return-to-sport. To truly impact individual patients, a stronger focus on research implementation is needed from researchers to translate efficacious interventions into practice. In designing a plyometric program, it is important to match the specific plyometric tasks to the functional recovery status of the ACLR patient. To do this, it is important to understand the relative intensity of plyometrics tasks, align these tasks to the ACL functional recovery process and monitor the athlete as part of criterion based rehabilitation. Plyometric intensity is based on the intensity of efforts, the vertical and/or horizontal momentum prior to ground contact, the ground contact time and the surface or environment on which they are performed on/in. Furthermore, how the person technically performs the task will influence joint loading. There should be a gradual increase in task intensity and specificity throughout the program, with all tasks used for both neuromuscular and motor control re-conditioning. The aim of this paper is to provide recommendations to clinicians on how to design and implement plyometric training programs for the ACLR patient, as part of the functional recovery process.

RECENT FINDINGS               The migraine preventive treatment landscape has been transformed by the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor. These treatments, which are given subcutaneously or intravenously monthly or quarterly, have high efficacy and were well tolerated in clinical trials. Emerging real-world studies have found higher rates of adverse events than were seen in clinical trials. They are currently recommended for use if two traditional preventive therapies have proven inadequate. Since the commonly cited 2012 American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology migraine prevention guidelines were released, clinical trials supporting the preventive use of lisinopril, candesartan, and memantine have been published. Neuromodulation devices, including external trigeminal nerve stimulation and single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation devices, have modest evidence to support preventive use. The American Headache Society/American Academy of Neurology guidelines for the preventive treatment of migraine are currently being updated. A new class of oral CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants) is being tested for migraine prevention.                                         SUMMARY               Successful preventive treatment of migraine reduces disease burden and improves quality of life. Many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options are available for the prevention of migraine, including newer therapies aimed at the CGRP pathway as well as older treatments with good evidence for efficacy. Multiple treatment trials may be required to find the best preventive for an individual patient.},

  abstract = {Progression markers of Parkinson's disease are crucial for successful therapeutic development. Recently, a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging analysis technique using a bitensor model was introduced allowing the estimation of the fractional volume of free water within a voxel, which is expected to increase in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Prior work demonstrated that free water in the posterior substantia nigra was elevated in Parkinson's disease compared to controls across single- and multi-site cohorts, and increased over 1 year in Parkinson's disease but not in controls at a single site. Here, the goal was to validate free water in the posterior substantia nigra as a progression marker in Parkinson's disease, and describe the pattern of progression of free water in patients with a 4-year follow-up tested in a multicentre international longitudinal study of de novo Parkinson's disease (http://www.ppmi-info.org/). The analyses examined: (i) 1-year changes in free water in 103 de novo patients with Parkinson's disease and 49 controls; (ii) 2- and 4-year changes in free water in a subset of 46 patients with Parkinson's disease imaged at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 months; (iii) whether 1- and 2-year changes in free water predict 4-year changes in the Hoehn and Yahr scale; and (iv) the relationship between 4-year changes in free water and striatal binding ratio in a subgroup of Parkinson's disease who had undergone both diffusion and dopamine transporter imaging. Results demonstrated that: (i) free water level in the posterior substantia nigra increased over 1 year in de novo Parkinson's disease but not in controls; (ii) free water kept increasing over 4 years in Parkinson's disease; (iii) sex and baseline free water predicted 4-year changes in free water; (iv) free water increases over 1 and 2 years were related to worsening on the Hoehn and Yahr scale over 4 years; and (v) the 4-year increase in free water was associated with the 4-year decrease in striatal binding ratio in the putamen. Importantly, all longitudinal results were consistent across sites. In summary, this study demonstrates an increase over 1 year in free water in the posterior substantia nigra in a large cohort of de novo patients with Parkinson's disease from a multi-site cohort study and no change in healthy controls, and further demonstrates an increase of free water in Parkinson's disease over the course of 4 years. A key finding was that results are consistent across sites and the 1-year and 2-year increase in free water in the posterior substantia nigra predicts subsequent long-term progression on the Hoehn and Yahr staging system. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that free water in the posterior substantia nigra is a valid, progression imaging marker of Parkinson's disease, which may be used in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.},

The TACs are composed of five diseases: cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA), and hemicrania continua.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New classifications for the TACs have two important updates; chronic cluster headache is now defined as remission periods lasting less than 3 months (formerly less than 1 month), and hemicrania continua is now classified as a TAC (formerly classified as                 other primary headache                 ). The first-line treatments of TACs have not changed in recent years: cluster headache is managed with oxygen, triptans, and verapamil; paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua are managed with indomethacin; and SUNCT and SUNA are managed with lamotrigine. However, advancements in neuromodulation have recently provided additional options for patients with cluster headache, which include noninvasive devices for abortive therapy and invasive devices for refractory cluster headache. Patient selection for these devices is key.

Proper diagnosis is crucial for proper treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiology, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of the TACs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical therapy intervention is often sought to treat cervical spine conditions and a comprehensive physical therapy examination has been associated with more favourable outcomes. The cervical relocation test (CRT) is one method used to assess joint position sense (PS) integrity of the cervical spine. Previous research has found significant differences in the CRT between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Impaired kinaesthetic awareness in the cervical spine may be associated with degenerative joint disease, chronicity of the complaint and increased susceptibility to re-injury. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the intertester and intratester reliability of cervical relocation using the cervical range of motion instrument (CROM) and an affixed laser (AL) device among subjects with and without a history of neck pain. In addition, it was hypothesised that those individuals with a history of neck pain would have greater difficulty on the CRT. METHODS: A total of 50 asymptomatic subjects (n\,=\,50) were assigned to two researchers. The CRT was performed for each tester by the subject rotating the cervical spine for three trials to the right and left for the CROM and AL. RESULTS: The results indicate a significant intertester reliability of the CROM (interclass correlation coefficient (ICC)\,=\,0.717[0.502-0.839]; 0.773[0.595-0.873]) for the subjects in this sample. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the CROM is a reliable device for measuring cervical relocation between different testers. Future research should investigate if the CRT is predictive of prognosis in patients with cervical pathology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical therapy (PT) rehabilitation is critical to successful outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Later-stage rehabilitation, including sport-specific exercises, is increasingly recognized for restoring high-level knee function. However, supervised PT visits have historically been concentrated during the early stages of recovery after ACLR. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the number and temporal utilization of PT visits after ACLR in a national cohort. We hypothesized that PT visits would be concentrated early in the postoperative period. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiological study. METHODS: The Humana PearlDiver database was searched to identify patients who underwent ACLR between 2007 and 2017. Patients with additional structures treated were excluded. The mean {\textpm} SD, median and interquartile range (IQR), and range of number of PT visits for each patient were determined for the 52 weeks after ACLR. PT visits over time were also assessed in relation to patient age and sex. RESULTS: In total, 11,518 patients who underwent ACLR met the inclusion criteria; the mean age was 32.62 {\textpm} 13.70 years, and 42.7\% were female patients. Of this study cohort, 10,381 (90.4\%) had documented PT postoperatively; the range of PT visits was 0 to 121. On average, patients had 16.90 {\textpm} 10.60 PT visits (median [IQR], 16 [9-22]) after ACLR. Patients completed a mean of 52\% of their PT visits in the first 6 weeks, 75\% in the first 10 weeks, and 90\% in the first 16 weeks after surgery. Patients aged 10 to 19 years had the highest number of PT visits (mean {\textpm} SD, 19.67 {\textpm} 12.09; median [IQR], 18 [12-25]), significantly greater than other age groups (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: PT after ACLR is concentrated in the early postoperative period. Physicians, therapists, and patients may consider adjusting the limited access to PT to optimize patient recovery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As supervised PT visits may be limited, the appropriate temporal utilization of supervised PT visits must be maximized. Strategies to ensure sessions for later neuromuscular and activity-specific rehabilitation are needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aphasia is a common consequence of stroke, and people who live with this condition experience poor outcomes. Adherence to clinical practice guidelines can promote high-quality service delivery and optimize patient outcomes. However, there are currently no high-quality guidelines specific to post-stroke aphasia management. AIMS: To identify and evaluate recommendations from high-quality stroke guidelines that can inform aphasia management. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: We conducted an updated systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify high-quality clinical guidelines published between January 2015 and October 2022. Primary searches were performed using electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Gray literature searches were conducted using Google Scholar, guideline databases, and stroke websites. Clinical practice guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) tool. Recommendations were extracted from high-quality guidelines (scored\,{$>$}\,66.7\% on Domain 3: "Rigor of Development"), classified as aphasia-specific or aphasia-related, and categorized into clinical practice areas. Evidence ratings and source citations were assessed, and similar recommendations were grouped. Twenty-three stroke clinical practice guidelines were identified and 9 (39\%) met our criteria for rigor of development. From these guidelines, 82 recommendations for aphasia management were extracted: 31 were aphasia-specific, 51 aphasia-related, 67 evidence-based, and 15 consensus-based. CONCLUSION: More than half of stroke clinical practice guidelines identified did not meet our criteria for rigorous development. We identified 9 high-quality guidelines and 82 recommendations to inform aphasia management. Most recommendations were aphasia-related; aphasia-specific recommendation gaps were identified in three clinical practice areas: "accessing community supports," "return to work, leisure, driving," and "interprofessional practice."},

  abstract = {Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) causing neurogenic claudication (NC) is increasingly common with an aging population and can be associated with significant symptoms and functional limitations. We developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on nonsurgical management of patients with LSS causing NC. Using the GRADE approach, a multidisciplinary guidelines panel based recommendations on evidence from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published through June 2019, or expert consensus. The literature monitored up to October 2020. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, disability, quality of life, and walking capacity. The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with LSS (congenital and/or acquired, lateral recess or central canal, with or without low back pain, with or without spondylolisthesis) causing NC. The guidelines panel developed 6 recommendations based on randomized controlled trials and 5 others based on professional consensus, summarized in 3 overarching recommendations: (Grade: statements are all conditional/weak recommendations)~Recommendation 1.~For patients with LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may initially select multimodal care nonpharmacological therapies with education, advice and lifestyle changes, behavioral change techniques in conjunction with home exercise, manual therapy, and/or rehabilitation (moderate-quality evidence), traditional acupuncture on a trial basis (very low-quality evidence), and postoperative rehabilitation (supervised program of exercises and/or educational materials encouraging activity) with cognitive-behavioral therapy 12 weeks postsurgery (low-quality evidence).~Recommendation 2.~In patients LSS causing NC, clinicians and patients may consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. (very low-quality evidence).~Recommendation 3.~For patients LSS causing NC, we recommend against the use of the following pharmacological therapies: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, methylcobalamin, calcitonin, paracetamol, opioids, muscle relaxants, pregabalin (consensus-based), gabapentin (very low-quality), and epidural steroidal injections (high-quality evidence). PERSPECTIVE: This guideline, on the basis of a systematic review of the evidence on the nonsurgical management of lumbar spine stenosis, provides recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Safe and effective non-surgical management of lumbar spine stenosis should be on the basis of a plan of care tailored to the individual and the type of treatment involved, and multimodal care is recommended in most situations.},

  abstract = {Traditional rehabilitation for shoulder dislocation has a success rate of only 20\%. The body blade has been hypothesized to strengthen the muscles stabilizing the shoulder girdle by training the contractile tissues directly and also indirectly affecting the joint and surrounding noncontractile tissues when responding to rapid positional changes and mechanical energy. Shoulder dislocation negatively affects both the active (musculature) and passive (joint and ligaments) stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint. Therefore, the purpose of this case report was to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic exercise using the body blade in the conservative management of an individual with glenohumeral instability. The patient, an 18-year-old male, dislocated his left shoulder after a wave crashed on top of him. Intervention included therapeutic exercise using the body blade. Measures were taken at examination, re-evaluation (6th visit), and discharge (11th visit). According to the 11-point numeric pain rating scale, worst pain was reduced from 4 to 0. Glenohumeral ROM measures at discharge were all within normal range except external rotation (deficit of 10 degrees), compared to the initial ROM deficits of 10-35\% of noninvolved values. Post intervention strength, as assessed by handheld dynamometry, revealed deficits only in scapular retraction compared to the uninvolved side (21\% compared to an initial deficit of 39\%). Other muscle groups showing deficits from 20\% to 40\% at initial examination exceeded the comparative strength of the other limb at discharge. The SPADI and WOSI scores were reduced from 13 to 0 and 482 to 46, from initial examination to discharge, respectively. Furthermore 6 months post episode of care the patient reported no recurrent dislocation of the involved shoulder. The success rate of an exercise program with individuals who have dislocated their glenohumeral joint is poor. After 11 visits of physical therapy using the body blade the patient improved in ROM, strength, and function.},

It is now known that understanding more about why things hurt can actually help people to overcome their pain. Recent advances in fields such as neurophysiology, brain imaging, immunology, psychology and cellular biology have provided an explanatory platform from which to explore pain. This book discusses how pain responses are produced by the brain; how responses to injury from the autonomic motor and immune systems in your body contribute to pain, and why pain can persist after tissues have had plenty of time to heal. This book, with its easy to follow language, discusses how pain experiences are constructed in response to dangers and threats in our bodies and influenced by our thoughts, beliefs and context.

This article summarizes the clinical and genetic aspects of these disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, diagnoses of congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy have been made by clinical features and histopathology; however, recent advances in genetics have changed diagnostic practice by relying more heavily on genetic findings. This article reviews the clinical and genetic features of the most common congenital muscular dystrophies including laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA2)--related (merosin deficient), collagen VI--related, and {$\alpha$}-dystroglycan--related congenital muscular dystrophies and reviews the most common congenital myopathies including nemaline rod, core, and centronuclear myopathies. With the increasing accessibility of genetic testing, the number of genes found to be associated with these disorders has increased dramatically. A wide spectrum of severity and onset (from birth to adulthood) exist across all subtypes. Progression and other features are variable depending on the subtype and severity of the specific genetic mutation.                                         SUMMARY               Congenital muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy are increasingly recognized disorders. A growing appreciation for the breadth of phenotypic variability and overlap between established subtypes has challenged long-standing phenotypic and histopathologic classifications of these disorders but has driven a greater understanding of pathogenesis and opened the door to the development of novel treatments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe cross-sectional relationships between postconcussion symptom catastrophizing and patient-level factors in a postconcussion cohort. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an outpatient rehabilitation hospital concussion clinic and consisted of adults undergoing a neuropsychological evaluation. Cronbach {$\alpha$} assessed internal consistency for Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores. Pearson r correlation coefficients assessed construct validity among emotional function measures and Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores at initial evaluation. Hierarchical regression models were used to assess criterion validity. RESULTS: Excellent internal consistency was observed for Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores ({$\alpha$} = 0.953). The Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale was significantly correlated with cause of injury ( r = -0.223, P {$<$} 0.01), litigation consideration ( r = 0.309, P {$<$} 0.05), and history of psychiatric illness ( r = 0.198, P {$<$} 0.01). The Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale was significantly correlated with emotional functioning (Patient Health Questionnaire [ r = 0.600, P {$<$} 0.05]; Generalized Anxiety Disorder [ r = 0.602, P {$<$} 0.05]), symptom rating (Sports Concussion Assessment Tool [Fifth Edition, r = 0.477, P {$<$} 0.05]), and cognitive functioning (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status [ r = -0.238, P {$<$} 0.05]) measures. The final regression model explained 64.7\% variance in Post-Concussion Symptom Catastrophizing Scale total scores and included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( b = 1.038, {$\beta$} = 0.466, P = 0.001) as a unique predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate strong, positive relationships between anxiety and catastrophizing at initial neuropsychological evaluation in a postconcussion sample.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an exercise protocol, with and without manual therapy, on scapular kinematics, function, pain, and mechanical sensitivity in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. BACKGROUND: Stretching and strengthening exercises have been shown to effectively decrease pain and disability in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. There is still conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of adding manual therapy to an exercise therapy regimen. METHODS: Forty-six patients were assigned to 1 of 2 groups, one of which received a 4-week intervention of stretching and strengthening exercises (exercise alone) and the other the same intervention, supplemented by manual therapy targeting the shoulder and cervical spine (exercise plus manual therapy). All outcomes were measured preintervention and postintervention at 4 weeks. Outcome measures were scapular kinematics in the scapular and sagittal planes during arm elevation, function as determined through the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, pain as assessed with a visual analog scale, and mechanical sensitivity as assessed with pressure pain threshold. RESULTS: Independent of the intervention group, small, clinically irrelevant changes in scapular kinematics were observed postintervention. A significant group-by-time interaction effect (P = .001) was found for scapular anterior tilt during elevation in the sagittal plane, with a 3.0{$^\circ$} increase (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -1.5{$^\circ$}, 7.5{$^\circ$}) relative to baseline in the exercise-plus-manual therapy group compared to a decrease of 0.3{$^\circ$} (95\% CI: -4.2{$^\circ$}, 4.8{$^\circ$}) in the exercise-alone group. Pain, mechanical sensitivity, and the DASH score improved similarly for both groups by the end of the intervention period. CONCLUSION: Adding manual therapy to an exercise protocol did not enhance improvements in scapular kinematics, function, and pain in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome. The noted improvements in pain and function are not likely explained by changes in scapular kinematics.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Dementia clinical syndromes are frequently caused by mixed pathologies, leading to varied clinical presentations that include memory loss, behavioral changes, communication challenges, safety concerns, and loss of independent function. Medications for treating dementia currently target cognitive and behavioral symptoms, although disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease may be making their way into widespread clinical practice soon. Identification and treatment of co-occurring medical problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea, adverse medication effects, mood disorders, hearing loss, pain, alcohol misuse, and vascular risk factors, may mitigate the impact of these conditions on cognitive decline. Mobilization of clinical and community-based interprofessional teams will ensure that people with dementia and their care partners have the expertise, support, and access to resources they need. Addressing goals of care early in the disease course will allow people with dementia to contribute to their care plan by expressing their wishes.                                         SUMMARY               Developing a structured approach to treating common causes of dementia and related comorbid medical conditions, identifying a local network of interprofessional clinical and community-based referrals, and providing readily available educational resources will help clinicians provide quality dementia care management that extends beyond the clinic visit. Encouraging patients and families to engage in clinical research will advance the identification of effective therapies, preventive strategies, and quality care models for the future.},

Methods               : Methods were consistent with the World Health Organization protocols for developing guidelines. Systematic reviews of the evidence on physical activity for health for people living with disability were appraised, along with a consideration of the evidence used to inform the general 2020 World Health Organization guidelines.               Results               : Evidence supported the development of recommendations for people living with disability, stressing that there are no major risks to engaging in physical activity appropriate to an individual's current activity level, health status, and physical function, and that the health benefits accrued generally outweigh the risks. They also emphasize the benefits of limiting sedentary behavior.               Conclusions               : The guidelines mark a positive step forward for disability inclusion, but considerable effort is needed to advance the agenda.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meniscal injuries are commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. Treatment of meniscal injuries can impart delayed weightbearing and range of motion restrictions, which can affect the rehabilitation protocol. The effect of meniscal treatment and subsequent restrictions on strength recovery after ACL reconstruction is unclear. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to compare strength, jumping performance, and patient-reported outcomes between patients who underwent isolated ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and those who underwent surgical intervention for meniscal pathology at the time of ACLR. Our hypothesis was that patients who underwent concurrent meniscal repair (MR) would have lower strength recovery owing to postoperative restrictions. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Patients with ACLR were stratified into isolated ACLR, ACLR and meniscectomy (ACLR-MS), or ACLR-MR groups and were compared with healthy controls. The ACLR-MR group was restricted to partial weightbearing and to 90{$^\circ$} of knee flexion for the first 6 weeks postoperatively. All participants completed patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]) and underwent bilateral isokinetic and isometric strength tests of the knee extensor and flexor groups as part of a return-to-sports test battery at 5 to 7 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 165 patients with ACLR (50 with isolated ACLR, 44 with ACLR-MS, and 71 with ACLR-MR) and 140 healthy controls were included in the study. Follow-up occurred at a mean of 5.96 {\textpm} 0.47 months postoperatively. The control group demonstrated higher subjective knee function, unilateral peak extensor torque, and limb symmetry than did the ACLR-MS and ACLR-MR groups combined (P {$<$} .001 for all). There were no differences in IKDC, KOOS subscales, or unilateral or limb symmetry measures of peak knee extensor or flexor torque among the isolated ACLR, ACLR-MS, and ACLR-MR groups. CONCLUSION: Persistent weakness, asymmetry, and reduced subjective outcome scores at 6-month follow-up after ACLR were not influenced by meniscal treatment. These findings suggested that the weightbearing and range of motion restrictions associated with meniscal repair recovery do not result in loss of early strength or worse patient-reported outcomes.},

The article presents an evaluation strategy that highly leverages the two major classification schemes of myoclonus. The goal of this article is to link evaluation strategy with diagnosis and treatment of myoclonus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The growth of medical literature has helped better define myoclonus etiologies. Physiologic study of myoclonus types and etiologies with electrophysiologic testing has provided greater clarity to the pathophysiology of the myoclonus in various diseases. Although studies have been limited, the role of newer treatment agents and methods has made progress.                                         SUMMARY               Myoclonus has hundreds of different etiologies. Classification is necessary to evaluate myoclonus efficiently and pragmatically. The classification of myoclonus etiology, which is grouped by different clinical presentations, helps determine the etiology and treatment of the myoclonus. The classification of myoclonus physiology using electrophysiologic test results helps determine the pathophysiology of the myoclonus and can be used to strategize symptomatic treatment approaches. Both basic ancillary testing (including EEG and imaging) and more comprehensive testing may be necessary. Treatment of the underlying etiology is the ideal approach. However, if such treatment is not possible or is delayed, symptomatic treatment guided by the myoclonus physiology should be considered. More controlled study of myoclonus treatment is needed. Further research on myoclonus generation mechanisms should shed light on future treatment possibilities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by an incompletely reversible limitation in airflow. A physiological variable--the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)--is often used to grade the severity of COPD. However, patients with COPD have systemic manifestations that are not reflected by the FEV1. We hypothesized that a multidimensional grading system that assessed the respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD would better categorize and predict outcome in these patients. METHODS: We first evaluated 207 patients and found that four factors predicted the risk of death in this cohort: the body-mass index (B), the degree of airflow obstruction (O) and dyspnea (D), and exercise capacity (E), measured by the six-minute-walk test. We used these variables to construct the BODE index, a multidimensional 10-point scale in which higher scores indicate a higher risk of death. We then prospectively validated the index in a cohort of 625 patients, with death from any cause and from respiratory causes as the outcome variables. RESULTS: There were 25 deaths among the first 207 patients and 162 deaths (26 percent) in the validation cohort. Sixty-one percent of the deaths in the validation cohort were due to respiratory insufficiency, 14 percent to myocardial infarction, 12 percent to lung cancer, and 13 percent to other causes. Patients with higher BODE scores were at higher risk for death; the hazard ratio for death from any cause per one-point increase in the BODE score was 1.34 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.26 to 1.42; P{$<$}0.001), and the hazard ratio for death from respiratory causes was 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.77; P{$<$}0.001). The C statistic for the ability of the BODE index to predict the risk of death was larger than that for the FEV1 (0.74 vs. 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: The BODE index, a simple multidimensional grading system, is better than the FEV1 at predicting the risk of death from any cause and from respiratory causes among patients with COPD.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determining the etiology of disorders that manifest with chronic dizziness can seem a daunting task, but extracting some basic elements of the patient's history can reduce the differential diagnosis significantly. This includes determining initial triggers, timing of symptoms, associated features, and exacerbating factors. This article covers distinct causes of chronic dizziness including persistent postural perceptual dizziness, mal de d{\'e}barquement syndrome, motion sickness and visually induced motion sickness, bilateral vestibulopathy, and persistent dizziness after mild concussion. RECENT FINDINGS: To date, none of the disorders above has a cure but are considered chronic syndromes with fluctuations that are both innate and driven by environmental stressors. As such, the mainstay of therapy for chronic disorders of dizziness involves managing factors that exacerbate symptoms and adding vestibular rehabilitation or cognitive-behavioral therapy alone or in combination, as appropriate. These therapies are supplemented by serotonergic antidepressants that modulate sensory gating and reduce anxiety. Besides expectation management, ruling out concurrent disorders and recognizing behavioral and lifestyle factors that affect symptom severity are critical issues in reducing morbidity for each disorder. SUMMARY: Many syndromes of chronic dizziness can be diagnosed by recognition of key features, although many symptoms overlap between these groups. Symptoms may be manageable and improve with time, but they are often incompletely relieved.},

We present a systematic review of the existing literature describing biomechanical adaptations in the dominant shoulders of volleyball players and factors that may predispose to shoulder pain/injury. A thorough literature search via Medline, EMBASE and SCOPUS was conducted for original studies of volleyball players and 15 eligible articles were identified. Assessment of study quality was performed using the STROBE statement. The reviewed literature supports the existence of a glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) and a possible (and less pronounced) external rotation gain in the dominant vs. the non-dominant shoulder of volleyball athletes. Unlike other overhead sports, the GIRD in volleyball athletes appears to be anatomical as a response to the repetitive overhead movements and not to be associated with shoulder pain/injury. Additionally, the dominant shoulder exhibits muscular imbalance, which appears to be a significant risk factor for shoulder pain. Strengthening of the external rotators should be used alongside shoulder stretching and joint mobilisations, core strengthening and optimisation of spike technique as part of injury management and prevention programmes.},

Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults. Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy. In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.},

Emphasis is placed on understanding the common underlying types of cerebrovascular disease (including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) and awareness of rare inherited cerebrovascular disorders.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The pathophysiology of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia is heterogeneous, and the most recent diagnostic criteria for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia break down the diagnosis of major vascular dementia into four phenotypic categories, including subcortical ischemic vascular dementia, poststroke dementia, multi-infarct dementia, and mixed dementia. Control of cardiovascular risk factors, including management of midlife blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugars, remains the mainstay of prevention for vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy requires special consideration when it comes to risk factor management given the increased risk of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. Recent trials suggest some improvement in global cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment and dementia with targeted cognitive rehabilitation.                                         SUMMARY               Thorough clinical evaluation and neuroimaging form the basis for diagnosis.

Many clinicians may have conducted informal "mini-experiments" on their own to determine which treatment is best suited for the problem. These results are usually not documented or reported in a formal manner because many clinicians feel that they are "statistically challenged." Another reason may be because clinicians do not feel they have controlled enough test conditions to warrant analysis. In this update, a statistic is described that does not involve complicated statistical assumptions, making it a simple and easy-to-use statistical method. This update examines the use of two statistics and does not deal with other issues that could affect clinical research such as issues affecting credibility. For readers who want a more in-depth examination of this topic, references have been provided. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis-of-variance-by-ranks test (or H test) is used to determine whether three or more independent groups are the same or different on some variable of interest when an ordinal level of data or an interval or ratio level of data is available. A hypothetical example will be presented to explain when and how to use this statistic, how to interpret results using the statistic, the advantages and disadvantages of the statistic, and what to look for in a written report. This hypothetical example will involve the use of ratio data to demonstrate how to choose between using the nonparametric H test and the more powerful parametric F test.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Prospective clinical studies have reinforced the understanding that migraine aura is highly variable from one individual to the next as well as from attack to attack in an individual. While migraine with aura clearly has a higher heritability than migraine without aura, population studies have not identified specific genes that underlie this heritability for typical migraine with aura. Imaging studies reveal hypoperfusion associated with migraine aura, although the timing and distribution of this hypoperfusion is not strictly correlated with migraine symptoms. Mapping of migraine visual aura symptoms onto the visual cortex suggests that the mechanisms underlying the aura propagate in a linear fashion along gyri or sulci rather than as a concentric wave and also suggests that aura may propagate in the absence of clinical symptoms. Cortical spreading depression in animal models continues to be a translational model for migraine, and the study of spreading depolarizations in the injured human brain has provided new insight into potential mechanisms of cortical spreading depression in migraine. Migraine with aura has multiple comorbidities including patent foramen ovale, stroke, and psychiatric disorders; the shared mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remains a topic of active investigation.

With the aging population, the number of people with atherosclerotic stroke will increase in the coming decades. This article reviews the recent developments in the assessment and treatment of extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

As statistical and data science engines accelerate, questions emerge: to what extent are scientific discoveries based on p values reliable and reproducible? Should one adjust the significance level or find alternatives for the p value? Inspired by these questions and everlasting attempts to address them, here, we provide a systematic examination of the p value from its roles and merits to its misuses and misinterpretations. For the latter, we summarize modest recommendations to handle them. In parallel, we present the Bayesian alternatives for seeking evidence and discuss the pooling of p values from multiple studies and datasets. Overall, we argue that the p value and hypothesis testing form a useful probabilistic decision-making mechanism, facilitating causal inference, feature selection, and predictive modeling, but that the interpretation of the p value must be contextual, considering the scientific question, experimental design, and statistical principles.},

  abstract = {In young adult, the most common etiology of acute ischemic brain infarction are arterial dissections and cardiogenic embolic stroke. Vertebral artery dissection without preceding trauma history is quite rare in young ischemic stroke patients. Postural headache is even more atypical presentation for vertebral artery dissection. It is often misdiagnosed as spontaneous intracranial hypotension. We described a 37-year-old male suffering from acute onset postural headache with stroke in evolution during hospitalization. The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mislead to diagnosis of ischemic lesion. Nevertheless, with the aid of single photon emission computed tomography, we are confident the patient was afflicted with ischemic/hemorrhagic lesion, instead of neoplasm or demyelinating diseases. Lateral medullary syndrome was confirmed on the repeated brain MRI. His general condition improved with steady gait and clear articulation without easychoking after adequate hydration and rehabilitation training with aspirin as secondary prevention. Cranial artery dissections is a crucial differential diagnosis while thunderclap headache happens even related to postural change without obvious neurological deficit in the beginning presentations.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Autonomic disorders offer a fascinating view of the complexity of the nervous system. Their impact on human health ranges from benign to severe. Deciphering autonomic symptoms and signs draws on the cognitive skills and personal interest in the plight of patients that first attracted many physicians to the field of neurology. This article provides tools to sharpen those skills.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Autonomic neuroscience and accumulated clinical knowledge have led to the categorization of autonomic disorders into specific syndromes that can be identified on the basis of clinical phenotypes and physiologic responses to standardized stimuli in the autonomic laboratory. A key development has been the ability to distinguish neurogenic orthostatic hypotension from other causes of hypotension. Quantification of sudomotor responses has proven valuable in the diagnosis of thermoregulatory disorders and small fiber neuropathies such as those related to diabetes mellitus. Increasing attention has focused on autonomic failure as a defining feature of neurodegenerative {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathies, especially multiple system atrophy. As awareness of autonomic disorders has increased, the once obscure term                 dysautonomia                 has entered into common parlance.                                                        SUMMARY               With appropriate knowledge and experience, neurologists can diagnose autonomic dysfunction accurately and with confidence. The opportunity to play an important role in caring for patients with autonomic disorders is worth the effort.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Syncope is a prevalent syndrome with diverse causes, which have in common a sudden transient failure of the autonomic nervous system to maintain blood pressure against the force of gravity at a level sufficient for cerebral perfusion. Neurally mediated syncope is an episodic phenomenon in which autonomic nervous system function is normal the rest of the time. Although relatively benign, syncope increases the risk for injury from falling and can substantially impair patients' quality of life. Recognition of its various clinical presentations and knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology are essential for accurate diagnosis and successful management.                                         Recent Findings:               The most effective forms of treatment remain education of patients, avoidance of triggers, physical counterpressure maneuvers, and hydration or intravascular volume expansion. Pharmacologic interventions may be appropriate for some patients but, in general, have limited evidence of efficacy in preventing syncope. Based on the findings of a recent study, the possibility of pulmonary embolism should be considered in patients hospitalized for syncope, whether or not an alternative etiology for syncope is identified.                                         Summary:               This article focuses on the neurologic diagnosis, differential diagnosis, physiology, and management strategies for syncope, with an emphasis on neurally mediated syncope.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emerging research is revealing that direct physical contact of the human body with the surface of the earth (grounding or earthing) has intriguing effects on human physiology and health, including beneficial effects on various cardiovascular risk factors. This study examined effects of 2 hours of grounding on the electrical charge (zeta potential) on red blood cells (RBCs) and the effects on the extent of RBC clumping. DESIGN/INTERVENTIONS: SUBJECTS were grounded with conductive patches on the soles of their feet and palms of their hands. Wires connected the patches to a stainless-steel rod inserted in the earth outdoors. Small fingertip pinprick blood samples were placed on microscope slides and an electric field was applied to them. Electrophoretic mobility of the RBCs was determined by measuring terminal velocities of the cells in video recordings taken through a microscope. RBC aggregation was measured by counting the numbers of clustered cells in each sample. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Each subject sat in a comfortable reclining chair in a soundproof experiment room with the lights dimmed or off. SUBJECTS: Ten (10) healthy adult subjects were recruited by word-of-mouth. RESULTS: Earthing or grounding increased zeta potentials in all samples by an average of 2.70 and significantly reduced RBC aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: Grounding increases the surface charge on RBCs and thereby reduces blood viscosity and clumping. Grounding appears to be one of the simplest and yet most profound interventions for helping reduce cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular events.},

However, emerging scientific research has revealed a surprisingly positive and overlooked environmental factor on health: direct physical contact with the vast supply of electrons on the surface of the Earth. Modern lifestyle separates humans from such contact. The research suggests that this disconnect may be a major contributor to physiological dysfunction and unwellness. Reconnection with the Earth's electrons has been found to promote intriguing physiological changes and subjective reports of well-being. Earthing (or grounding) refers to the discovery of benefits-including better sleep and reduced pain-from walking barefoot outside or sitting, working, or sleeping indoors connected to conductive systems that transfer the Earth's electrons from the ground into the body.

PURPOSE: To determine the effects of grounding on massage therapists' quality of life and pain. Grounding, refers to being in direct body contact with the ground, such as walking barefoot on humid soil or on grass. SETTING: The Chopra Center for Well-Being in Carlsbad, California, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen massage therapists (mean age 42.8 years). RESEARCH DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: A stepped wedge cluster design was incorporated into a 6-week double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) procedure with massage therapists assigned randomly into one of two cohorts. Therapists were not grounded for the first week, were grounded while working on clients and at home while sleeping for the next four weeks, and then ungrounded for the last week. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prior to, during, and immediately following the intervention, participants completed standardized questionnaires reporting on pain, physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue/tiredness, sleep disturbance and number of hours of sleep, number of clients worked on per working day, energy, and emotional and mental stress. RESULTS: As a group, therapists experienced significant increases in physical function and energy and significant decreases in fatigue, depressed mood, tiredness and pain while grounded as compared to not being grounded. At one-month following the study, physical function was also increased and depressed mood and fatigue were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: We observed consistent beneficial effects of grounding in domains highly relevant to massage therapists, namely pain, physical function, and mood. These findings, combined with prior results from this trial indicating improvements in inflammatory biomarkers, blood viscosity and heart rate variability (HRV), suggest that grounding is beneficial to massage therapists in multiple domains relevant to their occupation, supporting overall health and quality of life.},

The research was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to evaluate studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in patients with stroke. The keywords for the search were: "stroke" AND "proprioception" OR "proprioceptive" AND "rehabilitation" OR "training" OR "exercises" AND "dual-task" OR "task-performance" with the following inclusion criteria: comparative studies of rehabilitation interventions with proprioceptive and dual-task exercises in stroke patients. Of the 104,014 studies identified, 23 were included according to the inclusion criteria. Proprioceptive and dual-task exercises stimulate and promote postural balance, gait, and quality of life and reduce the risk of falls in stroke patients compared with traditional rehabilitation programs. In conclusion, this systematic review suggests that proprioceptive exercise combined with dual-task training is needed to improve balance and recover gait. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on the various proprioceptive treatments with contextual dual-task exercises for imbalance after stroke, providing a guide for choosing a complete rehabilitation protocol that combines these two techniques.},

This article reviews the anatomy of the spinal cord and discusses how the clinical findings, time course, and radiographic patterns can help to identify the causes of myelopathy.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Imaging observations such as MRI ``pancake'' gadolinium enhancement pattern with spondylotic myelopathy and subpial enhancement with neurosarcoidosis have improved diagnostic specificity. On the other hand, common diseases such as degenerative spine disease are now recognized as presenting much more variably. Improved imaging and the identification of genetic markers enhance the specificity of diagnosis. The improved identification of biomarkers has shown that the same cause, such as compressive myelopathy, can present more variably than previously appreciated.                                         SUMMARY               Spinal cord dysfunction, or myelopathy, remains a clinical diagnosis, and determining the cause requires integration of clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters, none of which have great specificity individually. Most cases of myelopathy will require further neuroimaging, and some require CSF analysis for diagnosis. This article presents an approach to the diagnosis of myelopathy based on excluding compressive myelopathy initially and then differentiating between acute and subacute processes and chronic causes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dry sauna treatments improve the quality of life for chronic pain, congestive heart failure, and type 2 diabetes patients. This study aimed to determine whether dry sauna therapy improved the quality of life of obese people. METHODS: A total of 38 consecutive participants aged over 20 years with a body mass index of {$\geq$}25 kg/m2 were recruited for the study. The participants were treated with a 90{$^\circ$}C dry sauna for 15 minutes, twice daily for 4 consecutive days. To assess the quality of life, all participants completed the 5 level EQ-5D questionnaires and the EQ-Visual Analog Scale. Study parameters were measured on the same day prior to commencing the sauna sessions in a fasted state and 2 days after the last sauna session. RESULTS: The average age was 62.3{\textpm}9.5 years; 84.2\% of the participants were female. The mean body mass index was 28.5{\textpm}2.4 kg/m2. Dry sauna significantly improved the mean 5 level EQ-5D index scores from 0.83{\textpm}0.12 to 0.89{\textpm}0.11 and increased the mean EQ-Visual Analog Scale from 79.0{\textpm}15.2 to 91.1{\textpm}9.7. However, there were no significant changes in body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate, or body composition before and after the 8-session sauna therapy. CONCLUSION: Dry sauna improved the health-related quality of life of obese patients without adverse events. Further clinical studies in larger study populations are needed to verify these findings and provide concrete evidence for obesity treatment.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although most cases of severe headache are benign, it is essential to recognize the signs and symptoms of potentially life-threatening conditions. Patients with primary headache disorders can also acquire secondary conditions that may present as a change in their baseline headache patterns and characteristics. Clinical clues in the history and examination can help guide the diagnosis and management of secondary headache disorders. Furthermore, advances in the understanding of basic mechanisms of headache may offer insight into the proposed pathophysiology of secondary headaches.

This article uses a case-based approach to guide readers through the fundamental epidemiology and pathogenesis of SAH, the approach to diagnosis and management, the results of clinical trials and evidence to date, prognostic considerations, controversies, recent developments, and future directions in SAH.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Historically, management of SAH focused on prevention and treatment of subsequent cerebral vasospasm, which was thought to be the primary cause of delayed cerebral ischemia. Clinical and translational studies over the past decade, including several therapeutic phase 3 randomized clinical trials, suggest that the pathophysiology of SAH-associated brain injury is multiphasic and multifactorial beyond large vessel cerebral vasospasm. The quest to reduce SAH-associated brain injury and improve outcomes is shifting away from large vessel cerebral vasospasm to a new paradigm targeting multiple brain injury mechanisms, including early brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, spreading cortical depolarization, inflammation, and the brain-body interaction in vascular brain injury with critical illness.               Despite multiple negative randomized clinical trials in search of potential therapeutic agents ameliorating the downstream effects after SAH, the overall outcome of SAH has improved over recent decades, likely related to improvements in interventional options for ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in critical care management. Emerging clinical evidence also suggests potential harmful impact of historic empiric treatments for SAH-associated vasospasm, such as prophylactic induction of hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution (triple H therapy).               With decreasing mortality, long-term SAH survivorship and efforts to reduce chronic morbidity and to improve quality of life and patient-centered outcome are growing areas of unmet need. Despite existing guidelines, significant variabilities in local and regional practices and in scientific terminologies have historically limited advancement in SAH care and therapeutic development. Large global collaborative efforts developed harmonized SAH common data elements in 2019, and studies are under way to examine how existing variabilities in SAH care impact long-term SAH outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Although the overall incidence and mortality of SAH is decreasing with advances in preventive and acute care, SAH remains a major cause of long-term morbidity in survivors. Significant variabilities in care settings and empiric treatment protocols and inconsistent scientific terminologies have limited advancement in patient care and therapeutic clinical studies. Large consensus efforts are under way to introduce clinical guidelines and common data elements to advance therapeutic approaches and improve patient outcome.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Brain abscesses and spinal epidural abscesses are serious, potentially life-threatening infections of the central nervous system. This article outlines the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of brain abscesses and spinal epidural abscesses, with a specific focus on bacterial infections.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The overall incidence of brain abscesses has declined, in part because of fewer brain abscesses associated with otogenic infections. However, emerging patient populations at high risk for brain abscess include those with a history of penetrating head trauma, neurosurgery, or immunodeficiency. Improved mortality rates for brain abscess are attributable to modern diagnostic imaging, stereotactic-guided aspiration, and newer antimicrobials that readily penetrate into the central nervous system and abscesses. Brain MRI is more sensitive than CT for brain abscess, particularly in the early stages, but CT remains more widely available and can adequately identify potential abscesses and confirm response to treatment. With the advent of minimally invasive neurosurgical techniques, surgical excision is often employed only for posterior fossa, multiloculated, or superficial well-circumscribed abscesses. In select clinical scenarios, conservative medical management may be a safe alternative to a combined surgical and medical approach. Unlike brain abscess, the incidence of spinal epidural abscess is on the rise and has been attributed to higher prevalence of predisposing factors, including spinal procedures and instrumentation.                                         SUMMARY               Successful diagnosis and management of brain abscess and spinal epidural abscess requires a collaborative approach among neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. The foundation of management of brain abscess includes surgical intervention for diagnostic purposes if a pathogen has not been identified or for decompression of larger abscesses or those with mass effect and significant surrounding edema; appropriate dosing and adequate duration of an antimicrobial regimen tailored to the presumptive source of infection and available culture data, and eradication of the primary source of infection. For spinal epidural abscesses, neurologic status at the time of presentation is directly related to outcomes, underscoring the importance of prompt recognition and intervention.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis, the sexually transmissible stages of infection, has been on the rise for the past 2 decades. A concerning recent trend is the surge in cases of syphilis in women and of congenital syphilis. Neurosyphilis remains a relatively common complication that can occur at any stage of syphilis. Along with meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, which has been historically described as a late presentation of neurosyphilis, now frequently occurs as a manifestation of early infection. Late forms of neurosyphilis, including tabes dorsalis and general paresis, are less prevalent in the era of widespread penicillin use. As more laboratories adopt the reverse-sequence algorithm for syphilis testing, patients with serodiscordant results (ie, a reactive serum treponemal test with a nonreactive nontreponemal test) may present an increasingly encountered diagnostic challenge for neurologists. Although the CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) remains a mainstay of diagnostic testing for neurosyphilis, using a higher titer cutoff (greater than 1:320) for the                 Treponema pallidum                 particle agglutination assay (TPPA) from the CSF may improve the utility of the TPPA as a supporting criterion for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Penicillin G is the treatment of choice for neurosyphilis, although ceftriaxone may be a reasonable alternative therapy.                                                        SUMMARY               A high index of suspicion and awareness of the variable clinical presentations of neurosyphilis are essential to the approach to this treatable infection. Neurologists should be mindful of the limitations of serologic testing in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis and exercise clinical judgment to determine the likelihood of the diagnosis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Acute as well as chronic pain syndromes are common after whiplash trauma and exercise therapy is proposed as one possible intervention strategy. The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effect of exercise therapy in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders for the improvement of neck pain and neck disability, compared with other therapeutic interventions, placebo interventions, no treatment, or waiting list. CONTENT: The review was registered in Prospero (CRD42017060356) and conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A literature search in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane from inception until January 13, 2020 was combined with a hand search to identify eligible randomized controlled studies. Abstract screening, full text assessment and risk of bias assessment (Cochrane RoB 2.0) were conducted by two independent reviewers. SUMMARY: The search identified 4,103 articles. After removal of duplicates, screening of 2,921 abstracts and full text assessment of 100 articles, 27 articles that reported data for 2,127 patients were included. The included articles evaluated the effect of exercise therapy on neck pain, neck disability or other outcome measures and indicated some positive effects from exercise, but many studies lacked control groups not receiving active treatment. Studies on exercise that could be included in the random-effect meta-analysis showed significant short-term effects on neck pain and medium-term effects on neck disability. OUTLOOK: Despite a large number of articles published in the area of exercise therapy and Whiplash-Associated Disorders, the current evidence base is weak. The results from the present review with meta-analysis suggests that exercise therapy may provide additional effect for improvement of neck pain and disability in patients with Whiplash-Associated Disorders.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although prior studies suggested women have worse outcomes after stroke, it is now clear that age, prestroke functional status, and comorbidities explain many of the differences between men and women in stroke severity, functional outcomes, and mortality. Several meta-analyses and large cohort studies have evaluated the risk factors for women related to reproductive factors and found that fewer years between menarche and menopause, pregnancy complications (preeclampsia/eclampsia, preterm delivery, and stillbirth), oophorectomy, hormone replacement therapy use, and younger age at menopause all increase the risk of stroke. Although the nonreproductive risks of stroke overlap between men and women, those with greater impact on women include age, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, socioeconomic status, and depression.

This is a case report of a 39-year-old male sports coach who presented with low back pain, right orchialgia, and sciatica refractory to conservative management. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed disc protrusion at L3/L4 and L4/L5 levels. Positive outcomes in relieving back and testicular pain were obtained after a total of 30 chiropractic sessions over a 9-week period. The evidence of the subjective improvement was corroborated by regression of the herniated discs documented on the repeat MR imaging. While chronic orchialgia is not an uncommon problem for men of all ages, it has seldom been described in association with lumbar discogenic disease. The current study provided preliminary support for a link between orchialgia and lumbar disc herniation.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes fluctuating weakness in ocular, bulbar, and limb muscles and can, in 15\% of cases, cause myasthenic crisis, a neurologic emergency characterized by respiratory failure. Although infrequent, MG needs to be promptly recognized and treated because the potential for improvement and remission is very high. The diagnosis of MG can be challenging and delayed because of the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness and the overlap of signs and symptoms with other neuromuscular diseases.               This article reviews the importance of prompt recognition of the typical signs and symptoms, best tests to confirm the diagnosis, currently available acute and chronic treatment modalities, the role of thymectomy, and the natural history of the disease. Special consideration related to the diagnosis and management in women during pregnancy and in children will also be reviewed. This article also includes an overview of congenital myasthenic syndromes.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent significant efforts in standardizing and improving the care of patients with MG have occurred, as well as new momentum in developing new drugs for patients with MG who do not adequately respond to currently available treatments. The number of clinical trials and drugs in development for MG is steadily increasing. Eculizumab has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor--antibody positive, based on the REGAIN (Safety and Efficacy of Eculizumab in Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis) study, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. An international, multicenter, randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone has demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcome in patients with nonthymomatous MG. Clinical care guidelines have been published, and the recommendations for clinical research standards and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America MGFA clinical classification published in 2000 have become widely accepted by the clinical and research community of MG experts.                                         SUMMARY               MG is a highly treatable disease with many effective treatment modalities available and with a natural history that continues to improve thanks to better diagnostic tests and effective drugs. The diagnosis and management of patients affected by MG can be highly rewarding for any neurologist as most patients are able to live normal lives if treated appropriately. Nevertheless, future research is needed to address unresolved clinical issues, such as when and how to discontinue immunosuppressive medications in patients in remission, the role and timing of thymectomy in children, and better treatment options for refractory patients.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) can present with diverse clinical manifestations, and the clinical care required is complex and requires a thoughtful approach to emerging symptoms and treatment decisions.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Even though it is a rare disease, MSA is often encountered in clinical practice. New developments in biofluid biomarkers and diagnostic assessments offer potential for earlier and more accurate diagnosis. This article describes recent findings, such as the use of skin biopsies, neuroimaging, and novel treatment concepts (eg, central noradrenergic augmentation).                                         SUMMARY               MSA is a complex disease. This article provides a summary of treatment options for diverse symptoms that include autonomic, sleep, mood, and motor manifestations of the disease to help clinicians care for patients with MSA. Providing comprehensive care for patients with MSA requires an understanding of the diverse symptomatology that patients develop over time and should include an interdisciplinary team.},

  abstract = {The microbiota-gut-brain axis or simple gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex and interactive bidirectional communication network linking the gut to the brain. Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome have been linked to GBA dysfunction, central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, and dopaminergic degeneration, as those occurring in Parkinson's disease (PD). Besides inflammation, the activation of brain microglia is known to play a central role in the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Inflammation is attributed to the toxic effect of aggregated {$\alpha$}-synuclein, in the brain of PD patients. It has been suggested that the {$\alpha$}-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread "prion-like", via the vagus nerve into the lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain, known as the Braak hypothesis. In this review, we discuss how the microbiota-gut-brain axis and environmental influences interact with the immune system to promote a pro-inflammatory state that is involved in the initiation and progression of misfolded {$\alpha$}-synuclein proteins and the beginning of the early non-motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, we describe a speculative bidirectional model that explains how the enteric glia is involved in the initiation and spreading of inflammation, epithelial barrier disruption, and {$\alpha$}-synuclein misfolding, finally reaching the central nervous system and contributing to neuroinflammatory processes involved with the initial non-motor symptoms of PD.},

In addition to their clinical use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CD34(+) cells may also promote therapeutic neovascularization. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence circulating CD34(+) cell frequency has wide implications for vascular biology in addition to stem cell transplantation. In the present study, we examined the clinical and genetic characteristics associated with circulating CD34(+) cell frequency in a large, community-based sample of 1786 Framingham Heart Study participants.Among subjects without cardiovascular disease (n = 1595), CD34(+) frequency was inversely related to older age, female sex, and smoking. CD34(+) frequency was positively related to weight, serum total cholesterol, and statin therapy. Clinical covariates accounted for 6.3\% of CD34(+) variability. CD34(+) frequency was highly heritable (h(2) = 54\%; P {$<$} .0001). Genome-wide association analysis of CD34(+) frequency identified suggestive associations at several loci, including OR4C12 (chromosome 11; P = 6.7 {\texttimes} 10(-7)) and ENO1 and RERE (chromosome 1; P = 8.8 {\texttimes} 10(-7)). CD34(+) cell frequency is reduced in older subjects and is influenced by environmental factors including smoking and statin use. CD34(+) frequency is highly heritable. The results of the present study have implications for therapies that use CD34(+) cell populations and support efforts to better understand the genetic mechanisms that underlie CD34(+) frequency.},

Over the past decade, advances in genetic testing have revolutionized patient evaluation. The main goal of this review is to give the clinician the basic understanding to recognize patients at risk of these diseases using the standard history and physical examination.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Primary mitochondrial disease                 is the current designation for the illnesses resulting from genetic mutations in genes whose protein products are necessary for mitochondrial structure or function. In most circumstances, more than one organ system is involved in mitochondrial disease, and the value of the classic clinical features as originally described early in the history of mitochondrial diseases has reemerged as being important to identifying patients who may have a primary mitochondrial disease. The use of the genetic laboratory has become the most powerful tool for confirming a diagnosis, and nuances of using genetic results will be discussed in this article. Treatment for mitochondrial disease is symptomatic, with less emphasis on vitamin and supplement therapy than in the past. Clinical trials using pharmacologic agents are in progress, with the field attempting to define proper goals of treatment. Several standard accepted therapies exist for many of the metabolic myopathies.                                                        SUMMARY               Mitochondrial, lipid, and glycogen diseases are not uncommon causes of multisystem organ dysfunction, with the neurologic features, especially myopathy, occurring as a predominant feature. Early recognition requires basic knowledge of the varied clinical phenotypes before moving forward with a screening evaluation and possibly a genetic evaluation. Aside from a few specific diseases for which there are recommended interventions, treatment for the majority of  these disorders remains symptomatic, with clinical trials currently in progress that will hopefully result in standard treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis is often identified as a potential etiologic cause for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. Given the high prevalence of large artery atherosclerosis in the general population, determining whether an identified atherosclerotic lesion is truly the cause of a patient's symptomatology can be difficult. In all cases, optimally treating each patient to minimize future stroke risk is paramount. Extracranial or intracranial large artery atherosclerosis can be broadly compartmentalized into four distinct clinical scenarios based upon the individual patient's history, examination, and anatomic imaging findings: asymptomatic and symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis, intracranial atherosclerosis, and extracranial vertebral artery atherosclerotic disease. This review provides a framework for clinicians evaluating and treating such patients.                                         Recent Findings:               Intensive medical therapy achieves low rates of stroke and death in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Evidence indicates that patients with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis should undergo carotid revascularization sooner rather than later and that the risk of stroke or death is lower using carotid endarterectomy than with carotid stenting. Specific to stenting, the risk of stroke or death is greatest among older patients and women. Continuous vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy is the mainstay for stroke prevention in the setting of intracranial and vertebral artery origin atherosclerosis.                                         Summary:               Lifelong vascular risk factor optimization via sustained behavioral modifications and intensive medical therapy are the key elements to reduce future stroke risk in the setting of large artery atherosclerosis. When considering a revascularization procedure for carotid stenosis, patient demographics, comorbidities, and the periprocedural risks of stroke and death should be carefully considered.},

METHODS: This narrative review combines scientific evidence with clinical guidelines based on the current literature to highlight the different components of the rehabilitation of glenohumeral instability. RESULTS: Depending on the specific characteristics of the instability pattern, the severity, recurrence, and direction, the therapeutic approach may be adapted to the needs and demands of the athlete. In general, attention should go to (1) restoration of rotator cuff strength and inter-muscular balance, focusing on the eccentric capacity of the external rotators, (2) normalization of rotational range of motion with special attention to the internal rotation ROM, (3) optimization of the flexibility and muscle performance of the scapular muscles, and (4) gradually increasing the functional sport-specific load on the shoulder girdle. The functional kinetic chain should be implemented throughout all stages of the rehabilitation program. Return to play should be based on subjective assessment as well as objective measurements of ROM, strength, and function. CONCLUSIONS: This paper summarizes evidence-based guidelines for treatment of glenohumeral instability. These guidelines may assist the clinician in the prevention and rehabilitation of the overhead athlete. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Expert opinion, Level V.},

Patients with striatal, but not frontal lobe lesions, were impaired in switching between concrete sensory stimuli. By contrast, both patient groups were unimpaired when switching between abstract task rules relative to baseline nonswitch trials.

RECENT FINDINGS               Disorders of thermoregulation and sweating may manifest with hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis/anhidrosis. Primary disorders of hyperhidrosis may significantly impact quality of life yet tend to be benign. Many sweating disorders present with compensatory hyperhidrosis due to areas of anhidrosis. Anhidrosis may occur due to either central or peripheral damage to the autonomic nervous system. The thermoregulatory control of sweating involves central pathways from the hypothalamus to the brainstem and then spinal cord as well as projections to peripheral structures, including the sympathetic chain ganglia, peripheral nerves, and eccrine sweat glands. Disruption at any point of this pathway may lead to impaired sweating. Characterization of sweating dysfunction helps localize different autonomic disorders to guide diagnosis and may allow for evaluation of treatment effect.                                         SUMMARY               Sweating dysfunction manifests in myriad ways, including essential hyperhidrosis, complete anhidrosis with heat intolerance, and compensatory hyperhidrosis due to anhidrosis, and often indicates involvement of underlying central or peripheral autonomic dysfunction.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The pattern and severity of autonomic involvement in the synucleinopathies is related to differences in cellular deposition and neuronal populations affected by {$\alpha$}-synuclein aggregation, which influences the degree and manifestation of autonomic failure. Clinical and laboratory autonomic features distinguish the different synucleinopathies based on pattern and severity. These features also determine which patients are at risk for evolution from pure autonomic failure to the synucleinopathies with prominent motor involvement, such as multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, or Parkinson disease.

  abstract = {The present study investigated the activation of gluteal, thigh, and lower back muscles in different squat variations. Ten male competitive bodybuilders perform back-squat at full (full-BS) or parallel (parallel-BS) depth, using large feet-stance (sumo-BS), and enhancing the feet external rotation (external-rotated-sumo-BS) and front-squat (FS) at 80\% 1-RM. The normalized surface electromyographic root-mean-square (sEMG RMS) amplitude of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, adductor longus, longissimus, and iliocostalis was recorded during both the ascending and descending phase of each exercise. During the descending phase, greater sEMG RMS amplitude of gluteus maximus and gluteus medius was found in FS vs. all other exercises (p {$<$} 0.05). Additionally, FS elicited iliocostalis more than all other exercises. During the ascending phase, both sumo-BS and external-rotated-sumo-BS showed greater vastus lateralis and adductor longus activation compared to all other exercises (p {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, rectus femoris activation was greater in FS compared to full-BS (p {$<$} 0.05). No between-exercise difference was found in vastus medialis and longissimus showed no between-exercise difference. FS needs more backward stabilization during the descending phase. Larger feet-stance increases thigh muscles activity, possibly because of their longer length. These findings show how bodybuilders uniquely recruit muscles when performing different squat variations.},

These disorders are not merely historical curiosities, however. As apraxia, neglect, and agnosia have important clinical implications, it is important to possess a working knowledge of the conditions and how to identify them.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Apraxia is a disorder of skilled action that is frequently observed in the setting of dominant hemisphere pathology, whether from stroke or neurodegenerative disorders. In contrast to some previous teaching, apraxia has clear clinical relevance as it is associated with poor recovery from stroke. Neglect is a complex disorder with many different manifestations that may have different underlying mechanisms. Neglect is, in the author's view, a multicomponent disorder in which impairment in attention and arousal is a major contributor. Finally, agnosias come in a wide variety of forms, reflecting impairments ranging from low-level sensory processing to access to stored knowledge of the world (semantics).                                         SUMMARY               The classic behavioral disorders reviewed here were of immense interest to early neurologists because of their arresting clinical phenomenology; more recent investigations have done much to advance the neuroscientific understanding of the disorders and to reveal their clinical relevance.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of the pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG autoantibody and characterization of NMOSD as an autoimmune astrocytopathy have spearheaded the identification of key immunologic therapeutic targets in this disease, including but not limited to the complement system, the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, and B cells. Accordingly, four recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of three new NMOSD therapies, namely eculizumab, satralizumab, and inebilizumab.                                         SUMMARY               Currently, NMOSD poses both diagnostic and treatment challenges. It is debated whether individuals who are seropositive for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG belong within the neuromyelitis optica spectrum. This discussion is fueled by disparities in treatment responses between patients who are AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative, suggesting different immunopathologic mechanisms may govern these conditions. As our understanding regarding the immune pathophysiology of NMOSD expands, emerging biomarkers, including serum neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), may facilitate earlier relapse detection and inform long-term treatment decisions. Future research focal points should include strategies to optimize relapse management, restorative treatments that augment neurologic recovery, and practical solutions that promote equitable access to approved therapies for all patients with NMOSD.},

Recent Findings:               Up to a 10\% risk of recurrent stroke exists after a TIA, and up to 80\% of this risk is preventable with urgent assessment and treatment. Imaging of the brain and intracranial and extracranial blood vessels using CT, CT angiography, carotid Doppler ultrasound, and MRI is an important part of the diagnostic assessment. Treatment options include anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, carotid revascularization for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, antiplatelet therapy, and vascular risk factor reduction strategies.

An understanding of specific muscles affected will help guide targeted rehabilitation. Objectives of this case-control study were to compare gluteal and tensor fasciae latae (TFL) muscle size and quality (fatty infiltration) in women with symptomatic GTPS to asymptomatic age-matched female controls. Magnetic resonance imaging of 16 women with GTPS (mean age 55.75\,years, range 23-69) and 15 asymptomatic controls (mean age 55.60\,years, range 31-66) was undertaken. Muscle volumes of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and TFL were calculated. Fatty infiltration was rated using the Goutallier classification system for all muscles in their entirety, as well as anterior and posterior segments of gluteus medius and minimus. Muscle volumes and fatty infiltration were compared between groups. Significantly smaller muscle volumes were identified in the symptomatic group for the upper (P =\,0.01) and lower (P =\,0.04) portions of gluteus maximus, gluteus medius (P =\,0.03), and gluteus minimus (P =\,0.02). There was no difference in TFL (P =\,0.18). Symptomatic participants displayed significantly greater fatty infiltration in gluteus maximus upper (P =\,0.021) and lower (P =\,0.049) when adjusted for BMI, and gluteus minimus (P =\,0.018), particularly in the posterior portion (P =\,0.04). Anterior gluteus minimus demonstrated high amounts of fatty infiltration in both groups. Gluteal muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration in women with GTPS suggests gluteus maximus and minimus may be an important target for rehabilitation. Clin.

Maximal strength training improves surfboard sprint and endurance paddling performance in competitive and recreational surfers. J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 244-253, 2017-Upper-body (UB) strength has very high correlations with faster surfboard paddling speeds. However, there is no research examining the effects of improving UB strength has on surfboard paddling ability. This study aimed to determine the influence that improvements in UB closed-kinetic chain maximal strength have on surfboard paddling in both competitive and recreational surfers. Seventeen competitive and recreational male surfers (29.7 {\textpm} 7.7 years, 177.4 {\textpm} 7.4 cm, 76.7 {\textpm} 9.9 kg) participated in a repeated-measures, parallel control study design. Anthropometry; 5-, 10-, and 15-m sprint; and 400-m endurance surfboard paddling tests along with pull-up and dip 1 repetition maximum strength tests were assessed pre- and postintervention. Subjects in the training group performed 5 weeks of maximal strength training in the pull-up and dip. Differences between the training and control groups were examined postintervention. The training group increased their speed over the 5-, 10-, and 15-m sprint, whereas the control group became slower (d = 0.71, 0.51, and 0.4, respectively). The training group also displayed faster endurance paddling performance compared with the control group (d = 0.72). Short-term exposure to maximal strength training elicits improvements in paddling performance measures. However, the magnitude of performance increases seems to be dependent on initial strength levels with differential responses between strong and weaker athletes. Although a longer maximal strength training period may have produced more significant paddling improvements in stronger subjects, practitioners are unlikely to have any more than 5 weeks in an uninterrupted block with competitive surfing athletes. This study reveals that a "threshold" level of maximal strength that if possessed, short-term maximal strength training may only provide little improvement in paddling performance.},

These therapies contrast with acute stroke treatments such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and thrombectomy that target clots, aim to salvage threatened brain tissue to limit injury, and have a time window measured in hours. Restorative therapies target the brain, aim to promote plasticity within surviving brain tissue, and have a time window measured in days to weeks or longer.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               A number of drugs are under study. Preclinical studies are providing attractive therapeutic candidates for translation, such as the C-C chemokine receptor 5 inhibitor maraviroc. Some drug studies have used a pragmatic approach, which is premature for the nascent field of neural repair. Substantial data support the utility of activity-dependent therapies, including constraint-induced movement therapy, with recent studies supporting the need for very high doses to generate the best functional gains. While stem cell therapies are at an early stage, mounting preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells; some initial human studies are supportive. Several types of brain stimulation have been examined, and in some cases initial studies are promising.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are commonly reported by individuals with chronic pain. However, little is known about how ACE exposure influences treatment outcomes. The goal of the current study was to evaluate group and treatment-related differences among adults with varying levels of ACE exposure participating in a pain rehabilitation treatment program. METHODS: Adult participants (N=269) were categorized as 0 ACEs (n=65), 1 to 2 ACEs (n=87), or {$\geq$}3 ACEs (n=117). Participants completed self-report measures of pain, physical functioning, and psychosocial functioning at intake and discharge from a 10-week interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. RESULTS: ACE exposure was frequently endorsed in this sample, with the majority of participants (78.5\%) reporting at least 1 form of childhood adversity. Adults in the {$\geq$}3 ACEs group reported a greater level of impairment in mental health symptoms and adjustment to chronic pain; however, all groups endorsed treatment improvements and there were no differences in response to treatment. There were also no differences between groups on measures of pain or physical functioning at intake or discharge. DISCUSSION: ACE exposure appears common among treatment-seeking adults with chronic pain and is associated with increased clinical complexity. However, adults with and without exposure to ACEs endorsed significant improvements in pain and functioning following participation in an interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation program. This model of treatment may be especially well situated to address the biopsychosocial contributions to pain among those with a history of adversity.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases searched in August 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any injury prevention programme (eg, exercise, education, braces) were included. Study inclusion criteria were: {$\geq$}20 female football players in each study arm (any age, football code or participation level) and injury incidence reporting. RESULTS: Twelve studies, all in soccer, met inclusion criteria, with nine involving adolescent teams (aged {$<$}18 years). All studies (except one) had a high risk of bias. Eleven studies examined exercise-based programmes, with most (9/11) including multiple ({$\geq$}2) training components (eg, strength, plyometric, balance exercises). Multicomponent exercise programmes reduced overall (any reported) injuries (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.73, 95\%\,CI 0.59 to 0.91) and ACL injuries (IRR 0.55, 95\%\,CI 0.32 to 0.92). For exercise-based strategies (single-component and multicomponent), hamstring injuries were also reduced (IRR 0.40, 95\%\,CI 0.17 to 0.95). While exercise-based strategies resulted in less knee, ankle and hip/groin injuries, and the use of multiple training components was associated with greater reductions in overall and knee injuries, further studies would be required to increase the precision of these results. The incidence of overall injuries in women's football was 3.4 per 1000 exposure hours; with ankle injuries most common. CONCLUSION: In women's football, there is low-level evidence that multicomponent, exercise-based programmes reduce overall and ACL injuries by 27\% and 45\%, respectively.

RECENT FINDINGS               The armamentarium of immunotherapies has grown rapidly, to encompass 19 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunotherapies available in 2021, which are addressed in the review. The coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020 underscored existing concerns regarding vaccine efficacy in those treated with immune-suppressing immunotherapies, which are also addressed here.                                         SUMMARY               By choosing a treatment strategy before exploring the individual medications, patients and providers can focus their efforts on a subset of the therapeutic options. Although the mechanisms of action, routes of administration, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the described agents and classes differ, all are effective in reducing relapse frequency in multiple sclerosis (MS), with most also showing a reduction in the accumulation of neurologic disability. These powerful effects are improving the lives of people with MS. Pharmacovigilance is critical for the safe use of these immune-modulating and -suppressing agents, and vaccine efficacy may be reduced by those with immune-suppressing effects.},

Recent Findings:               Currently, a worldwide controversy exists regarding the classification, diagnostic process, and surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. This controversy has been caused on one side by the recognition that some 50\% of patients with trigeminal neuralgia, apart from characteristic paroxysmal attacks, also have continuous pain in the same territory, which results in greater diagnostic difficulties and is associated with a lower response to medical and surgical treatments. In contrast, recent developments in MRI methods allow differentiation between a mere neurovascular contact and an effective compression of the trigeminal root by an anomalous vessel, which implies more difficulties in the choice of surgical treatment, with the indication for microvascular decompression becoming more restricted.                                         Summary:               This article proposes that the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia, with or without concomitant continuous pain, must rely on clinical grounds only. Diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish three etiologic categories: idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (nothing is found), classic trigeminal neuralgia (an anomalous vessel produces morphologic changes of the trigeminal root near its entry into the pons), and secondary trigeminal neuralgia (due to major neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis or tumors at the cerebellopontine angle). Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine (ie, voltage-gated, frequency-dependent sodium channel blockers) are still the first-choice medical treatment, although many patients experience significant side effects, and those with concomitant continuous pain respond less well to treatment. The development of sodium channel blockers that are selective for the sodium channel 1.7 (Na               v               1.7) receptor will hopefully help. Although all the surgical interventions (percutaneous ganglion lesions, gamma knife radiosurgery, and microvascular decompression) are very efficacious, precise MRI criteria for differentiating a real neurovascular compression from an irrelevant contact will be of benefit in better selecting patients for microvascular decompression.},

  abstract = {Upper limb amputation can result in significant functional impairment necessitating a comprehensive rehabilitation approach throughout the continuum of care. In 2022, the Departments of Veteran Affairs and Defense completed an updated clinical practice guideline for the management of upper limb amputation rehabilitation. This practice guideline was developed by a workgroup of subject-matter experts from a variety of disciplines. Twelve key questions were developed by the workgroup using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing of outcomes measurement, and setting) format to establish the scope of the literature review. Eighteen recommendations were developed through extensive review of the available literature and use of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. The strength of each recommendation was determined based on the quality of the research evidence and the additional domains of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. Of the 18 recommendations, 4 were found to have sufficient evidence to suggest for use of a particular rehabilitation management strategy. Thus, the 2022 Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense clinical practice guideline provides updated, evidence-based information on the care and rehabilitation of persons with upper limb amputation. However, a significant lack of high-quality evidence in upper limb amputation rehabilitation limited evidence-based clinical guidance to assist healthcare providers in managing this population.},

DESIGN: Overview of systematic reviews with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation certainty of evidence. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials investigating rehabilitation interventions following ACL and/or meniscal tears in young adults. RESULTS: We included 22 systematic reviews (142 trials of mostly men) evaluating ACL-injured individuals and none evaluating isolated meniscal injuries. We synthesised data from 16 reviews evaluating 12 different interventions. Moderate-certainty evidence was observed for: (1) neuromuscular electrical stimulation to improve quadriceps strength; (2) open versus closed kinetic chain exercises to be similarly effective for quadriceps strength and self-reported function; (3) structured home-based versus structured in-person rehabilitation to be similarly effective for quadriceps and hamstring strength and self-reported function; and (4) postoperative knee bracing being ineffective for physical function and laxity. There was low-certainty evidence that: (1) preoperative exercise therapy improves self-reported and physical function postoperatively; (2) cryotherapy reduces pain and analgesic use; (3) psychological interventions improve anxiety/fear; and (4) whole body vibration improves quadriceps strength. There was very low-certainty evidence that: (1) protein-based supplements improve quadriceps size; (2) blood flow restriction training improves quadriceps size; (3) neuromuscular control exercises improve quadriceps and hamstring strength and self-reported function; and (4) continuous passive motion has no effect on range of motion. CONCLUSION: The general level of evidence for rehabilitation after ACL or meniscal tear was low. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that several rehabilitation types can improve quadriceps strength, while brace use has no effect on knee function/laxity.},

Instead, it is the theoretical distribution of the sample mean or the theoretical distribution of the difference between sample means that must be roughly normal. The most versatile approach to assess normality is to bootstrap the sample mean, the difference between sample means, or t itself. We can then assess whether the distributions of these bootstrap statistics are consistent with a normal distribution by studying their normal quantile plots. If we suspect that an inference we make from a t test may not be justified-if we suspect that the theoretical distribution of the sample mean or the theoretical distribution of the difference between sample means is not normal-then we can use a permutation method to analyze our data.},

If we obtain an experimental result that is scientifically meaningful and statistically unusual, we would like to know that our result reflects a general biological phenomenon that another researcher could reproduce if (s)he repeated our experiment. But more often than not, we may learn this researcher cannot replicate our result. The National Institutes of Health and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology have created training modules and outlined strategies to help improve the reproducibility of research. These particular approaches are necessary, but they are not sufficient. The principles of hypothesis testing and estimation are inherent to the notion of reproducibility in science. If we want to improve the reproducibility of our research, then we need to rethink how we apply fundamental concepts of statistics to our science.},

Original articles published in 1996 by the American Physiological Society's journals fared no better in their handling of basic statistical concepts. In this review, we summarize the two main scientific uses of statistics: hypothesis testing and estimation. Most scientists use statistics solely for hypothesis testing; often, however, estimation is more useful. We also illustrate the concepts of variability and uncertainty, and we demonstrate the essential distinction between statistical significance and scientific importance. An understanding of concepts such as variability, uncertainty, and significance is necessary, but it is not sufficient; we show also that the numerical results of statistical analyses have limitations.},

The P value associated with the magnitude of that test statistic answers this question: if the null hypothesis is true, what proportion of possible values of the test statistic are at least as extreme as the one I got? Although statisticians continue to stress the limitations of hypothesis tests, there are two realities we must acknowledge: hypothesis tests are ingrained within science, and the simple test of a null hypothesis can be useful. As a result, it behooves us to explore the notions of hypothesis tests, test statistics, and P values.},

This thirteenth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the log transformation, an established technique that rescales the actual observations from an experiment so that the assumptions of some statistical analysis are better met. A general assumption in statistics is that the variability of some response Y is homogeneous across groups or across some predictor variable X. If the variability-the standard deviation-varies in rough proportion to the mean value of Y, a log transformation can equalize the standard deviations. Moreover, if the actual observations from an experiment conform to a skewed distribution, then a log transformation can make the theoretical distribution of the sample mean more consistent with a normal distribution. This is important: the results of a one-sample t test are meaningful only if the theoretical distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal. If we log-transform our observations, then we want to confirm the transformation was useful. We can do this if we use the Box-Cox method, if we bootstrap the sample mean and the statistic t itself, and if we assess the residual plots from the statistical model of the actual and transformed sample observations.},

In physiology, experiments that involve multiple comparisons are common: of the original articles published in 1997 by the American Physiological Society, approximately 40\% cite a multiple comparison procedure. In this review, I demonstrate the statistical issue embedded in multiple comparisons, and I summarize the philosophies of handling this issue. I also illustrate the three procedures-Newman-Keuls, Bonferroni, least significant difference-cited most often in my literature review; each of these procedures is of limited practical value.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched until February 2022. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised trials that included healthy adults, compared at least 2 predefined conditions (non-exercise control (CTRL) and 12 RTx, differentiated by load, sets and/or weekly frequency), and reported muscle strength and/or hypertrophy were included. ANALYSES: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis methodology was used to compare RTxs and CTRL. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve values were used to rank conditions. Confidence was assessed with threshold analysis. RESULTS: The strength network included 178 studies (n=5097; women=45\%). The hypertrophy network included 119 studies (n=3364; women=47\%). All RTxs were superior to CTRL for muscle strength and hypertrophy. Higher-load ({$>$}80\% of single repetition maximum) prescriptions maximised strength gains, and all prescriptions comparably promoted muscle hypertrophy. While the calculated effects of many prescriptions were similar, higher-load, multiset, thrice-weekly training (standardised mean difference (95\% credible interval); 1.60 (1.38 to 1.82) vs CTRL) was the highest-ranked RTx for strength, and higher-load, multiset, twice-weekly training (0.66 (0.47 to 0.85) vs CTRL) was the highest-ranked RTx for hypertrophy. Threshold analysis demonstrated these results were extremely robust. CONCLUSION: All RTx promoted strength and hypertrophy compared with no exercise. The highest-ranked prescriptions for strength involved higher loads, whereas the highest-ranked prescriptions for hypertrophy included multiple sets.

RECENT FINDINGS               POTS is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by several pathophysiologic mechanisms that may coexist (limited autonomic neuropathy, hyperadrenergic state, hypovolemia, venous pooling, joint hypermobility, deconditioning). Neurally mediated syncope occurs despite intact autonomic reflexes. Management of orthostatic intolerance aims to increase functional capacity, including standing time, performance of daily activities, and exercise tolerance. Nonpharmacologic strategies (fluid and salt loading, physical countermaneuvers, compression garments, exercise training) are fundamental for patients with POTS, occasionally complemented by medications to raise blood pressure or slow heart rate. Neurally mediated syncope is best managed by recognition and avoidance of triggers.                                         SUMMARY               Significant negative effects on quality of life occur in patients with POTS and in patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope, which can be mitigated through targeted evaluation and thoughtful management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As one of the purposes of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is to return athletes to their preinjury activity level, it is critical to understand variables influencing return to sport. Associations between return to sport and variables representing knee impairment, function and psychological status have not been well studied in athletes following ACLR. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to summarise the literature reporting on variables proposed to be associated with return to sport following ACLR. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched for articles published before November 2012. Articles included in this review met these criteria: (1) included patients with primary ACLR, (2) reported at least one knee impairment, function or psychological measure, (3) reported a return to sport measure and (4) analysed the relationship between the measure and return to sport. RESULTS: Weak evidence existed in 16 articles suggesting variables associated with return to sport included higher quadriceps strength, less effusion, less pain, greater tibial rotation, higher Marx Activity score, higher athletic confidence, higher preoperative knee self-efficacy, lower kinesiophobia and higher preoperative self-motivation. CONCLUSIONS: Weak evidence supports an association between knee impairment, functional and psychological variables and return to sport. Current return to sport guidelines should be updated to reflect all variables associated with return to sport. Utilising evidence-based return to sport guidelines following ACLR may ensure that athletes are physically and psychologically capable of sports participation, which may reduce reinjury rates and the need for subsequent surgery.},

  abstract = {Creatine is one of the most popular athletic supplements with sales surpassing 400 million dollars in 2004. Due to the popularity and efficacy of creatine supplementation over 200 studies have examined the effects of creatine on athletic performance. Despite the abundance of research suggesting the effectiveness and safety of creatine, a fallacy appears to exist among the general public, driven by media claims and anecdotal reports, that creatine supplementation can result in muscle cramps and dehydration. Although a number of published studies have refuted these claims, a recent position statement by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) in 2000 advised individuals who are managing their weight and exercising intensely or in hot environments to avoid creatine supplementation. Recent reports now suggest that creatine may enhance performance in hot and/or humid conditions by maintaining haematocrit, aiding thermoregulation and reducing exercising heart rate and sweat rate. Creatine may also positively influence plasma volume during the onset of dehydration. Considering these new published findings, little evidence exists that creatine supplementation in the heat presents additional risk, and this should be taken into consideration as position statements and other related documents are published.},

It highlights the primary mood disorders and secondary neurologic causes of mood disorders that are commonly encountered in a clinical setting. As the literature and our understanding evolve, recent additions to the current literature are important to bring forth to the readers.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advancements in clinical medicine have strengthened our understanding of the associations of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. This article highlights the medications frequently used with newly identified mood disorders and the common side effects of these medications. A paradigm shift has moved toward newer treatment modalities, such as the use of ketamine, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and complementary and alternative medicine. The risks and benefits of such therapies, along with medications, are reviewed in this article.                                         SUMMARY               Mood disorders are extraordinarily complex disorders with significant association with many neurologic disorders. Early identification of these mood disorders can prevent significant morbidity and mortality associated with them. With further expansion of pharmacologic options, more targeted therapy is possible in improving quality of life for patients.},

Yet, few resources exist to assist physical therapists with the basic mechanics and quality standards of producing a clinical case report. This situation is further complicated by the absence of uniform standards for quality in case reporting. The importance of including a concise yet comprehensive description of patient functioning in all physical therapy case reports suggest the potential appropriateness of basing quality guidelines on the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) model. The purpose of this paper is to assist physical therapists in creating high-quality clinical case reports for the peer-reviewed literature using the ICF model as a guiding framework. Along these lines, current recommendations related to the basic mechanics of writing a successful clinical case report are reviewed, as well and a proposal for uniform clinical case reporting requirements is introduced with the aim to improve the quality and feasibility of clinical case reporting in physical therapy that are informed by the ICF model.},

Bacterial meningitis is usually lethal unless appropriate antibiotics that cross the blood-brain barrier are given. Clinical suspicion of bacterial meningitis begins when patients present with the abrupt onset of fever, headache, and meningismus.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               New technologies are being developed for more rapid identification of the bacterial species causing meningitis. When appropriate, administration of adjunctive dexamethasone with the antibiotics often lessens neurologic sequelae in survivors, which may include aphasia, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, and cognitive impairment.                                         SUMMARY               Confirmation of the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis comes mainly from examination and culture of CSF obtained from a lumbar puncture. Typically, the CSF shows an elevated neutrophil count, elevated protein, depressed glucose, positive Gram stain, and growth of the bacteria on appropriate culture media. Antibiotic sensitivities of the bacteria determine the appropriate antibiotics, although an educated guess of the best antibiotics to be given promptly must be made until the antibiotic sensitivities return, usually in a few days.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Substantial variability exists in the presenting features and clinical course of patients with common neurodegenerative causes of dementia, but the response to available therapies and eventual outcomes are often poor. This realization has influenced the evaluation of patients with dementia, with diagnostic approaches emphasizing routine screening for a short list of potentially modifiable disorders that may exacerbate dementia symptoms or severity but rarely influence long-term outcomes. Although a standard approach to the assessment of dementia is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, neurologists involved in the assessment of patients with dementia must recognize those rare patients with reversible causes of dementia, coordinate additional investigations when required, and ensure expedited access to treatments that may reverse decline and optimize long-term outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               The potential to improve the outcome of patients with reversible dementias exemplifies the need to recognize these patients in clinical practice.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft failure and contralateral ACL tears are more frequent in children and adolescents than adults. The reasons for higher subsequent injury rates in this population are incompletely understood. METHODS: We analyzed a continuous cohort of patients who were {$<$}18 years of age. Subjects underwent isolated, primary ACL reconstruction with autograft between 2006 and January 1, 2014, and had a minimum 2-year follow-up. Return-to-sport characteristics were described, and multivariable Cox regression modeling was used to identify predictors of a second ACL injury. Candidate variables included patient factors (age, sex, physeal status, tibial slope, notch width index), surgical characteristics (graft type, surgical technique), measures of recovery (time to return to sport, duration of physical therapy), and patients' preoperative and postoperative sports involvement (primary and secondary sports, number of sports). RESULTS: A total of 112 subjects met inclusion criteria; of these patients, 85 (76\%) had complete follow-up data and were analyzed. The mean age (and standard deviation) was 13.9 {\textpm} 2.1 years (range, 6 to 17 years); 77\% had open physes. The mean follow-up was 48.3 {\textpm} 15.3 months. Seventy-seven patients (91\%) returned to sports, and 84\% returned to the same sport. The mean Marx activity score at the time of the latest follow-up was 13.7 {\textpm} 3.5 points. Patients were involved in fewer sports after ACL reconstruction, 1.48 {\textpm} 0.92 compared with 1.83 {\textpm} 1.01 sports before reconstruction (p = 0.002). Sixteen patients (19\%) sustained an ACL graft rupture, 11 patients (13\%) sustained a contralateral ACL tear, and 1 of these patients (1\%) sustained both. The overall prevalence of a second ACL injury was 32\%. Time to return to sport was the only significant predictor of a second ACL injury, with a slower return being protective (hazard ratio per month, 0.87 [95\% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.99]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric athletes return to sports at a high rate (91\%) after ACL reconstruction. Unfortunately, the prevalence of a second ACL injury is high at 32\%. Within this population, an earlier return to sport is predictive of a second ACL injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation of soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is usually performed without sport-specific guidelines, and the final phases are often left to the team coaches. The possibility of changing this approach has not yet been investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. HYPOTHESIS: A specific rehabilitation protocol for soccer players, with direct control of the last on-field rehabilitation phases, may lead to complete functional recovery. METHODS: Fifty competitive soccer players who followed a sport-specific rehabilitation protocol for soccer were evaluated during the recovery period until their return to competition. The assessment of the functional outcomes was performed using the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale and isokinetic and aerobic fitness tests. RESULTS: The average start of on-field rehabilitation was 90 {\textpm} 26 days after surgery; the average time to return to the competitions was 185 {\textpm} 52 days. The improvement in the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale during on-field rehabilitation was significant (P {$<$} 0.01; from 79 {\textpm} 15\% to 96 {\textpm} 7\%). The isokinetic and aerobic fitness tests showed a significant improvement of muscle strength (knee extensors, +55\%, P {$<$} 0.01; knee flexors, +86\%, P {$<$} 0.01) and aerobic threshold (+23\%, P {$<$} 0.01) from the beginning to the end of on-field rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Adding on-field rehabilitation to the traditional protocols after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may safely lead to complete functional recovery in soccer players.},

  abstract = {Skin aging has become a recurring concern even for younger people, mainly owing to increased life expectancy. In this context, the use of nutricosmetics as supplements has increased in recent years. Moreover, numerous scientific studies have shown the benefits of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation in improving the signs of skin aging. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence on the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on human skin through a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of clinical trials focusing on the process of skin aging. A literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), and Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine databases. Eligible studies were randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials that evaluated oral supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen as an intervention and reported at least one of the following outcomes: skin wrinkles, hydration, elasticity, and firmness. After retrieving articles from the databases, 19 studies were selected, with a total of 1,125 participants aged between 20 and 70\,years (95\% women). In the meta-analysis, a grouped analysis of studies showed favorable results of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation compared with placebo in terms of skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles. The findings of improved hydration and elasticity were also confirmed in the subgroup meta-analysis. Based on results, ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen for 90\,days is effective in reducing skin aging, as it reduces wrinkles and improves skin elasticity and hydration.},

  abstract = {The hypoglossal nerve is the 12th cranial nerve, exiting the brainstem in the preolivary sulcus, passing through the premedullary cistern, and exiting the skull through the hypoglossal canal. This is a purely motor nerve, responsible for the innervation of all the intrinsic tongue muscles (superior longitudinal muscle, inferior longitudinal muscle, transverse muscle, and vertical muscle), 3 extrinsic tongue muscles (styloglossus, hyoglossus, and genioglossus), and the geniohyoid muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging exam to evaluate patients with clinical signs of hypoglossal nerve palsy, and computed tomography may have a complementary role in the evaluation of bone lesions affecting the hypoglossal canal. A heavily T2-weighted sequence, such as fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) or constructive interference steady state (CISS) is important to evaluate this nerve on MRI. There are multiple causes of hypoglossal nerve palsy, being neoplasia the most common cause, but vascular lesions, inflammatory diseases, infections, and trauma can also affect this nerve. The purpose of this article is to review the hypoglossal nerve anatomy, discuss the best imaging techniques to evaluate this nerve and demonstrate the imaging aspect of the main diseases that affect it.},

These disorders commonly occur in head trauma, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases such as idiopathic Parkinson disease and dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer disease, just to name a few. This article covers the basic anatomy of smell and taste, notes the important points of taking a proper history, and discusses smell and taste testing, which are inexpensive, minimally time-consuming procedures. Recurrent bad smells and tastes are not uncommon in these disorders, which cause major impairment in quality of life, including loss of appetite, decreased eating, and weight loss. The diagnosis and treatment of these disorders will also be discussed.                                         Recent Findings:               Despite past widespread negative prognoses of taste and smell disorders, more recent work in the last 10 years has shown an improved prognosis for smell and taste recovery in most disorders, and recommendations for changes in food preparation have helped many patients enjoy their food and increase their appetite. Recent experimental evidence has shown that smell loss and testing can assist in separating idiopathic Parkinson disease from other parkinsonian syndromes, can suggest which patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder will more likely develop Parkinson disease, and can be predictive of the progression of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer dementia.                                         Summary:               This article discusses the common smell and taste disorders that a clinical neurologist will encounter in practice. The anatomy and function of smell and taste will be reviewed, followed by office evaluation and testing. The common disorders will be reviewed, along with their prognosis and management.},

An anatomic approach is used; diseases of the extradural, intradural-extramedullary, and intramedullary (parenchymal) compartments are considered, and both neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions are covered. Differentiating imaging features are highlighted.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although T2-hyperintense signal abnormality of the spinal cord can have myriad etiologies, neuroimaging can provide specific diagnoses or considerably narrow the differential diagnosis in many cases. Intradural-extramedullary lesions compressing the spinal cord have a limited differential diagnosis and are usually benign; meningiomas and schwannomas are most common. Extradural lesions can often be specifically diagnosed. Disk herniations are the most commonly encountered mass of the epidural space. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy can cause a characteristic pattern of enhancement, which may be mistaken for an intrinsic myelopathy. A do-not-miss diagnosis of the extradural compartment is idiopathic spinal cord herniation, the appearance of which can overlap with arachnoid cysts and webs. Regarding intrinsic causes of myelopathy, the lesions of multiple sclerosis are characteristically short segment but can be confluent when multiple. Postcontrast MRI can be particularly helpful, including when attempting to differentiate the long-segment myelopathy of neurosarcoidosis and aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG--seropositive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and when characterizing spinal cord tumors such as primary neoplasms and metastases. Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula is another do-not-miss diagnosis, with characteristic MRI features both precontrast and postcontrast. Tract-specific white matter involvement can be a clue for diseases such as subacute combined degeneration, paraneoplastic myelopathy, and radiation myelitis, whereas gray matter--specific involvement can suggest conditions such as cord infarct, viral myelitis, or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG associated disorder.                                         SUMMARY               Knowledge of the neuroimaging findings of the many causes of spinal cord and cauda equina dysfunction is critical for both neurologists and neuroradiologists. A structured approach to lesion compartmental location and imaging feature characterization is recommended.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               A tie between nutritional or gastrointestinal and neurologic disease has been recognized for centuries. Many gastrointestinal disorders are associated with neurologic disease through nutritional, immune-mediated, or degenerative pathophysiologies. This article reviews neurologic disorders in patients with gastrointestinal disease and gastrointestinal manifestations in their own neurologic patients.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                Development of new gastric and bariatric surgical procedures and the widespread use of over-the-counter gastric acid--reducing medications continue to create vitamin and nutritional deficiencies despite modern diet and supplementation. Some supplements, such as vitamin A, vitamin B                 6                 , and selenium, themselves are now found to cause disease. Recent work has shown extraintestinal and neurologic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease. Chronic brain damage in liver disease has been recognized, and the opportunity to intervene may exist in the covert beginning stages. The characterization of gluten-related neurologic symptoms and differentiation from those of celiac disease is an evolving body of work.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               Gastrointestinal and neurologic diseases related to common immune-mediated, degenerative, or infectious mechanisms are common and can coexist in the same patient. Furthermore, gastrointestinal disease may cause neurologic complications because of nutritional inadequacies, malabsorption, and hepatic dysfunction. In many cases, the complications are treatable but have subtle or protean presentations. Therefore, the consulting neurologist must be current in knowledge of the growing ties between gastrointestinal and neurologic disease.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cancer therapies can cause a wide range of neurologic adverse effects and may result in significant patient morbidity and mortality. Although some treatment-associated neurologic complications manifest acutely and are often reversible and transient, others occur with delayed onset, can be progressive, and are uniquely challenging to patient management. With an increase in multimodality and combination therapies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies, and prolonged patient survival, novel and unique patterns of neurologic complications have emerged.                                         SUMMARY               Both conventional and novel cancer therapies can adversely affect the nervous system, thereby producing a wide range of neurologic complications.

Serving is the most strenuous stroke in tennis, with the highest peak muscle activity in the shoulder and forearm occurring during this stroke. The kinetic chain links upper extremity, lower extremity, and core muscle segments by transmitting coordinated activation and motion; in this regard, any pathologic process that disturbs the groin, hip, and abdominal musculature can further result in an increased risk of injury to the shoulder and upper extremity. Evolution in equipment and in play surfaces has also affected the type and frequency of injuries. Prevention programs that address the muscular imbalances throughout the kinetic chain may help reduce the incidence of both acute and chronic injuries experienced by tennis athletes.},

However, much of the human research has concentrated on chronic supplementation in cognitively compromised cohorts. OBJECTIVE: The current pilot study investigated the acute and chronic (28-day) cognitive and mood-enhancing effects of Hericium erinaceus in a healthy, young adult cohort. DESIGN: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups design investigated the acute (60 min post dose) and chronic (28-day intervention) effects of 1.8 g Hericium erinaceus in 41 healthy adults aged 18-45 years. RESULTS: Analysis revealed that following a single dose of Hericium erinaceus, participants performed quicker on the Stroop task (p = 0.005) at 60 min post dose. A trend towards reduced subjective stress was observed following 28-day supplementation (p = 0.051). CONCLUSIONS: The findings tentatively suggest that Hericium erinaceus may improve speed of performance and reduce subjective stress in healthy, young adults. However, null and limited negative findings were also observed. Given the small sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further investigation in larger sample sizes is crucial, however the findings of this trial offer a promising avenue of interest.},

  abstract = {Iron and copper have similar physiochemical properties; thus, physiologically relevant interactions seem likely. Indeed, points of intersection between these two essential trace minerals have been recognized for many decades, but mechanistic details have been lacking. Investigations in recent years have revealed that copper may positively influence iron homeostasis, and also that iron may antagonize copper metabolism. For example, when body iron stores are low, copper is apparently redistributed to tissues important for regulating iron balance, including enterocytes of upper small bowel, the liver, and blood. Copper in enterocytes may positively influence iron transport, and hepatic copper may enhance biosynthesis of a circulating ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin, which potentiates iron release from stores. Moreover, many intestinal genes related to iron absorption are transactivated by a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-2{$\alpha$} (HIF2{$\alpha$}), during iron deficiency. Interestingly, copper influences the DNA-binding activity of the HIF factors, thus further exemplifying how copper may modulate intestinal iron homeostasis. Copper may also alter the activity of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Furthermore, copper depletion has been noted in iron-loading disorders, such as hereditary hemochromatosis. Copper depletion may also be caused by high-dose iron supplementation, raising concerns particularly in pregnancy when iron supplementation is widely recommended. This review will cover the basic physiology of intestinal iron and copper absorption as well as the metabolism of these minerals in the liver. Also considered in detail will be current experimental work in this field, with a focus on molecular aspects of intestinal and hepatic iron-copper interplay and how this relates to various disease states. {\copyright} 2018 American Physiological Society.

  abstract = {BACKGOUND: Balance and proprioceptive deficits are frequently persistent after total joint replacement, limiting functionality and involving altered movement patterns and difficulties in walking and maintaining postural control among patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the short- and mid-term effects of proprioceptive and balance training for patients undergoing total knee and hip replacement. METHODS: This is a systematic review of literature. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PEDro, and Scopus were the databases searched. The review included randomized clinical trials in which the experimental groups underwent a training aimed at improving balance and proprioception, in addition to conventional care. The studies had to assess at least one of the following outcomes: self-reported functionality or balance (primary outcomes), knee function, pain, falls, or quality of life. RESULTS: Eight trials were included, involving 567 participants. The quantitative synthesis found a moderate to high significant effect of balance and proprioceptive trainings on self-reported functionality and balance after total knee replacement. The effects were maintained at mid-term in terms of balance alone. Conversely, preoperative training did not enhance outcomes after total hip arthroplasty. SIGNIFICANCE: The synthesis showed that, in clinical terms, balance trainings are a convenient complement to conventional physiotherapy care to produce an impact on balance and functionality after knee replacement. If outcomes such as improvement in pain, knee range of movement, or patient quality of life are to be promoted, it would be advisable to explore alternative proposals specifically targeting these goals. Further research is needed to confirm or discard the current evidence ultimately, predominantly in terms of the effects on the hips and those yielded by preoperative interventions.},

Recent Findings:               GBS is an acute/subacute-onset polyradiculoneuropathy typically presenting with sensory symptoms and weakness over several days, often leading to quadriparesis. Approximately 70\% of patients report a recent preceding upper or lower respiratory tract infection or gastrointestinal illness. Approximately 30\% of patients require intubation and ventilation because of respiratory failure. Nerve conduction studies in the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) form of GBS typically show evidence for a multifocal demyelinating process, including conduction block or temporal dispersion in motor nerves. Sural sparing is a common phenomenon when testing sensory nerves. CSF analysis commonly shows an elevated protein, but this elevation may not be present until the third week of the illness. Patients with AIDP are treated with best medical management and either IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange.                                         Summary:               GBS is a common form of acute quadriparesis; a high level of suspicion is needed for early diagnosis. With appropriate therapy, most patients make a very good to complete recovery.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Muscle symptoms are common among statin users and are usually reversible after discontinuation of the statin; rarely, however, statins trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy that persists and requires immunomodulatory therapy. Autoantibodies targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase can distinguish the toxic and immune-mediated forms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, increasingly used in the treatment of advanced cancer, have recently been associated with the development of inflammatory myositis. A reversible mitochondrial myopathy has long been associated with zidovudine, but recent reports elucidate the risk of myopathy with newer antivirals, such as telbivudine and raltegravir.                                         SUMMARY               The medications most commonly associated with myopathy include statins, amiodarone, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, certain antivirals, and corticosteroids, and myopathy can occur with chronic alcoholism. Certain clinical, electrodiagnostic, and histologic features can aid in early recognition. Stopping the use of the offending agent reverses symptoms in most cases, but specific and timely treatment may be required in cases related to agents that trigger immune-mediated muscle injury.},

A secondary objective of this study is to further compare the physical capacities and abilities that may differentiate between the competitive levels of surfing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: Twelve junior-elite (currently competing at a state level or higher and 12-18 years of age), twelve senior-elite (currently competing at a national level and/or the World Qualifying Series and over 16 years of age), and twelve recreational surfers (minimum of two years surfing experience; actively surfing at least once a week and over 18 years of age) were recruited for this study. All participants completed a pre-exercise medical questionnaire, anthropometric assessment, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion assessment, medial-lateral ankle proprioception assessment, countermovement jump, squat jump, isometric mid-thigh pull and drop-and-stick. RESULTS: Senior-elite surfers had large and significantly better ankle proprioception and range of motion than junior-elite and recreational surfers. However, the relationship between years of surf-specific experience and ankle proprioception was small and non-significant. Better drop-and-stick performance, indicated by lower relative peak force, was present in the senior-elite compared to the junior-elite and recreational groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that medial-lateral ankle proprioception is a distinguishing characteristic of senior-elite surfers and therefore, may be a critical ability for competitive success. Greater ankle range of motion and the ability to attenuate energy to reduce landing force may be developed through long-term training commensurate with competitive surfing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cost-benefit analyses have been proposed for determining acceptable risk of injury regarding training and competition participation. Currently, there is no best evidence synthesis of the literature evaluating the relationship between injury/illness and chance of success or failure. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between injury and/or illness and success and/or failure in athletic populations (individual and team sports). METHODS: This review was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42016036729) and a systematic electronic search was conducted in May 2016. Inclusion criterion was any study design describing the association between injury and/or illness and success or failure in athletic performance. Two independent authors screened search results, performed data extraction and assessed methodological quality and strength of evidence using a modified Downs and Black appraisal tool and a modified van Tulder method, respectively. RESULTS: Of 10\,546 titles identified, 14 satisfied the inclusion criteria and 7 had low risk of bias. Outcome measures associated with success and/or failure included: (1) availability of team members, (2) injury incidence, (3) injury burden, (4) squad utilisation and (5, 6) precompetition and in-competition injury. There was strong evidence that (1) increased availability of team members/athletes decreased the risk of failure and (2) precompetition and in-competition injuries were associated with increased risk of failure. CONCLUSIONS: Injuries have a detrimental impact on team and individual athletic success. Increased player availability improves chances of success. Conversely, injuries sustained both prior to and during competition may increase risk of failure. Injury prevention should therefore be a priority for maximising athletic performance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aims of this systematic review were to identify the different versions of the Tampa Scale of kinesiophobia (TSK) and to report on the psychometric evidence relating to these different versions for people experiencing musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Medline [Ovid] CINAHL and Embase databases were searched for publications reporting on the psychometric properties of the TSK in populations with musculoskeletal pain. Risks of bias were evaluated using the COSMIN risk of the bias assessment tool. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included, mainly with a low risk of bias. Five versions of the TSK were identified: TSK-17, TSK-13, TSK-11, TSK-4, and TSK-TMD (for temporomandibular disorders). Most TSK versions showed good to excellent test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient correlation 0.77 to 0.99) and good internal consistency (ɑ=0.68 to 0.91), except for the TSK-4 as its reliability has yet to be defined. The minimal detectable change was lower for the TSK-17 (11\% to 13\% of total score) and the TSK-13 (8\% of total score) compared with the TSK-11 (16\% of total score). Most TSK versions showed good construct validity, although TSK-11 validity was inconsistent between studies. Finally, the TSK-17, -13, and -11 were highly responsive to change, while responsiveness has yet to be defined for the TSK-4 and TSK-TMD. DISCUSSION: Clinical guidelines now recommend that clinicians identify the presence of kinesiophobia among patients as it may contribute to persistent pain and disability. The TSK is a self-report questionnaire widely used, but 5 different versions exist. Based on these results, the use of TSK-13 and TSK-17 is encouraged as they are valid, reliable, and responsive.},

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline search was performed via PubMed (through June 2010) using the search terms cuboid, syndrome, subluxed, locked, fault, dropped, peroneal, lateral, plantar, and neuritis with the Boolean term AND in all possible combinations. Retrieved articles were hand searched for additional relevant references. RESULTS: Cuboid syndrome is thought to arise from subtle disruption of the arthrokinematics or structural congruity of the calcaneocuboid joint, although the precise pathomechanic mechanism has not been elucidated. Fibroadipose synovial folds (or labra) within the calcaneocuboid joint may play a role in the cause of cuboid syndrome, but this is highly speculative. The symptoms of cuboid syndrome resemble those of a ligament sprain. Currently, there are no definitive diagnostic tests for this condition. Case reports suggest that cuboid syndrome often responds favorably to manipulation and/or external support. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines regarding cuboid syndrome are lacking. Consequently, the diagnosis of cuboid syndrome is often based on a constellation of signs and symptoms and a high index of suspicion. Unless contraindicated, manipulation of the cuboid should be considered as an initial treatment.},

In recent years, there have been renewed attempts in extending the Wilcoxon rank sum test for clustered data, one of which (Datta and Satten, 2005, Journal of the American Statistical Association 100, 908-915) addresses the issue of informative cluster size, i.e., when the outcomes and the cluster size are correlated. We are faced with a situation where the group specific marginal distribution in a cluster depends on the number of observations in that group (i.e., the intra-cluster group size). We develop a novel extension of the rank-sum test for handling this situation. We compare the performance of our test with the Datta-Satten test, as well as the naive Wilcoxon rank sum test. Using a naturally occurring simulation model of informative intra-cluster group size, we show that only our test maintains the correct size. We also compare our test with a classical signed rank test based on averages of the outcome values in each group paired by the cluster membership. While this test maintains the size, it has lower power than our test. Extensions to multiple group comparisons and the case of clusters not having samples from all groups are also discussed. We apply our test to determine whether there are differences in the attachment loss between the upper and lower teeth and between mesial and buccal sites of periodontal patients.},

  abstract = {A herniated disc in the spine is a condition during which a nucleus pulposus is displaced from intervertebral space. It is a common cause of back pain. The patients who experience pain related to a herniated disc often remember an inciting event that caused their pain. Unlike mechanical back pain, herniated disc pain is often burning or stinging, and may radiate into the lower extremity. Furthermore, in more severe cases, there can be associated with weakness or sensation changes. In the spine, a disc or a nucleus pulposus is localized between vertebral bodies.~It supports the spine by acting as a shock-absorbing cushion.~In some instances, a herniated disc injury can compress the nerve or the spinal cord that causes pain consistent with nerve compression or spinal cord dysfunction, also known as myelopathy. Herniated discs can be very painful. Unfortunately, there are limited effective conservative treatment modalities with significant effectiveness. Within a few weeks, most cases of painful disc herniation heal. In many instances, the herniation of the disc does not cause that patient any pain. Herniated discs are often seen on MRIs of asymptomatic patients. Imaging is not indicated in a patient with signs and symptoms of a stable herniated disc until six weeks of persistent symptoms. MRI is the imaging modality of choice. Most cases of herniated disc heal conservatively, but refractory cases may require interventional procedures or surgical repair. Epidural corticosteroid injections are effective pain relievers for disc herniation in the short term, while discectomy is more effective than conservative management until one year following surgery~. Providers need to remain aware of treating the patient with a herniated disc and monitor for severe or rapidly progressing neurological changes; this would be an indication for urgent neurosurgical referral.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience deficits in motor and cognitive domains, resulting in impairment in dual-task walking ability. The goal of this study was to compare performance of forward walking and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions in persons with MS to age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We also examined relationships between forward and backward walking to cognitive function, balance, and retrospective fall reports. METHODS: All measures were collected in a single session. A 2 {\texttimes} 2 {\texttimes} 2 mixed model ANOVA was used to compare differences in forward and backward walking in single- and dual-task conditions between MS and healthy controls. Spearman correlations were used to examine relationships between gait and cognitive function, falls, and balance. RESULTS: Eighteen individuals with relapsing-remitting MS and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls participated. Backward walking velocity revealed significant differences between groups for both single-task (p = 0.015) and dual-task (p = 0.014) conditions. Persons with MS demonstrated significant differences between single- and dual-task forward and backward walking velocities (p = 0.023; p = 0.004), whereas this difference was only apparent in the backward walking condition for healthy controls (p = 0.004). In persons with MS, there were significant differences in double support time between single- and dual-task conditions in both backward (p {$<$} 0.001) and forward (p = 0.001) directions. More falls at six months were significantly associated with shorter backward dual-task stride length (r = -0.490; p = 0.046) and slower velocity (r = -0.483; p = 0.050). CONCLUSION: Differences in MS and age- and sex-matched healthy controls are more pronounced during backward compared to forward walking under single- and dual-task conditions. Future work with a larger sample size is needed to validate the clinical utility of backward walking and dual-task assessments and mitigate the limited sensitivity of the current dual-task assessments that primarily rely upon forward walking.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with multiple sclerosis experience deficits in mobility resulting in injurious falls. Fall detection has proved challenging; the majority of clinical measures rely on forward walking and balance measures, yet these measures have poor sensitivity and predictive value for differentiating between fallers and non-fallers. Backward walking better differentiates fallers from non-fallers in the elderly and other neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, the objective of this study was to examine both forward and backward walking to determine the strongest, unique contributor that differentiates fallers from non-fallers in persons with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: In a single session, spatiotemporal measures of forward and backward walking and fall history were collected. For the subsequent six months, individuals recorded falls in a fall diary. Discriminant function analysis was used to determine what variables most strongly and uniquely differentiate multiple sclerosis fallers from non-fallers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight individuals with multiple sclerosis participated. Forward and backward velocity, stride length, and double support time as well as age, disease severity, and symptom duration were included in the models. Together, the variables differentiated between fallers and non-fallers (Wilk's lambda {$\chi$}2 (8, N~=~36)~=~0.497, p{$<$}0.001) and in rank order, backward walking velocity was the strongest unique predictor. Repeating the analysis with a stepwise approach yielded that backward walking velocity in the first step ({$\chi$}2 (1, 34)~=~0.68, F~=~15.96, p{$<$}0.001) and symptom duration in the second step ({$\chi$}2~=~0.59, F (2, 33)~=~11.46; p{$<$}0.001) most strongly differentiated retrospective fallers and non-fallers. This stepwise model with backward walking velocity and symptom duration accurately classified 76.3\% of cases. Addition of forward walking measures did not significantly improve the models, and indeed the accuracy of classification was reduced to 71.1\%. Exploratory analysis showed that backward walking velocity was the best predictor of prospectively reported fallers and non-fallers ({$\chi$}2 (1, 7)~=~0.43, F~=~9.20, p~=~0.02). CONCLUSION: Backward walking velocity exhibits the highest effect magnitude and specificity in differentiating fallers from non-fallers in individuals with MS and demonstrates potential as clinically feasible and efficient fall detection tool.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Conditions causing recurrent spontaneous episodes of dizziness or vertigo span several medical specialties, making it challenging for clinicians to gain confidence in evaluating and managing the spectrum of episodic vestibular disorders. Patients are often asymptomatic and have normal examinations at the time of evaluation. Thus, diagnosis depends heavily on eliciting key features from the history. Overreliance on symptom quality descriptions commonly leads to misdiagnosis. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to the diagnosis and management of conditions that cause episodic spontaneous dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Consensus diagnostic criteria have been established for vestibular migraine, M{\'e}ni{\`e}re disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo. Vertigo has been recognized as a common symptom in vertebrobasilar ischemia, cardiogenic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Treatment recommendations for vestibular migraine still lack high-quality evidence, but controlled trials are occurring. SUMMARY: The evaluation should start with a detailed description of the episodes from the patient and any observers. Rather than focusing first on whether the symptom quality is most consistent with vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness, the clinician should clarify the timing (episode frequency and duration), possible triggers or circumstances (eg, position changes, upright posture), and accompanying symptoms. History should identify any auditory symptoms, migraine features, posterior circulation ischemic symptoms, vascular risk factors, clues for anxiety, and potentially relevant medications. Carefully selected testing can help secure the diagnosis, but excessive and indiscriminate testing can lead to more confusion. Treatments for these conditions are vastly different, so an accurate diagnosis is critical.},

Comprehension, expression, social communication, problem solving, and memory skills were significant in favor of the control group (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Graphestesia and self-care domain was found to be correlated (r\,=\,0,491, p\,=\,0.002) between the groups. DISCUSSION: Special education and rehabilitation programs including sensory integration therapy and motor performance will increase independence in the activities of daily living in children with developmental coordination disorder.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationship between infection and stroke has taken on new urgency in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This association is not a new concept, as several infections have long been recognized to contribute to stroke risk. The association of infection and stroke is also bidirectional. Although infection can lead to stroke, stroke also induces immune suppression which increases risk of infection. Apart from their short-term effects, emerging evidence suggests that poststroke immune changes may also adversely affect long-term cognitive outcomes in patients with stroke, increasing the risk of poststroke neurodegeneration and dementia. Infections at the time of stroke may also increase immune dysregulation after the stroke, further exacerbating the risk of cognitive decline. This review will cover the role of acute infections, including respiratory infections such as COVID-19, as a trigger for stroke; the role of infectious burden, or the cumulative number of infections throughout life, as a contributor to long-term risk of atherosclerotic disease and stroke; immune dysregulation after stroke and its effect on the risk of stroke-associated infection; and the impact of infection at the time of a stroke on the immune reaction to brain injury and subsequent long-term cognitive and functional outcomes. Finally, we will present a model to conceptualize the many relationships among chronic and acute infections and their short- and long-term neurological consequences. This model will suggest several directions for future research.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE               The goal of this article is to increase clinicians' understanding of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and improve skills in assessing risk for and diagnosing PTSD. The importance and sequelae of lifetime trauma burden are discussed, with reference to trends in prevention, early intervention, and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD has different clinical phenotypes, which are reflected in the changes in                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) criteria. PTSD is almost always complicated by comorbidity. Treatment requires a multimodal approach, usually including medication, different therapeutic techniques, and management of comorbidity. Interest is growing in the neurobiology of childhood survivors of trauma, intergenerational transmission of trauma, and long-term impact of trauma on physical health. Mitigation of the risk of PTSD pretrauma in the military and first responders is gaining momentum, given concerns about the cost and disability associated with PTSD. Interest is also growing in screening for PTSD in medical populations, with evidence of improved clinical outcomes. Preliminary research supports the treatment of PTSD with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.                                                        SUMMARY               PTSD is a trauma-related disorder with features of fear and negative thinking about the trauma and the future. Untreated, it leads to ongoing disruption of life due to avoidance, impaired vocational and social functioning, and other symptoms, depending on the phenotype. Despite a theoretical understanding of underlying mechanisms, PTSD remains challenging to treat, although evidence exists for benefit of pharmacologic agents and trauma-focused therapies. A need still remains for treatments that are more effective and efficient, with faster onset.},

  abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence documenting loads applied to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) for weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing exercises. ACL loading has been quantified by inverse dynamics techniques that measure anterior shear force at the tibiofemoral joint (net force primarily restrained by the ACL), ACL strain (defined as change in ACL length with respect to original length and expressed as a percentage) measured directly in vivo, and ACL tensile force estimated through mathematical modeling and computer optimization techniques. A review of the biomechanical literature indicates the following: ACL loading is generally greater with non-weight-bearing compared to weight-bearing exercises; with both types of exercises, the ACL is loaded to a greater extent between 10{$^\circ$} to 50{$^\circ$} of knee flexion (generally peaking between 10{$^\circ$} and 30{$^\circ$}) compared to 50{$^\circ$} to 100{$^\circ$} of knee flexion; and loads on the ACL change according to exercise technique (such as trunk position). Squatting with excessive forward movement of the knees beyond the toes and with the heels off the ground tends to increase ACL loading. Squatting and lunging with a forward trunk tilt tend to decrease ACL loading, likely due to increased hamstrings activity. During seated knee extension, ACL force decreases when the resistance pad is positioned more proximal on the anterior aspect of the lower leg, away from the ankle. The evidence reviewed as part of this manuscript provides objective data by which to rank exercises based on loading applied to the ACL. The biggest challenge in exercise selection post-ACL reconstruction is the limited knowledge of the optimal amount of stress that should be applied to the ACL graft as it goes through its initial incorporation and eventual maturation process. Clinicians may utilize this review as a guide to exercise selection and rehabilitation progression for patients post-ACL reconstruction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing number of diagnostic tests and biomarkers have been validated during the last decades, and this will still be a prominent field of research in the future because of the need for personalized medicine. Strict evaluation is needed whenever we aim at validating any potential diagnostic tool, and the first requirement a new testing procedure must fulfill is diagnostic accuracy. SUMMARY: Diagnostic accuracy measures tell us about the ability of a test to discriminate between and/or predict disease and health. This discriminative and predictive potential can be quantified by measures of diagnostic accuracy such as sensitivity and specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, overall accuracy and diagnostic odds ratio. Some measures are useful for discriminative purposes, while others serve as a predictive tool. Measures of diagnostic accuracy vary in the way they depend on the prevalence, spectrum and definition of the disease. In general, measures of diagnostic accuracy are extremely sensitive to the design of the study. Studies not meeting strict methodological standards usually over- or underestimate the indicators of test performance and limit the applicability of the results of the study. KEY MESSAGES: The testing procedure should be verified on a reasonable population, including people with mild and severe disease, thus providing a comparable spectrum. Sensitivities and specificities are not predictive measures. Predictive values depend on disease prevalence, and their conclusions can be transposed to other settings only for studies which are based on a suitable population (e.g. screening studies). Likelihood ratios should be an optimal choice for reporting diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic accuracy measures must be reported with their confidence intervals. We always have to report paired measures (sensitivity and specificity, predictive values or likelihood ratios) for clinically meaningful thresholds. How much discriminative or predictive power we need depends on the clinical diagnostic pathway and on misclassification (false positives/negatives) costs.},

A secondary aim was to identify patient characteristics and functioning that predicted changes in the PSFS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort study, 59 patients with ABI were assessed for the ability to complete the PSFS. A trained multidisciplinary team applied the PSFS as part of a collaborative development of rehabilitation goals. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC), the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment (NBAA) and the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment (LOTCA) were used to identify characteristics of the sample. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between changes in the PSFS score from admission to discharge and a selected set of participant baseline characteristics and functioning. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (92\%) of the patients with ABI were able to complete the PSFS. The five (8\%) who were unable to complete the PSFS had severe cognitive or language impairment. The PSFS score improved by a mean of 2.6 (SD 2.0) points from admission to discharge. The LOTCA score made the strongest unique contribution to explain the change in the PSFS score (beta = 0.477, p= 0.020). CONCLUSION: In the present study, most patients with ABI (92\%) were able to complete the PSFS. Cognitive function on admission was a predictor of improved functioning on the PSFS.},

METHODS: A prospective observational study was designed according to the checklist from Consensus-Based Standards for Selecting Health Measurement Instruments. Seventy-one patients diagnosed with stroke were recruited in the subacute phase from a rehabilitation unit in Norway. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health was used to assess the content validity. Assessment of construct validity was based on hypotheses for correlation of the PSFS and comparator measurements. We assessed reliability by calculating the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (3.1) and the standard error of measurement. The assessment of responsiveness was based on hypotheses for the correlation of change scores between the PSFS and the comparator measurements. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to assess responsiveness. The smallest detectable change and minimal important change were calculated. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the PSFS items were classified as activities and participation in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, indicating satisfactory content validity. The reliability was satisfactory with an ICC of 0.81 (95\% CI\,=\,0.69-0.89). The standard error of measurement was 0.70 point, and the smallest detectable change was 1.94 points. Five of 7 hypotheses were confirmed for construct validity, and 5 of 6 were confirmed for responsiveness, indicating moderate construct validity and high responsiveness. Assessing responsiveness with a criterion approach resulted in an area under the curve of 0.74. A ceiling effect was identified for 25\% of the participants 3~months after discharge. The minimal important change was estimated to be 1.58 points. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates satisfactory measurement properties for the PSFS in individuals undergoing inpatient stroke rehabilitation. IMPACT: This study supports the use of the PSFS to document and monitor patient-identified rehabilitation goals in patients receiving subacute stroke rehabilitation when applied using a shared decision approach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The contribution of rib fractures to prolonged pain and disability may be underappreciated and undertreated. Clinicians are traditionally taught that the pain and disability of rib fractures resolves in 6 to 8 weeks. METHODS: This study was a prospective observation of 203 patients with rib fractures at a level 1 trauma center. Chest wall pain was evaluated by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) pain rating index (PRI) and present pain intensity (PPI). Prolonged pain was defined as a PRI of 8 or more at 2 months after injury. Prolonged disability was defined as a decrease in 1 or more levels of work or functional status at 2 months after injury. Predictors of prolonged pain and disability were determined by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: One hundred forty-five male patients and 58 female patients with a mean injury severity score (ISS) of 20 (range, 1 to 59) had a mean of 5.4 rib fractures (range, 1 to 29). Forty-four (22\%) patients had bilateral fractures, 15 (7\%) had flail chest, and 92 (45\%) had associated injury. One hundred eighty-seven patients were followed 2 months or more. One hundred ten (59\%) patients had prolonged chest wall pain and 142 (76\%) had prolonged disability. Among 111 patients with isolated rib fractures, 67 (64\%) had prolonged chest wall pain and 69 (66\%) had prolonged disability. MPQ PPI was predictive of prolonged pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 2.5), and prolonged disability (OR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.5 to 3.4). The presence of significant associated injuries was predictive of prolonged disability (OR, 5.9; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 29). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged chest wall pain is common, and the contribution of rib fractures to disability is greater than traditionally expected. Further investigation into more effective therapies that prevent prolonged pain and disability after rib fractures is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the predictive value of return to sport (RTS) test batteries applied after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is limited. Adding assessment of psychological readiness has been recommended, but knowledge of how this affects the predictive ability of test batteries is lacking. PURPOSE: To examine the predictive ability of a RTS test battery on return to preinjury level of sport and reinjury when evaluation of psychological readiness was incorporated. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 129 patients were recruited 9 months after ACLR. Inclusion criteria were age {$\geq$}16\,years and engagement in sports before injury. Patients with concomitant ligamentous surgery or ACL revision surgery were excluded. Baseline testing included single-leg hop tests, isokinetic strength tests, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form 2000, a custom-made RTS questionnaire, and the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. The RTS criteria were IKDC 2000 score {$\geq$}85\% and {$\geq$}85\% leg symmetry index on hop and strength test. At a 2-year follow-up evaluation, further knee surgery and reinjuries were registered and the RTS questionnaire was completed again. Regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to study the predictive ability of the test battery. RESULTS: Out of the 103 patients who completed the 2-year follow-up, 42\% returned to their preinjury level of sport. ACL-RSI 9 months after surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.03) and age (OR, 1.05) predicted RTS. An ACL-RSI score {$<$}47 indicated that a patient was at risk of not returning to sport (area under the curve 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.58-0.79), with 85\% sensitivity and 45\% specificity. The functional tests did not predict RTS. Six patients sustained ACL reinjuries and 7 underwent surgery for other knee complaints/injuries after RTS testing. None of the 29 patients who passed all RTS criteria, and were therefore cleared for RTS, sustained a second knee injury. CONCLUSION: ACL-RSI and age were predictors of 2-year RTS, while functional tests were not informative. Another main finding was that none of the patients who passed the 85\% RTS criteria sustained another knee injury.},

DESIGN: Quantitative Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: 14 powerlifters, 10 Olympic weightlifters and six physical therapists. SETTING: The lifters were recorded simultaneously by video and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) system while performing squats and deadlifts. The physical therapists assessed the videos and rated whether specific lumbo-pelvic movements were visible during the lifts and whether the movement amplitude was considered injurious. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The nominal visual assessments, if there was a movement and if it was considered injurious, were compared to the degrees of movement attained from the IMU system. RESULTS: During the squat, a posterior pelvic tilt of {$\geq$}34{$^\circ$} was required to visually detect the movement. For other lumbo-pelvic movements, there was no significant difference in the amount of movement between those who were assessed as moving or not moving their lumbo-pelvic area, nor was there a difference in movement amplitude between those who were assessed as having an increased risk of injury or not. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapists did not consistently detect lumbo-pelvic movements during squats and deadlifts when performed by competitive lifters.},

It is often described as an overuse injury that can present with either unilateral or bilateral heel pain. Even though the exact mechanism of injury is unknown, it is often thought it involves repetitive stress and pressure on the calcaneal growth plate. Diagnosing Sever's disease mainly relies on a thorough clinical investigation and physical examination, with a positive squeeze test usually sufficient to establish diagnosis. Nevertheless, radiographic imaging can help exclude other differential diagnoses. Therapeutic options of Sever's disease are mostly conservative, and these include rest, physical therapy, kinesiotherapy, and orthoses. Educating parents and coaches on the symptomatology and presentation of Sever's disease is pivotal for the establishment of efficient preventive interventions and earlier diagnoses. This study presents a case of a pediatric patient with Sever's disease and offers medical insight into the diagnostic, clinical, pathologic, and therapeutic characteristics of this condition, in light of the current existing literature.},

Relationship between the type of surfing practiced and the onset of pain is not fully understood as well as the potential role of rehabilitation in preventing it. OBJECTIVE: To investigate musculoskeletal pain and to deepen whether the age and the anatomical region involved influenced the pain appearance in relation to four surfing disciplines. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out. An online survey was addressed to a group of Italian surfers (practicing surf, kitesurf, windsurf and stand up paddle since at least 1 year), collecting demographic data, discipline practiced, location of musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six surfers were involved in the study. Spine and upper limbs pain was more frequent compared to lower limbs one in the surf (p{$<$} 0.001) and in the windsurf groups (p= 0.007). In the kitesurf group a greater prevalence of pain was observed in spine and lower limbs compared to upper limbs (p= 0.017). Low back pain is the most represented among the spine pain subgroups (p{$<$} 0.001). Pain was lower in younger athletes (p= 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding risk factors and biomechanics of musculoskeletal pain is essential to realize prevention training strategies. Rehabilitation in sinergy with specific training allows pain-free activity, optimizing its overall health benefits.},

J Strength Cond Res 30(9): 2446-2452, 2016-The purpose of our study was to examine the effects of sprint interval training (SIT; 10 seconds) and high-intensity interval training (HIT; 30 seconds) on surfing athletes paddling performance (400-m time trial and repeat-sprint paddle performance). Twenty-four competitive adolescent surfers (19 male, 5 female; age = 14.4 {\textpm} 1.3 years, mass: 50.1 {\textpm} 10.7 kg, and stature: 159.9 {\textpm} 10.3 cm) were assigned to perform either 5 weeks of SIT and HIT. Participants completed a repeated-sprint paddle ability test (RSPT, 15-m surfboard sprint paddle initiated every 40 seconds {\texttimes} 10 bouts) and 400-m endurance surfboard paddle time trial before and after training. High-intensity interval training decreased the total time to complete the 400 m by 15.8 {\textpm} 16.1 seconds (p = 0.03), and SIT decreased the total time to complete the RSPT by 6.5 {\textpm} 4.3 seconds (p = 0.02). Fatigue index during the RSPT (first-slowest effort) was lower after HIT and SIT (p {$\leq$} 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences in performance changes in the 400 m (total time) and RSPT (total time, fastest 15 m time, and peak velocity) between HIT and SIT. Our study indicates that HIT and SIT may be implemented to the training program of surfers to improve aerobic and repeat-sprint paddle ability, both of which are identified as key aspects of the sport. In addition, these findings indicate that 400-m paddle and RSPT can discriminate between aerobic and anaerobic training adaptations, with aerobic gains likely from HIT and anaerobic gains from SIT.},

J Strength Cond Res 31(1): 260-271, 2017-Despite the increased professionalism and substantial growth of surfing worldwide, there is limited information available to practitioners and coaches in terms of key performance analytics that are common in other field-based sports. Indeed, research analyzing surfing performance is limited to a few studies examining male surfers' heart rates, surfing activities through time-motion analysis (TMA) using video recordings and Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) data during competition and recreational surfing. These studies have indicated that specific activities undertaken during surfing are unique with a variety of activities (i.e., paddling, resting, wave riding, breath holding, and recovery of surfboard in the surf). Furthermore, environmental and wave conditions also seem to influence the physical demands of competition surfing. It is due to these demands that surfers are required to have a high cardiorespiratory fitness, high muscular endurance, and considerable strength and anaerobic power, particular within the upper torso. By exploring various methods of performance analysis used within other sports, it is possible to improve our understanding of surfing demands. In so doing this will assist in the development of protocols and strategies to assess physiological characteristics of surfers, monitor athlete performance, improve training prescription, and identify talent. Therefore, this review explores the current literature to provide insights into methodological protocols, delimitations of research into athlete analysis and an overview of surfing dynamics. Specifically, this review will describe and review the use of TMA, GPS, and other technologies (i.e., HR) that are used in external and internal load monitoring as they pertain to surfing.},

J Strength Cond Res 32(10): 2939-2948, 2018-The study provides an in-depth descriptive and quantitative time-motion analysis of competitive surfing, using Global Positioning System (GPS) units and video synchronization, which serves to extend upon the results of Farley, Harris, and Kilding (Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 26, 7 [2012]). In addition, comparisons between locations and surfers competing in the same heats were performed. Global Positioning System and video data were collected from 41 male competitive surfers (23.2 {\textpm} 6.1 years, 71 {\textpm} 10.3 kg, 177.2 {\textpm} 6.4 cm) participating in 3 professional domestic surfing events, with competitive heats of 20-minute duration. Fifty data sets were analyzed across the 3 competitions, with velocities and distances covered, proportion of time spent performing various surfing activities, and total work-to-relief ratio determined. Results revealed surfers paddled 44\% of the total time, followed by stationary periods (42\%). Surfers performed at a significantly (p {$\leq$} 0.05) higher work-to-relief ratio (1.7:1) at the beach-break (an exposed beach) compared with point-break 1 and 2 (waves breaking around a rocky point). Point-breaks 1 and 2 had longer continuous durations of paddling, with significantly longer rides at point-break 1 over the beach-break (p {$\leq$} 0.01) and point-break 2 (p {$\leq$} 0.01). The average maximal speed (24.8 km{$\cdot$}h) from point-break 2 was significantly faster than point-break 1 (p {$\leq$} 0.01) and beach-break (p {$\leq$} 0.05). This information should influence surfing drills and conditioning methods to prepare these athletes for the disparate demands, such as training for a point-break competition involving longer durations of continuous paddling and short, high-intensity workloads for a beach-break.},

This review article aims to provide a clear explanation of the common concepts in shoulder instability and how they relate to the assessment and management of patients. There are sections covering the mechanisms of shoulder stability, the clinical assessment of patients and imaging techniques. Beyond that there is a discussion on the common classifications systems used and the typical management options. Some patients fall into reasonably well defined categories of classification and in these cases, the management plan is relatively easy to define. Unfortunately, other patients can elude simple classification and in these instances their management requires very careful consideration. Further research may help to facilitate a better understanding of management of the patients in this latter group.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Two important changes have been made to the recent                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 (                 DSM-5                 ) diagnostic criteria: the criteria that conversion symptoms must be shown to be involuntary and occurring as the consequence of a recent stressor have been dropped. Outcome studies show that the rate of misdiagnosis has declined precipitously since the 1970s and is now around 4\%. Functional neuroimaging has revealed a fairly consistent pattern of hypoactivation in brain regions linked to the specific conversion symptom, accompanied by ancillary activations in limbic, paralimbic, and basal ganglia structures. Cognitive-behavioral therapy looks promising as the psychological treatment of choice, although more definitive data are still awaited, while preliminary evidence indicates that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could prove beneficial as well.                                                        SUMMARY               Symptoms of conversion are common in neurologic and psychiatric settings, affecting up to 20\% of patients. The full syndrome of conversion disorder, while less prevalent, is associated with a guarded prognosis and a troubled psychosocial outcome. Much remains uncertain with respect to etiology, although advances in neuroscience and technology are providing reproducible findings and new insights. Given the confidence with which the diagnosis can be made, treatment should not be delayed, as symptom longevity can influence outcome.},

Comparison of anthropometry and lower limb power qualities according to different levels and ranking position of competitive surfers. J Strength Cond Res 31(8): 2231-2237, 2017-The aim of this study was to compare competitive surfers' lower limb power output depending on their competitive level, and to evaluate the association between competition rankings. Twenty competitive surfers were divided according to the competitive level as follows: international (INT) or national (NAT), and competitive ranking (RANK1-50 or RANK51-100). Vertical jump and maximal peak power of the lower limbs were measured. No differences were found between INT and NAT surfers in the anthropometric variables, in the vertical jump, or in lower extremity power; although the NAT group had higher levels on the elasticity index, squat jumps (SJs), and counter movement jumps (CMJs) compared with the INT group. The RANK1-50 group had a lower biceps skinfold (p {$<$} 0.01), lower skinfolds in the legs (Front thigh: p {$\leq$} 0.05; medial calf: p {$<$} 0.01), lower sum of skinfolds (p {$\leq$} 0.05), higher SJ (p {$<$} 0.01), CMJ (p {$<$} 0.01), and 15 seconds vertical CMJ (p {$\leq$} 0.05); also, maximal peak power of the right leg (MPPR) and left leg (MPPL) were higher in the RANK1-50 group. Moderate to large significant correlations were obtained between the surfers' ranking position and some skinfolds, the sum of skinfolds, and vertical jump. Results demonstrate that surfers' physical performance seems to be an accurate indicator of ranking positioning, also revealing that vertical jump capacity and anthropometric variables play an important role in their competitive performance, which may be important when considering their power training.},

RECENT FINDINGS               As updated methods become available to neurologists, the ability to accurately identify and treat patients with memory disorders evolves. An appreciation of current concepts in the anatomic, physiologic, and psychological aspects of memory, combined with a rational application of everyday tools (such as clinical examination, bedside testing, standardized cognitive screening, and formal neuropsychological examination), allows the clinician to identify possible etiologies and track longitudinal changes in functional memory status. Recent findings regarding the interactions of limbic, anterior temporal, primary sensory, parietal, and dorsal prefrontal structures shed new light on the putative classifications of procedural and declarative memory and their subfunctions.

By combining elements of the history with examination, the goal is to identify patterns and an effective differential diagnosis for this group of patients to help lead to an accurate diagnosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past dozen years have changed the historical approach to patients with dizziness from one based primarily on how the patient describes the sensation of dizziness. This older approach can lead to misdiagnosis, so a preferred method puts greater emphasis on whether the dizziness is acute or chronic, episodic or continuous, or evoked by or brought on by an event or circumstance so that a pattern may be derived that better narrows the differential diagnosis and focused examination can further narrow to a cause or causes.

Recent Findings:               Improved methods of diagnosing patients with vertigo and dizziness have been evolving, including additional diagnostic criteria and characterization of some common conditions that cause dizziness (eg, vestibular migraine, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, chronic subjective dizziness). Other uncommon causes of dizziness (eg, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, episodic ataxia type 2) have also been better clarified. Distinguishing between central and peripheral causes of vertigo can be accomplished reliably through history and examination, but imaging techniques have further added to accuracy. What has not changed is the necessity of obtaining a basic history of the patient's symptoms to narrow the list of possible causes.                                         Summary:               Dizziness and vertigo are extremely common symptoms that also affect function at home and at work. Improvements in the diagnosis and management of the syndromes that cause dizziness and vertigo will enhance patient care and cost efficiencies in a health care system with limited resources.

RECENT FINDINGS               Gene therapies have become a reality for several neuromuscular disorders. Exon-skipping and (in Europe) ribosomal read-through approaches are currently available to a subset of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Microdystrophin gene replacement has shown promise and is nearing the final stages of clinical trials. Numerous gene-based therapies for other muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are progressing toward approval as well.                                         SUMMARY               Muscular dystrophies and congenital myopathies are a heterogenous group of hereditary muscle disorders. Confirming a diagnosis with genetic testing is not only critical for guiding management, but also an actual prerequisite for current and future gene therapies. Recessive loss-of-function or dominant haploinsufficiency disorders may be treated with gene replacement strategies, whereas dominant negative and toxic gain-of-function disorders are best addressed with a variety of knockdown approaches. It is important to recognize that many therapeutics are mutation specific and will only benefit a subset of individuals with a specific disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While return to sport (RTS) in young athletes after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has been well studied, little is known regarding their rate of RTS after multiligament knee injury (MLKI). PURPOSE: To assess the level of and factors associated with RTS after MLKI in young athletes. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 116 patients aged {$\leq$}23 years who had sustained an injury to {$\geq$}2 knee ligaments and undergone operative reconstruction or repair of {$\geq$}1 ligament. Our primary outcome was self-reported RTS at the preinjury level or higher. We estimated the likelihood of RTS using binomial logistic regression. Secondary variables included the 2000 International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SF), ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI), and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) physical and mental health summaries. RESULTS: A total of 30 (25.9\%) patients (24 men, 6 women; mean age, 18.1 {\textpm} 2.5 years) completed patient-reported outcome surveys at a mean follow-up of 7.8 years (median, 6.6 years [range, 1.1-19.5 years]). A total of 28 patients underwent surgical treatment of {$\geq$}2 ligaments. RTS was achieved by 90\% of patients, and 43.3\% returned to their preinjury level or higher. Patients who had played sports at a higher level before injury were more likely to RTS at their preinjury level or higher (odds ratio [OR], 3.516 [95\% CI, 1.034-11.955]; P = .044), while those who played cutting sports were less likely to do so (OR, 0.013 [95\% CI, 0.000-0.461; P = .017). Patients who achieved RTS at their preinjury level or higher had significantly higher IKDC-SF and ACL-RSI scores versus patients who did not (P = .001 and P = .002, respectively). The number of ligaments injured, age, mental health diagnosis, and SF-12 scores were not associated with the ability to RTS at the preinjury or higher levels. CONCLUSION: Most young athletes who sustained MLKI were able to return to play at some level, but a minority returned to their preinjury level. Patients who did return at preinjury or higher levels had higher IKDC-SF and ACL-RSI scores than those who did not. Performance in cutting and/or pivoting sports was negatively associated with RTS.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Rather than a disease, a disease process, or relating to specific cellular vulnerability, the term                 hereditary myelopathy                 refers to diverse inherited disorders in which major aspects of the clinical syndrome reflect disturbance of elements within the spinal cord (specifically, the dorsal columns and dorsal root ganglia, corticospinal tracts, and anterior horn cells). It is important to note that the clinical features of almost all hereditary myelopathies reflect not only disturbance of elements within the spinal cord but also disturbance of extraspinal structures (particularly, but not limited to, peripheral nerves and the cerebellum) and that these extraspinal clinical features can be very helpful in recognizing specific myelopathy syndromes. The value of classifying disorders as inherited myelopathies lies primarily in facilitating their clinical recognition and differential diagnosis. It is useful to recognize that many hereditary myelopathies conform to one of four clinical paradigms: (1) spinocerebellar ataxia, (2) motor neuron disorder, (3) leukodystrophy, or (4) distal motor-sensory axonopathy predominantly affecting the central nervous system. Although they are myelopathies, spinal dysraphisms such as spina bifida and myelomeningocele are not included in this context because they are not usually due to single-gene mutation and have low hereditability.

This article also provides an overview of the emerging clinical scenarios in which paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders may occur.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The number of autoantibodies associated with paraneoplastic neurologic disorders has rapidly expanded over the past 2 decades. These discoveries have improved our ability to diagnose patients with these disorders and have provided insight into their pathogenesis. It is now recognized that these antibodies can be broadly divided into two major categories based on the location of the target antigen: intracellular and cell surface/synaptic. Antibodies to intracellular antigens are almost always accompanied by cancer, respond less well to immunotherapy, and have an unfavorable outcome. In contrast, antibodies to cell surface or synaptic targets are less often accompanied by cancer, generally respond well to immunotherapy, and have a good prognosis. Paraneoplastic and autoimmune neurologic disorders are now being recognized in novel settings, including their occurrence as an immune-related adverse effect of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for cancer.                                         SUMMARY               This article discusses when to suspect a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, the diagnostic utility and pitfalls of neural autoantibody testing, how to best detect the underlying tumor, and the treatment approach that involves combinations of antineoplastic treatments, immunosuppressants, and supportive/symptomatic treatments.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Unruptured intracranial aneurysms and vascular malformations are detected more frequently because of the increased use and availability of brain imaging. Management of these entities requires knowledge of which patients are at high risk for hemorrhage and what treatment options are available. This article summarizes the epidemiology, natural history, and management strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, developmental venous anomalies, and capillary telangiectasias.                                         Recent Findings:               Pooled cohort studies and meta-analyses have improved the ability to predict hemorrhage for each vascular abnormality. Scores and tools have been developed to aid the practitioner in predicting hemorrhage risk for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Advances in endovascular techniques for unruptured intracranial aneurysms have improved the ability to treat difficult wide-necked aneurysms.                                         Summary:               Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are a common incidental finding. The PHASES (population, hypertension, age, size of aneurysm, earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage from another aneurysm, site of aneurysm) score and Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment Score may be useful tools for predicting natural history and treatment recommendations. The overall risk of hemorrhage for both arteriovenous malformations and cavernous malformations is about 2\% to 4\% per year. With both of these entities, prior hemorrhage predicts future hemorrhage. In addition, other select patient and radiologic factors influence risk of hemorrhage. The risk of future hemorrhage should be compared to the risk of treatment. Developmental venous anomalies and capillary telangiectasias are largely benign entities and rarely symptomatic.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with primary malignant brain tumors generally have a poor prognosis and experience progressive neurologic decline and significant physical and psychological symptoms. Management of these symptoms, including fatigue, mood disorders, and the manifestations of cerebral edema, can be challenging. Caregivers for these patients have high rates of psychological distress and report significant caregiving burden. Although the benefit of early palliative care for patients with other advanced solid tumors is well established, our understanding of the role of palliative care in neuro-oncology is incomplete, and thus palliative care and hospice services remain underutilized.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with brain tumors and their caregivers have significant supportive care needs, which often differ from the needs of patients with cancers outside of the nervous system. Clinicians face challenges associated with managing patients' symptoms and adequately facilitating prognostic understanding and decision making. Palliative care and hospice services may offer important benefits for this population.},

Performance of two aerial variations (Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR)) was also measured, with variables relating to technical performance (critical feature and subjective ratings) and potential injury risk (relative total peak landing force and loading rates) collected. Multiple linear regressions were used to predict performance of both aerial variations based on a subset of independent variables. Four models could predict performance. Predicted technical capability in the FAR was mostly influenced by lead limb hip extension and lead limb knee flexion range of motion. Potential injury risk when surfers perform an FA and FAR was predicted to be mitigated by increasing lead ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, as well as trail hip extensor mobility to reduce the relative total peak force experienced when landing the FA. These simple outcome measures could be routinely assessed to ensure successful and safe aerial landings in surfing.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(10): 3003-3011, 2020-To successfully and safely perform surfing maneuvers, surfers and their coaches need to know how to perform each maneuver correctly. Although some components of the sport are well understood, evidence-based recommendations in the scientific literature on how to perform surfing skills are sparse. The aim of this article was to systematically review the body of literature pertaining to discrete wave-riding skills and characteristics that are associated with the ability of surfers to successfully perform them. Searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus with Full-text, and Web of Science were undertaken in January 2019, to identify the most appropriate literature, with secondary searches of reference lists used to create a greater pool of possible articles. The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Ten studies deemed appropriate for review captured data from 299 surfers, who were predominantly competitive (78.3\%) and male (58.2\%). The average Down and Black Quality Index of the articles was 76.3 {\textpm} 8.4\%, with these articles focusing on the "pop-up" and landing skills. Performance indicators, such as isometric push-up peak forces, force-plate derived and in-water time to pop-up, relative peak forces generated when landing and time-to-stabilization, were all shown to be related to the physical characteristics of surfers and could affect the ability of surfers to successfully ride a wave. Findings from the studies included in this review suggest that the pop-up and landing exhibit trainable qualities that coaches and athletes can use to improve surfing performance.},

  abstract = {We aimed to determine whether there were any differences in how surfers used their lead and trail limbs when landing two variations of a simulated aerial manoeuvre, and whether technique affected the forces generated at landing. Fifteen competitive surfers (age 20.3~{\textpm}~5.6~years, height 178.2~{\textpm}~9.16 cm, mass 71.0~{\textpm}~10.5 kg) performed a Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR), while we collected the impact forces, ankle and knee muscle activity, and kinematic data. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce 41 dependent variables into 10 components. A two-way MANOVA revealed that although there were no limb x aerial variation interactions, surfers generated significantly higher relative loading rates at landing for the trail limb compared to the lead limb (+28.8 BW/s; F(1,303)~=~20.660, p {$<~$}0.0001, {$\eta$}2~=~0.064). This was likely due to the surfers "slapping" the trail limb down when landing, rather than controlling placement of the limb. Similarly, higher relative loading rates were generated when landing the FA compared to the FAR (+23.6 BW/s; F(1,303)~=~31.655, p {$<~$}0.0001, {$\eta$}2~=~0.095), due to less time over which the forces could be dissipated. No relationships between aerial variation or limb were found for any of the kinematic or muscle activity data. Practitioners should consider the higher relative loading rates generated by a surfer's trail limb and when surfers perform a FA when designing dry-land training to improve the aerial performance of surfing athletes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Physical preparation of competitive surfers includes substantial dry-land training. It is currently unknown, however, how closely these exercises replicate surfing maneuvers performed in the ocean. This study compared the technique features displayed by surfers when landing simulated aerial maneuvers on land to critical features previously established as necessary for surfers to successfully land aerials in the ocean during competition. METHODS: Fourteen competitive surfers (age 20.6~{\textpm}~5.7~years, height 178.1~{\textpm}~9.50~cm, mass 70.6~{\textpm}~10.8~kg) were recruited to perform two variations of a simulated aerial task, a Frontside Air (FA) and Frontside Air Reverse (FAR). Joint ranges of motion (ROM), center of pressure, and apparent gaze data were collected during the landing event. Paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to identify any significant differences in the outcome variables between the two aerial tasks. RESULTS: Participants displayed 100\% and 60\% of the critical features associated with successfully landing a FA and FAR, respectively. In both the simulated FA and FAR, participants landed in 1.0-3.7{$^\circ$} of dorsiflexion, moving through significantly less ankle joint ROM in the lead limb during the FAR (P~{$<~$}.01). Participants also displayed significantly less knee and hip ROM (P~=~.002-.048) while landing the FAR compared to the FA. CONCLUSION: The simulated FA and FAR tasks are appropriate training tools for surfers to replicate most of the critical features that a surfer should display to successfully land aerial maneuvers in the ocean. These tasks therefore enable surfers to practice these complex movements in a controlled environment.},

Four different surfboard fins, including conventional, single-grooved, and double-grooved fins, were developed using computer-aided design combined with additive manufacturing (3D printing). We systematically installed these 3D-printed fins into instrumented surfboards, which six accomplished surfers rode on waves in the ocean in a random order while blinded to the fin condition. We quantified the surfers' wave-riding performance during each surfing bout using a sport-specific tracking device embedded in each instrumented surfboard. After each fin condition, the surfers rated their perceptions of the Drive, Feel, Hold, Speed, Stiffness, and Turnability they experienced while performing turns using a visual analogue scale. Relationships between the surfer's perceptions of the fins and their surfing performance data collected from the tracking devices were then examined. The results revealed that participants preferred the single-grooved fins for Speed and Feel, followed by double-grooved fins, commercially available fins, and conventional fins without grooves. Crucially, the surfers' perceptions of their performance matched the objective data from the embedded sensors. Our findings demonstrate that accomplished surfers can perceive how changes to surfboard fins influence their surfing performance.},

Survivors of childhood stroke and their families are often left to cope with long-lasting sequelae, such as barriers to school reentry and long-term challenges in attaining independence as adults. Because childhood stroke is rare and providers may not be familiar with the disorder, this article reviews the risk factors, acute management, and sequelae of ischemic stroke in children.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               High-quality evidence has resulted in an organized approach to emergent treatment of ischemic stroke in adults, but most front-line providers are less prepared for emergent stroke management in children. The level of evidence for reperfusion therapies in children remains low but is growing. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are sometimes considered for hyperacute treatment of stroke in children. Readiness for pediatric stroke at regional centers should include an organized approach to pediatric stroke triage and management based on extrapolation from adult stroke trials, expert consensus, and emerging pediatric studies.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               This review provides up-to-date information about ischemic stroke risk factors and management in children.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) expresses both the extent of the improvement and the value that patients place on it. MCID use is becoming increasingly widespread to understand the clinical efficacy of a given treatment, define guidelines for clinical practice, and properly interpret trial results. However, there is still large heterogeneity in the different calculation methods. PURPOSE: To calculate and compare the MCID threshold values of a PROM by applying various methods and analyzing their effect on the study results interpretation. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The data set used to investigate the different MCID calculation approaches was based on a database of 312 patients affected by knee osteoarthritis and treated with intra-articular platelet-rich plasma. MCID values were calculated on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score at 6 months using 2 approaches: 9 methodologies referred to an anchor-based approach and 8 methodologies to a distribution-based approach. The obtained threshold values were applied to the same series of patients to understand the effect of using different MCID methods in evaluating patient response to treatment. RESULTS: The different methods employed led to MCID values ranging from 1.8 to 25.9 points. The anchor-based methods ranged from 6.3 to 25.9, while the distribution-based ones were from 1.8 to 13.8 points, showing a 4.1{\texttimes} variation of the MCID values within the anchor-based methods and a 7.6{\texttimes} variation within the distribution-based methods. The percentage of patients who reached the MCID for the IKDC subjective score changed based on the specific calculation method used. Among the anchor-based methods, this value varied from 24.0\% to 66.0\%, while among the distribution-based methods, the percentage of patients reaching the MCID varied from 44.6\% to 75.9\%. CONCLUSION: This study proved that different MCID calculation methods lead to highly heterogeneous values, which significantly affect the percentage of patients achieving the MCID in a given population. The wide-ranging thresholds obtained with the different methodologies make it difficult to evaluate the real effectiveness of a given treatment questioning the usefulness of MCID, as currently available, in the clinical research.},

This atraumatic thoracic/conus medullaris myelopathy with only a 42\% neurological recovery rate almost uniformly affects young, healthy, novice surfers who have no pre-existent spinal disease. Symptoms usually start with back pain and rapidly progress to complete or incomplete myelopathy. T2 magnetic resonance images show increased signal in the central spinal cord within 24 to 72 hours. Gadolinium enhancement and diffusion-weighted imaging are not helpful. Angiography has been underused. Angiogram in our case showed the absence of a right T12 radicular artery and no artery of Adamkiewicz, which, along with clinical findings, support the vascular origin theory. Incomplete cases often improve within 24 hours of onset, whereas no improvement has been reported for American Spinal Injury Association class A cases. Several acute interventions have been tried. Steroids are most common, and patients receiving steroids improved 55\% of the time with no reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Surfer's myelopathy is a clinical entity associated with complete deficit in {$>$}50\% of cases. Its prognosis is almost exclusively dictated by severity at presentation/nadir. Thus, publicizing this rare but serious condition (within and outside the medical literature) may be an effective intervention.},

  abstract = {Initially designed to identify children's movement impairments in clinical settings, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) is also widely used to evaluate children's movement in research. Standardised scores on the test are calculated using parametric methods under the assumption of normally-distributed data. In a pilot study with thirty five 8-10 year old children (i.e., in Age Band 2 of the MABC-2), we found that maximal performance was often reached. These 'ceiling effects' created distributions of scores that may violate parametric assumptions. Tests of normality, skew, and goodness-of-fit revealed this violation, most clearly on three of the eight sub-tests. A strong deviation from normality was again observed in a sample of 161 children (8-10 years, Experiment 1), however ceiling effects were reduced by modifying the scoring methods, and administering items designed for older children when maximal performance was reached. Experiment 2 (n = 81, 7-10 years) further refined the administration and scoring methods, and again improved the distributions of scores. Despite reducing ceiling effects, scores remained non-parametrically distributed, justifying non-parametric analytic approaches. By randomly and repeatedly resampling from the raw data, we generated non-parametric reference distributions for assigning percentiles to each child's performance, and compared the results with the standardised scores. Distributions of scores obtained with both parametric and non-parametric methods were skewed, and the methods resulted in different rankings of the same data. Overall, we demonstrate that some MABC-2 item scores are not normally-distributed, and violate parametric assumptions. Changes in administering and scoring may partially address these issues. We propose that resampling or other non-parametric methods are required to create new reference distributions to which an individual child's performance can be referred. The modifications we propose are preliminary, but the implication is that a new standardisation is required to deal with the non-parametric data acquired with the MABC-2 performance test.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Headache disorders attributed to low and high intracranial pressure are commonly encountered in specialty headache practices and may occur more frequently than realized. While the headaches resulting from intracranial pressure disorders have what are conventionally thought of as defining characteristics, a substantial minority of patients do not manifest the ``typical'' features. Moreover, patients with intracranial pressure disorders may also have a preexisting primary headache disorder. Heightening the complexity of the presentation, the headaches of intracranial pressure disorders can resemble the phenotype of a primary disorder. Lastly, patients with so-called intracranial ``hypotension'' often have normal CSF pressure and neuroimaging studies. Thus, a high index of suspicion is needed. The published literature has inherent bias as many types of specialists evaluate and treat these conditions. This article reviews the key points to emphasize the history, examination, and laboratory evaluation of patients with intracranial pressure disorders from a neurologist's perspective.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Lumbar puncture opening pressure in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension was low enough to meet diagnostic criteria ({$\leq$}60 mm CSF) in only 34\% of patients in one study. Most patients had an opening pressure in the low normal to normal range, and 5\% had an opening pressure of 200 mm CSF or more. Diskogenic microspurs are a common cause of this syndrome. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial found that most participants had a headache phenotype resembling migraine or tension-type headache. No ``typical'' or characteristic headache phenotype was found, and headache-related disability was severe at baseline. Headache disability did not correlate with the lumbar puncture opening pressure at baseline or at the 6-month primary outcome period. Although participants who were randomly assigned to acetazolamide had a lower mean CSF opening pressure at 6 months, headache disability in that group was similar to the group who received placebo.                                         SUMMARY               Significant overlap is seen in the symptoms of high and low CSF pressure disorders and in those of primary headache disorders. Neurologists are frequently challenged by patients with headaches who lack the typical clinical signs or imaging features of the pseudotumor cerebri syndrome or spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Even when characteristic symptoms and signs are initially present, the typical features of both syndromes tend to lessen or resolve over time; consider these diagnoses in patients with long-standing ``chronic migraine'' who do not improve with conventional headache treatment. While the diagnostic criteria for pseudotumor cerebri syndrome accurately identify most patients with the disorder, at least 25\% of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension have normal imaging and over half have a normal lumbar puncture opening pressure. Detailed history taking will often give clues that suggest a CSF pressure disorder. That said, misdiagnosis can lead to significant patient morbidity and inappropriate therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The major advance in the field of tardive syndromes has been the development and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, for treating tardive syndromes. These medications are derivatives of tetrabenazine and reduce dyskinetic movements by reducing dopamine stimulation. Treatment is not curative, and the medications reduce, or ``mask,'' symptoms but presumably without adding to the long-term risk of increased involuntary movements believed to accrue from suppressive treatment with dopamine receptor--blocking drugs. A confounding advance has been the accumulation of data finding that second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, may not be safer than first-generation antipsychotics in causing tardive syndromes. The public health risk of tardive syndromes may actually have increased as some second-generation antipsychotics, widely promoted to both doctors and patients, are increasingly used as antidepressants.                                         SUMMARY               Tardive syndromes remain a public health risk. Second-generation antipsychotics have not been proven to have less risk than first-generation drugs in causing tardive syndromes and are nevertheless being used more widely to treat depression, bipolar disease, and insomnia. Symptomatic treatment for tardive syndromes is available, although expensive.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal management of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults with acute ACL injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of later ACL reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)--pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS(4); range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100 [best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five KOOS subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner Activity Scale. RESULTS: Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS(4) score from baseline to 2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95\% confidence interval, -6.5 to 6.8; P=0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received. CONCLUSIONS: In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency of surgical reconstructions.

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to test if lateral preferences of surfers are associated with behaviour and performance depending on the direction of a breaking wave. We hypothesized that wave direction and surf stance interact in creating favourable or debilitative performance demands as surfers are either facing the wave (frontside) or the wave is breaking in the back of the surfers (backside). Study 1 was an online survey collecting self-report data of recreational surfers (n\,=\,394). In Study 2, we analysed all wave scores (n\,=\,2,552) and laterality of professional surfers during the season of 2014. Study 1 demonstrated that recreational surfers preferred surfing frontside and described themselves as more skilful when surfing frontside as this is facilitative for picking up visual information. Study 2 did not provide clear evidence that professional surfers on average scored higher during contests when surfing frontside, but when professional surfers had a choice of surfing frontside vs. backside, they were more likely to surf frontside. We discuss the diverging findings between Study 1 and Study 2 from the "circumvention-of-limits" argumentation within the expertise literature as professional surfers most likely have acquired skills allowing them to compensate for debilitative individual and environmental circumstances.},

Concurrent validity is based on the comparison of the HALO{\copyright} and inclinometer. To determine if active range of motion (AROM) differences exists between prone and supine when assessing shoulder internal (IR) and external rotation (ER). DESIGN: The design included clinical measurement, reliability and validity. METHODS: Thirty shoulders (mean age = 26.8 years) without pathology were evaluated. Measurements were taken in supine and prone with both an inclinometer and HALO{\copyright} device. RESULTS: Active ER ROM in prone was significantly higher than in supine when using both devices. Intra-rater reliability (within and between session) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values ranged between 0.82-0.99 for both devices in supine and prone. An ICC test revealed a significant (p {$<$} 0.01) correlation for both devices in IR and ER movements (ICC3,1 = 0.87 and ICC3,1 = 0.72), respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has shown prone assessment of active ER and IR ROM to be a reliable and appropriate method for prone dominant athletes (swimmers and surfers).

OBJECTIVES: To develop a reliable method to quantify thoracic mobility in the sagittal plane; to assess the reliability of an existing thoracic rotation method, and quantify thoracic mobility in an elite male surfing population. DESIGN: Clinical Measurement, reliability and comparative study. METHODS: A total of 30 subjects were used to determine the reliability component. 15 elite surfers were used as part of a comparative analysis with age and gender matched controls. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficient values ranged between 0.95-0.99 (95\% CI; 0.89-0.99) for both thoracic methods. The elite surfing group had significantly (p~{$\leq~$}0.05) greater rotation than the comparative group (mean rotation 63.57{$^\circ$} versus 40.80{$^\circ$}, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study has illustrated reliable methods to assess the thoracic spine in the sagittal plane and thoracic rotation. It has also quantified ROM in a surfing cohort; identifying thoracic rotation as a key movement. This information may provide clinicians, coaches and athletic trainers with imperative information regarding the importance of maintaining adequate thoracic rotation.},

V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak was significantly greater in competitive surfers than in recreational surfers (M = 40.71 {\textpm} 3.28 vs. 31.25 {\textpm} 6.31 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min, p {$<$} 0.001). This was also paralleled for anaerobic power (M = 303.93 vs. 264.58 W) for competitive surfers. Arm span and lean total muscle mass was significantly (p {$\leq$} 0.01) correlated with key performance variables (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power). No significant (p {$\geq$} 0.05) correlations were revealed between season rank and each of the variables of interest (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power). Key performance variables (V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak and anaerobic power) are significantly higher in competitive surfers, indicating that this is both an adaptation and requirement in this cohort. This battery of physiological tests could be used as a screening tool to identify an athlete's weaknesses or strengths. Coaches and clinicians could then select appropriate training regimes to address weaknesses.},

  abstract = {Background: Despite the high costs of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries to patients and society, we are not aware of any systematic reviews that have been performed on patient-reported outcome instruments designed for this patient population. The purpose of the present review is to identify currently available patient-reported outcome questionnaires for patients with ACL injuries, to appraise and assess the methodological quality and psychometric evidence of the evaluations of identified instruments, and to summarize the overall evidence for each included questionnaire. Methods: A computerized literature search was performed to identify articles appropriate for inclusion in this systematic review. Search terms were related to outcome instruments, ACL injuries, and psychometric properties. Two independent reviewers assessed the suitability of articles for inclusion. The methodological quality of instrument evaluation was assessed with use of the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. Psychometric properties were assessed with use of the quality criteria established by Terwee et al. The 2 assessments were synthesized to obtain an overall rating of the psychometric evidence for each questionnaire. Results: Forty-one studies investigating 24 instruments were included. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Form and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were the most frequently assessed instruments. The ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACLRSI) scale had 6 properties with positive evidence and was the highestquality instrument overall. Conclusions: Many of the included studies had low COSMIN ratings. The ACL-RSI is a reliable and valid scale to measure outcomes for patients with ACL injuries. Further assessments with improved methodological quality are needed to determine the psychometric properties of other instruments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) has been used to assess physical functioning in various chronic pain populations. There is a lack of evidence for its use with diverse pain populations who have high-impact chronic pain (HICP). The primary aim of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the PSFS with a heterogeneous sample of patients with HICP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study of prospective functional outcomes collected before and after participation in an intensive pain management program: PSFS, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, Neck Disability Index, Oswestry Disability Index, multidimensional patient impression of change, pain intensity, pain limitation, and fear-avoidance from the charts of 509 intensive pain management program completers. The reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the PSFS were analyzed using Cronbach {$\alpha$}, Pearson correlations, and receiver operating characteristics. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were found for all outcomes after program participation (all P {$<$} 0.0001). Correlations of the PSFS with similar outcomes (convergent validity) were lower than expected ( r = 0.16 to 0.33). A low correlation ( r = -0.12) with an unrelated measure, fear avoidance, supported divergent validity. PSFS change score correlations with similar outcome measures ranged from 0.46 to 0.53. The area under the curve values for the PSFS ranged from 0.801 to 0.857, suggesting a moderate ability for the PSFS to detect improvement. DISCUSSION: The psychometric properties of the PSFS showed mixed support for construct validity but good support for the responsiveness of the PSFS when used with a heterogeneous sample of patients with HICP.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Major advances have occurred in recognizing the genetic basis of nervous system malformations. Environmental causes of nervous system malformations, such as perinatal infections including Zika virus, are also reviewed. Treatment for nervous system malformations begins prior to birth with prevention. Folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects and is an important part of health maintenance for pregnant women. Fetal surgery is now available for prenatal repair of myelomeningocele and has been demonstrated to improve outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Each type of nervous system malformation is relatively uncommon, but, collectively, they constitute a large population of neurologic patients. The diagnosis of nervous system malformations begins with radiographic characterization. Genetic studies, including chromosomal microarray, targeted gene sequencing, and next-generation sequencing, are increasingly important aspects of the assessment. A genetic diagnosis may identify an associated medical condition and is necessary for family planning. Treatment consists primarily of supportive therapies for developmental delays and epilepsy, but prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele offers a glimpse of future possibilities. Prognosis depends on multiple clinical factors, including the examination findings, imaging characteristics, and genetic results. Treatment is best conducted in a multidisciplinary setting with neurology, neurosurgery, developmental pediatrics, and genetics working together as a comprehensive team.},

  abstract = {Context: Surfer's myelopathy (SM) is an acute syndrome identified by nontraumatic paraparesis or paraplegia. Though traditionally tied to first-time surfers, the condition encompasses any activity involving hyperextension of the back such as gymnastics, yoga, and Pilates.Methods: MEDLINE{\textregistered} and Google Scholar literature searches were gathered to identify relevant case reports for determining the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of SM.Results: While the rare nature of SM limits its full understanding, studies have pinpointed that hyperextension in the back leads to vasculature insufficiency secondary to dynamic compression of the artery of Adamkiewicz. In surfing, this hyperextension combined with the execution of the Valsalva maneuver while trying to stand up on the surfboard likely increases intraspinal pressure. Due to its nontraumatic origin, the presence of SM is not immediately clear. Moreover, its similarity in clinical and radiological presentations with other entities can further complicate diagnosis. Seemingly, idiopathic urological symptoms can be explained by the physician if they conduct a thorough history.Conclusion: In an effort to raise awareness for the practicing physician, we presently review the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prolonged effects of SM. With the surging popularity of surfing as well as the advent of children participating in precarious sports and activities at an earlier age, we can expect a rising incidence of traumatic and nontraumatic spinal cord injuries. Neurologists, urologists, emergency medicine and sports medicine physicians alike can utilize this review to build a high index of suspicion for SM. The risk factors for SM should be conveyed to those participating in novices in surfing, yoga, gymnastics, ballet, and any activity enabling sustained or repeated spinal extension. Increased general awareness will facilitate increased symptom recognition in order to arrest aggravation of injury.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Parasitic infections in humans are common, and many can affect the central nervous system where they may survive unnoticed or may cause significant pathology that can even lead to the death of the host. Neuroparasitoses should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurologic lesions, particularly in individuals from endemic regions or those with a history of travel to endemic regions.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebral malaria is a significant cause of mortality, particularly in African children, in whom infected red blood cells affect the cerebral vessels, causing severe encephalopathy. Neurocysticercosis is the most common cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide and has varied clinical presentations, depending on the number, size, and location of the parasites in the nervous system as well as on the host's inflammatory response. Toxoplasmosis is distributed worldwide, affecting a significant proportion of the population, and may reactivate in patients who are immunosuppressed, causing encephalitis and focal abscesses. Schistosomiasis causes granulomatous lesions in the brain or the spinal cord.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Four triptans are now labeled by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for acute migraine treatment in adolescents, and rizatriptan is labeled for use in children age 6 and older. For preventive migraine treatment, the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial demonstrated that approximately 60\% of children and adolescents with migraine will improve with a three-pronged treatment approach that includes: (1) lifestyle management counseling (on sleep, exercise, hydration, caffeine, and avoidance of meal skipping); (2) optimally dosed acute therapy, specifically nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans; and (3) a preventive treatment that has some evidence for efficacy. For the remaining 40\% of children and adolescents, and for those who would not have qualified for the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention trial because of having continuous headache or medication-overuse headache, the clinician's judgment remains the best guide to preventive therapy selection.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This explorative study analyses interrelationships between peripheral compounds in saliva, plasma, and muscles together with body composition variables in healthy subjects and in fibromyalgia patients (FM). There is a need to better understand the extent cytokines and chemokines are associated with body composition and which cytokines and chemokines differentiate FM from healthy controls. METHODS: Here, 32 female FM patients and 30 age-matched female healthy controls underwent a clinical examination that included blood sample, saliva samples, and pain threshold tests. In addition, the subjects completed a health questionnaire. From these blood and saliva samples, a panel of 68 mainly cytokines and chemokines were determined. Microdialysis of trapezius and erector spinae muscles, phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy of erector spinae muscle, and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for determination of body composition (BC)-i.e., muscle volume, fat content and infiltration-were also performed. RESULTS: After standardizing BC measurements to remove the confounding effect of Body Mass Index, fat infiltration and content are generally increased, and fat-free muscle volume is decreased in FM. Mainly saliva proteins differentiated FM from controls. When including all investigated compounds and BC variables, fat infiltration and content variables were most important, followed by muscle compounds and cytokines and chemokines from saliva and plasma. Various plasma proteins correlated positively with pain intensity in FM and negatively with pain thresholds in all subjects taken together. A mix of increased plasma cytokines and chemokines correlated with an index covering fat infiltration and content in different tissues. When muscle compounds were included in the analysis, several of these were identified as the most important regressors, although many plasma and saliva proteins remained significant. DISCUSSION: Peripheral factors were important for group differentiation between FM and controls. In saliva (but not plasma), cytokines and chemokines were significantly associated with group membership as saliva compounds were increased in FM. The importance of peripheral factors for group differentiation increased when muscle compounds and body composition variables were also included. Plasma proteins were important for pain intensity and sensitivity. Cytokines and chemokines mainly from plasma were also significantly and positively associated with a fat infiltration and content index. CONCLUSION: Our findings of associations between cytokines and chemokines and fat infiltration and content in different tissues confirm that inflammation and immune factors are secreted from adipose tissue.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reactive decision-making during athletic movement has been demonstrated to evoke unfavorable biomechanics associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. However, the current evidence is based on assessments of healthy individuals. We aimed to investigate unplanned jump landing kinetics and knee kinematics in ACL-reconstructed (ACLR) and non-injured athletes. METHODS: A total of 30 male professional soccer players (n\,=\,15 ACLR after return to play, n\,=\,15 matched controls) performed six drop landings onto a force plate. As a neurocognitive challenge requiring decision-making, a diode flashing in randomly selected colors indicated the requested landing location. Knee joint kinematics (flexion, valgus and tibial rotation angles) assessed with a 10-camera motion capture system, vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), time to stabilization (TTS) and length of the center of pressure (COP) trace (all analyzed from force plate data) were calculated. Cognitive function was assessed using the CNS Vital Signs battery. RESULTS: The ACLR group produced lower knee flexion angles than the control group (median [interquartile range] 50.00{$^\circ$} [6.60] vs. 55.20{$^\circ$} [4.45], p\,=\,.02). In addition, path length of the center of pressure (379~mm [56.20] vs. 344~mm [37.00], p\,=\,.04) and ground reaction force (3.21 N/kg [0.66] vs. 2.87 N/kg [0.48], p\,=\,.01) were higher for the ACLR group. No differences were found for knee valgus (p\,=\,.96), tibial rotation (p\,=\,.83) and TTS (p\,=\,.82). ACLR participants scored lower for reaction time (p\,=\,.02) and processing speed (p\,=\,.01). Unfavorable knee biomechanics were more often related to cognitive function in the ACLR group than in the control group (p\,{$<$}\,.05). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired reactive decision-making during athletic movement may contribute to the high re-injury risk in individuals with ACLR. Prospective studies confirming potential cause-effect relationships are warranted.},

Oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, accelerated arteriosclerosis, and uremic inflammatory milieu affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. This article reviews the unique contributions of renal impairment to neurologic disorders and their common clinical manifestations as the prevalence of renal disease increases in a globally aging population.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENT                                Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic interplay between the kidneys and brain, also referred to as the                 kidney-brain axis                 , have led to more widespread recognition of associated changes in neurovascular dynamics, central nervous system acidification, and uremia-associated endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Acute kidney injury increases mortality in acute brain injury to nearly 5 times that seen in matched controls. Renal impairment and its associated increased risks of intracerebral hemorrhage and accelerated cognitive decline are developing fields. Dialysis-associated neurovascular injury is increasingly recognized in both continuous and intermittent forms of renal replacement therapy, and treatment strategies for its prevention are evolving.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               This article summarizes the effects of renal impairment on the central and peripheral nervous systems with special considerations in acute kidney injury, patients requiring dialysis, and conditions that affect both the renal and nervous systems.},

  abstract = {The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like meclofenamate sodium (MS), used to reduce pain, has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Naproxen (NAP), another NSAID, is not associated with increased risk of CVD. The molecular mechanism(s) by which NSAIDs induce CVD is unknown. We investigated the effects of MS and NAP on protein homeostasis and cardiotoxicity in rat cardiac H9c2 cells and murine neonatal cardiomyocytes. MS, but not NAP, significantly inhibited proteasome activity and reduced cardiac cell viability at pharmacological levels found in humans. Although proteasome subunit gene and protein expression were unaffected by NSAIDs, MS treated cell lysates showed higher 20S proteasome content, while purified proteasomes from MS treated cells had lower proteasome activity and higher levels of oxidized subunits than proteasomes from control cells. Addition of exogenous proteasome to MS treated cells improved cell viability. Both MS and NAP increased ROS production, but the rate of ROS production was greater in MS than in NAP treated cells. The ROS production is likely from mitochondria, as MS inhibited mitochondrial Complexes I and III, major sources of ROS, while NAP inhibited Complex I. MS also impaired mitochondrial membrane potential while NAP did not. Antioxidants were able to prevent the reduced cell viability caused by MS treatment. These results suggest that NSAIDs induce cardiotoxicity by a ROS dependent mechanism involving mitochondrial and proteasome dysfunction and may explain why some NSAIDs should not be given to patients for long periods.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Despite the ubiquity of anxiety, the evidence is that most individuals with an anxiety disorder are not identified and do not receive guideline-level care. In part, this may be because of the manifold clinical presentations of anxiety disorders and clinicians' lack of confidence in accurately diagnosing and treating these conditions, especially in nonpsychiatric settings. Anxiety disorders represent the complex interplay between biological, psychological, temperamental, and environmental factors. Converging lines of evidence point to dysfunction in regulating activity in the ``threat circuit'' in the brain as a putative common pathophysiology underlying anxiety disorders. Evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications, have been shown to regulate activity in this circuit, which consists of reciprocal connections between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insula, and amygdala.                                         SUMMARY               Anxiety disorders are the most common class of emotional disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. A variety of effective treatment strategies are available, which may exert their therapeutic benefits from top-down or bottom-up modulation of the dysfunctional brain activity associated with anxiety disorders.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, indoor volleyball has experienced significant rule changes and a high player specialization in both sexes. Different spike attack arm swing techniques have developed which might affect performance and risk of injury. While a variety of arm swing techniques was already shown in world class beach volleyball players, it is unclear if this is also true for world class indoor volleyball. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the spike attack arm swing techniques of Olympic volleyball winners and finalists (1984-2021) and to investigate possible differences between sex, playing position, scoring system, and compared to beach volleyball. Eighty-two male (M) and 85 female (F) players were assessed from video recordings from ten competitions. Five different arm swing techniques in the cocking phase (Straight, Bow-and-arrow high, Bow-and-arrow low, Snap, Circular) were classified by two experts. The most frequent technique for both sexes was the Circular (M = 40.2\%; F = 38.8\%), followed by Snap (M = 28.0\%; F = 23.5\%), Bow-and-arrow low (M = 20.7\%; F = 21.2\%), Bow-and-arrow high (M = 7.3\% F = 11.8\%), and Straight (M = 3.7\%; F = 4.7\%). Bow-and-arrow high and Straight techniques were significantly less used than other techniques in both sexes. There were no significant differences (p \&gt; 0.05) in arm swing techniques between sexes, playing positions, and scoring system but significant differences (p \&lt; 0.001) to beach volleyball. Although most volleyball textbooks only describe the Bow-and-arrow techniques, most of the world class indoor volleyball players used Circular and Snap arm swing techniques. Reasons for that could be the implicit knowledge of players (and coaches) regarding increased performance (ball speed) and injury prevention. Based on these results we suggest to critically revise arm swing technique training especially for young players and players with shoulder problems.},

  abstract = {In a contemporary clinical laboratory it is very common to have to assess the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurement. The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods. In 1983 Altman and Bland (B\&A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement. The B\&A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95\% of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot. The B\&A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals. The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

The standard methodology for completing a skin biopsy, the anatomic structures of interest detected within a skin biopsy, and the disease states in which skin biopsies may provide valuable information are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Several recent advances in the studies of hereditary amyloidosis and the various degenerative synucleinopathies have demonstrated that simple skin biopsies can provide valuable pathologic evidence of neurologic disease. In addition to diagnosis of the underlying disorder, skin biopsies provide a quantitative structural measurement of the associated autonomic damage.                                         SUMMARY               Skin biopsies are making great inroads into the study of autonomic and peripheral nerve disorders. Complex immunohistochemical staining protocols are challenging to complete, but the rich data derived from these studies in the diagnosis and monitoring of different disease states suggest that the role of skin biopsies in the study of the autonomic nervous system will continue to expand in the years to come.},

Immobilization for three to four weeks followed by a structured 12-week rehabilitation program of range of motion and glenohumeral and scapular stability exercises for patients with primary dislocations to maximize return to premorbid activity level is supported by weak evidence. Level II evidence suggests that recurrence is lower in patients managed with surgical as compared with conservative management.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of neurologic complications of COVID-19 began to surface. A variety of neurologic conditions have since been reported in association with COVID-19. Understanding of the underlying mechanism of COVID-19 neurologic involvement continues to evolve; however, the evidence seems to suggest that aberrant inflammatory responses may play a role. In addition to neurologic symptoms in acute COVID-19, neurologic post--COVID-19 conditions are increasingly recognized. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has been essential in preventing the spread of COVID-19. With increasing numbers of vaccine doses administered, various neurologic adverse events have been reported.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists must be aware of the potential acute, postacute, and vaccine-associated neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 and be poised to serve as integral members of multidisciplinary care teams for patients with COVID-19--related conditions.},

The objectives of this study were to highlight key differences between interrater agreement and interrater reliability; describe the key concepts and approaches to evaluating interrater agreement and interrater reliability; and provide examples of their applications to research in the field of social and administrative pharmacy. This is a descriptive review of interrater agreement and interrater reliability indices. It outlines the practical applications and interpretation of these indices in social and administrative pharmacy research. Interrater agreement indices assess the extent to which the responses of 2 or more independent raters are concordant. Interrater reliability indices assess the extent to which raters consistently distinguish between different responses. A number of indices exist, and some common examples include Kappa, the Kendall coefficient of concordance, Bland-Altman plots, and the intraclass correlation coefficient. Guidance on the selection of an appropriate index is provided. In conclusion, selection of an appropriate index to evaluate interrater agreement or interrater reliability is dependent on a number of factors including the context in which the study is being undertaken, the type of variable under consideration, and the number of raters making assessments.},

The etiology is most often global hypoxia-ischemia due to failure of cerebral perfusion to the fetus caused by uterine, placental, or umbilical cord compromise prior to or during delivery. Other etiologies of neonatal encephalopathy include ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, infection, developmental anomalies, and inborn errors of metabolism.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Therapeutic hypothermia is standard of care for the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy presumed to be caused by hypoxia-ischemia. The number needed to treat is approximately 6 to 7 to prevent one child from either death or disability at age 18 to 22 months. EEG monitoring and MRI are important tools in determining the etiology of encephalopathy and prognosis of the infant.                                         SUMMARY               Neonatal encephalopathy is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by alterations in mental status, hypotonia, seizures, and abnormalities in feeding and respiration. The most common cause of neonatal encephalopathy is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, for which treatment with 72 hours of therapeutic hypothermia is associated with reduced death or disability.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Our understanding of memory formation advances each year. Successful episodic memory formation depends not only on intact medial temporal lobe structures but also on well-orchestrated interactions with other large-scale brain networks that support executive and semantic processing functions. Recent discoveries of cognitive control networks have helped in understanding the interaction between memory systems and executive systems. These interactions allow access to past experiences and enable comparisons between past experiences and external and internal information. The semantic memory system is less clearly defined anatomically. Anterior, lateral, and inferior temporal lobe regions appear to play a crucial role in the function of the semantic processing system. Different but tightly interconnected cortical regions, such as the prefrontal region, may play a controlling role in this system. The presentation of clinical disease affecting memory is the result of the selective vulnerability of the memory system. An understanding of current concepts of memory anatomy, physiology, and evaluation plays a central role in establishing an accurate diagnosis.                                         SUMMARY               Different memory systems rely on separate but overlapping distributed brain networks. Certain pathologic processes preferentially affect memory systems. An understanding of memory formation stages will enable more accurate diagnosis.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               ``Double vision'' is a commonly encountered concern in neurologic practice; the experience of diplopia is always sudden and is frequently a cause of great apprehension and potential disability for patients. Moreover, while some causes of diplopia are benign, others require immediate recognition, a focused diagnostic evaluation, and appropriate treatment to prevent vision- and life-threatening outcomes. A logical, easy-to-follow approach to the clinical evaluation of patients with diplopia is helpful in ensuring accurate localization, a comprehensive differential diagnosis, and optimal patient care. This article provides a foundation for formulating an approach to the patient with diplopia and includes practical examples of developing the differential diagnosis, effectively using confirmatory examination techniques, determining an appropriate diagnostic strategy, and (where applicable) providing effective treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent population-based analyses have determined that diplopia is a common presentation in both ambulatory and emergency department settings, with 850,000 such visits occurring annually. For patients presenting to an outpatient facility, diagnoses are rarely serious. However, potentially life-threatening causes (predominantly stroke or transient ischemic attack) can be encountered. In patients presenting with diplopia related to isolated cranial nerve palsy, immediate neuroimaging can often be avoided if an appropriate history and examination are used to exclude worrisome etiologies.                                         SUMMARY               Binocular diplopia is most often due to a neurologic cause. The onset of true ``double vision'' is debilitating for most patients and commonly prompts immediate access to health care services as a consequence of functional impairment and concern for worrisome underlying causes. Although patients may seek initial evaluation through the emergency department or from their primary care/ophthalmic provider, elimination of an ocular cause will not infrequently result in the patient being referred for neurologic consultation. A logical, localization-driven, and evidence-based approach is the most effective way to arrive at the correct diagnosis and provide the best outcome for the patient.},

The study's goal is to compare the effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) training in balance among individuals with incomplete paraplegia to that of functional electrical stimulation (FES). DESIGN: Two groups, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Neurological Physiotherapy Out Patient Department, Tertiary Care Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen people aged 18-60 years with incomplete SCI. INTERVENTIONS: VR training along with conventional physical therapy (CPT) and FES for Rectus Abdominis and Erector Spinae with CPT five times a week for 4 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were Modified Functional Reach Test (mFRT) and Function in Sitting Test (FIST) to assess sitting balance and Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM III) for the level of independence. Assessments were taken before initiating treatment and at the end of the 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. Within-group analyses for the mFRT values were performed using Repeated Measures ANOVA test, and between-group analyses were performed using the independent t-test test. Friedman and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for analyzing FIST and SCIM III. RESULTS: All variables (mFRT and FIST) improved significantly in both groups (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), with the VR\,+\,CPT group showing a more significant result than the FES\,+\,CPT group (P value\,{$<$}\,0.05), except for SCIM III. CONCLUSION: VR as an adjunct to CPT demonstrated proved to be an effective treatment to improve balance among individuals with incomplete paraplegia.Trial registration: Clinical Trials Registry India identifier: CTRI/2020/03/024080.},

  abstract = {The Movement Disorder Society Task Force for Rating Scales for Parkinson's disease (PD) prepared a critique of the Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY). Strengths of the HY scale include its wide utilization and acceptance. Progressively higher stages correlate with neuroimaging studies of dopaminergic loss, and high correlations exist between the HY scale and some standardized scales of motor impairment, disability, and quality of life. Weaknesses include the scale's mixing of impairment and disability and its non-linearity. Because the HY scale is weighted heavily toward postural instability as the primary index of disease severity, it does not capture completely impairments or disability from other motor features of PD and gives no information on nonmotor problems. Direct clinimetric testing of the HY scale has been very limited, but the scale fulfills at least some criteria for reliability and validity, especially for the midranges of the scale (Stages 2-4). Although a "modified HY scale" that includes 0.5 increments has been adopted widely, no clinimetric data are available on this adaptation. The Task Force recommends that: (1) the HY scale be used in its original form for demographic presentation of patient groups; (2) when the HY scale is used for group description, medians and ranges should be reported and analysis of changes should use nonparametric methods; (3) in research settings, the HY scale is useful primarily for defining inclusion/exclusion criteria; (4) to retain simplicity, clinicians should "rate what you see" and therefore incorporate comorbidities when assigning a HY stage; and (5) because of the wide usage of the modified HY scale with 0.5 increments, this adaptation warrants clinimetric testing. Without such testing, however, the original five-point scales should be maintained.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and motor syndromes are often intertwined in neurologic disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, atypical parkinsonian syndromes, Huntington disease, and other movement disorders. Cognitive symptoms often affect attention, working memory, and executive and visuospatial functions preferentially, rather than language and memory, but heterogeneity can be seen in the various movement disorders. A distinct cognitive syndrome has been recognized in patients with cerebellar syndromes. Appropriate recognition and screening for cognitive changes in movement disorders may play a role in achieving accurate diagnoses and guiding patients and their families regarding progression and management decisions.                                         SUMMARY               In the comprehensive care of patients with movement disorders, recognition of cognitive syndromes is important. Pharmacologic treatments for the cognitive syndromes, including mild cognitive impairment and dementia, in these movement disorders lag behind the therapeutics available for motor symptoms, and more research is needed. Patient evaluation and management require a comprehensive team approach, often linking neurologists as well as neuropsychologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other professionals.},

DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials, Scielo, and CINAHL (from the earliest date available to November 2014) for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of stabilization exercises compared to general exercises or manual therapy on pain, disability, and function in patients with low back pain. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria (413 stabilization exercises patients, 297 general exercises patients, and 185 manual therapy patients). Stabilization exercises may provide greater benefit than general exercise for pain reduction and improvement in disability. Stabilization exercise improved pain with a WMD of~-1.03 (95\% CI:~-1.29 to~-0.27) and improved disability with a WMD of~-5.41 (95\% CI:~-8.34 to~-2.49). There were no significant differences in pain and disability scores among participants in the stabilization exercise group compared to those in the manual therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization exercises were as efficacious as manual therapy in decreasing pain and disability and should be encouraged as part of musculoskeletal rehabilitation for low back pain.},

This article reviews cauda equina anatomy, the diagnostic approach to disorders of the cauda equina, features of cauda equina syndrome, and diskogenic and nondiskogenic disorders of the cauda equina.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing clinical criteria for cauda equina syndrome has been a focus of a number of reviews, although the clinician must maintain a low threshold for emergent imaging in cases of suspected cauda equina syndrome because of the suboptimal reliability of various signs and symptoms in identifying this condition clinically. The timing of surgical intervention for compressive causes of cauda equina dysfunction remains a point of contention, although urgent decompression remains standard practice. A recent review that focused on outcomes in patients with cauda equina compression who underwent surgical decompression identified significant residual deficits in patients despite appropriate and timely intervention.

To achieve this goal, a normal human heart must beat regularly and continuously for one's entire life. Heartbeats originate from the rhythmic pacing discharge from the sinoatrial (SA) node within the heart itself. In the absence of extrinsic neural or hormonal influences, the SA node pacing rate would be about 100 beats per minute. Heart rate and cardiac output, however, must vary in response to the needs of the body's cells for oxygen and nutrients under varying conditions. In order to respond rapidly to the changing requirements of the body's tissues, the heart rate and contractility are regulated by the nervous system, hormones, and other factors. Here we review how the cardiovascular system is controlled and influenced by not only a unique intrinsic system, but is also heavily influenced by the autonomic nervous system as well as the endocrine system.},

Diagnostic considerations and therapeutic options for individual diseases are also discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Paraneoplastic syndromes can affect the afferent and efferent visual systems. Paraneoplastic syndromes may result in reduced visual acuity from retinal degeneration, alterations in melanocyte proliferation and uveal thickening, or acquired nystagmus. Ocular motor abnormalities related to paraneoplastic syndromes may present with symptoms from opsoclonus or from neuromuscular junction disease. Diagnosis remains challenging, but serologic identification of some specific antibodies may be helpful or confirmatory. Treatment, in addition to directed therapies against the underlying cancer, often requires systemic corticosteroids, plasma exchange, or immunosuppression, but some specific syndromes improve with use of targeted pharmacologic therapy.

The spectrum of motor neuron diseases is reviewed, and the clinical heterogeneity of ALS is described.                                         Recent Findings:               ALS is increasingly recognized as a clinical spectrum disorder with pure upper and pure lower motor neuron presentations, supported by genetic links. The phenotypic variability is broad. Identification of ALS-related genes provides insights into disease mechanisms.                                         Summary:               ALS is a progressive fatal multisystem neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Clinical recognition of suspicious symptoms and the appropriate laboratory evaluation are essential to limit diagnostic delay and avoid unnecessary testing and procedures. ALS has broad genetic and hypothesized environmental causes and phenotypic variability. Recognizing related motor neuron diseases will prevent misdiagnosis while allowing proper disease counseling. Although ALS cannot be cured, implementation of appropriate symptomatic treatment is valuable.},

RECENT FINDINGS               IBM is an often-misdiagnosed myopathy subtype. Due to the insidious onset and slow progression of muscle weakness, it can often be dismissed as a sign of aging as it commonly presents in older adults. While challenging to recognize upon initial clinical evaluation, the recent recognition of specialized stains highlighting features seen on muscle pathology, the use of diagnostic tools such as the anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A antibody biomarker, and the ability of muscle imaging to detect patterns of preferential muscle involvement seen in IBM has allowed for earlier diagnosis of the disease than was previously possible. While the pathogenesis of IBM has historically been poorly understood, several ongoing studies point toward mechanisms of autophagy and highly differentiated cytotoxic T cells that are postulated to be pathogenic in IBM.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This article aims to evaluate patterns of chronic multiligament injuries and outcomes of treatment with single-stage reconstruction using autografts. METHODS: All patients with clinicoradiologically diagnosed multiligament knee injury (MKI) were included in this prospective observational study. As the time since injury was more than 6\,weeks in all of the patients, they were categorized as having chronic MKI. Patients were assessed clinically for laxity, and the diagnosis was confirmed radiologically. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for medial collateral ligament (MCL) or posterolateral corner reconstruction in a patient with Schenck knee dislocation (KD) type III. In these cases, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were reconstructed by using the peroneus longus and contralateral hamstring tendons respectively. Ipsilateral hamstring tendons were used for ACL reconstruction and an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft was used for reconstruction of the PCL in a KD type II injury. In two cases of KD type IV injury, the lateral laxity was only grade II and was managed conservatively; the rest of the ligaments were addressed like a KD type III injury. Outcome evaluation was done using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity level, preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 years' follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients of mean age 33.48\,{\textpm}\,9.9\,years with MKI were included in the study. The patients were classified as eight KD type II, 17 KD type III, and two KD type IV. The majority of the patients had associated meniscal (59.2\%) or chondral (40.7\%) injuries. At the 2\,years' follow-up visit, there were significant improvements in VAS score (p\,=\,0.0001) IKDC score (p\,=\,0.0001), Lysholm score (p\,=\,0.0001), and range of motion (p\,=\,0.001). None of the patients had residual laxity on clinical examination of the knee joint at the 2 years' follow-up. All but two of the patients went back to their previous activity level. These two patients had progressive knee arthritis and needed knee arthroplasty. CONCLUSION: Single-stage surgical reconstruction for chronic MKI has favourable functional outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, case series.},

New studies have shed light on its epidemiology and pathogenesis and provided objective ways to measure outcome in patients with NPH. Neuroimaging has improved and allows better recognition of both NPH and the presence of overlapping diseases                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Several recent epidemiologic studies confirm that NPH is a rare disease, but the presence of large ventricles is a common finding with aging. NPH may be multifactorial, including congenital causes, vascular disease, and impaired CSF absorption. MRI features of NPH include enlarged ventricular size and CSF fluid collection outside the ventricles not due to atrophy. The term                 disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus                 (DESH) has been used to describe prognostic MRI features in NPH, including a ``tight high convexity'' and enlargement of CSF spaces in the sylvian fissure. DESH has been included in the Japanese guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of NPH. A new NPH scale has been published that provides an objective framework for evaluating patients with NPH before and after shunt placement. Programmable shunts can noninvasively manage overdrainage complications. Surgical outcome has been improving over time. Recent studies have led to improved recognition of overlapping diseases such as Alzheimer pathology, which co-occurs in about 30\% of NPH cases. Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a promising imaging modality for diagnosing NPH and detecting concomitant degenerative disease.                                                        SUMMARY               A systematic approach to patients with possible NPH allows recognition of the subset of patients who will respond to shunt surgery and identification of those with alternative diagnoses.},

These patients had involvement of frontal structures, impaired appreciation of nonsimple humor, and a compulsion for disinhibited joking.

  abstract = {"The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your beliefs and to know what you don't know, which can position you for success at work and happiness at home. The difficulty of rethinking our assumptions is surprisingly common--maybe even fundamentally human. Our ways of thinking become habits that we don't bother to question, and mental laziness leads us to prefer the ease of old routines to the difficulty of new ones. We fail to update the beliefs we formed in the past for the challenges we face in the present. But in a rapidly changing world, we need to spend as much time rethinking as we do thinking. Think Again is a book about the benefit of doubt, and about how we can get better at embracing the unknown and the joy of being wrong. Evidence has shown that creative geniuses are not attached to one identity but constantly willing to rethink their stances, that leaders who admit they don't know something and seek critical feedback lead more productive and innovative teams, and that our greatest presidents have been open to updating their views. The new science of intellectual humility shows that as a mindset and a skillset, rethinking can be taught, and Grant explains how to develop the necessary qualities. The first section of the book explores why we struggle to think again and how we can improve individually, and argues that such engines of success as "grit" can actually be counterproductive; the second section discusses how we can help others think again through the skill of "argument literacy"; and the third looks at how institutions like schools, business, and governments fall short in building cultures that encourage rethinking. In the end, it's intellectual humility that makes it possible for us to stop denying our weaknesses so that we can start improving ourselves"--},

METHODS: PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Index to Chiropractic Literature were searched from 2000 through September 2006 using the following search terms: case report, authorship, peer review, and manuscript. Relevant manuscripts were retrieved and the results were used to update a previous narrative overview of the literature. DISCUSSION: Commensurate with the increased use of evidence-based health care and recent changes in publication requirements, new standards are expected of case reports. Case reports should present new information to the literature and be written succinctly. The types of case reports available are discussed. Steps for preparing a case report are described based upon the current available literature. CONCLUSION: Case reports are important contributions to the health sciences literature. Proper preparation of this study design is necessary in order for it to be published. A self-evaluation check sheet for authors is included to assist in the writing process.},

  abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. BACKGROUND: In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. METHODS: Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. DISCUSSION: An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a 'best-evidence synthesis' approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. CONCLUSION: Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Gross motor assessment tools have a critical role in identifying, diagnosing and evaluating motor difficulties in childhood. The objective of this review was to systematically evaluate the psychometric properties and clinical utility of gross motor assessment tools for children aged 2-12 years. METHOD: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED was performed between May and July 2017. Methodological quality was assessed with the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments checklist and an outcome measures rating form was used to evaluate reliability, validity and clinical utility of assessment tools. RESULTS: Seven assessment tools from 37 studies/manuals met the inclusion criteria: Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III), Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2 (BOT-2), Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2), McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND), Neurological Sensory Motor Developmental Assessment (NSMDA), Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2) and Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2). Methodological quality varied from poor to excellent. Validity and internal consistency varied from fair to excellent ({$\alpha$}=0.5-0.99). The Bayley-III, NSMDA and MABC-2 have evidence of predictive validity. Test-retest reliability is excellent in the BOT-2 (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.80-0.99), PDMS-2 (ICC=0.97), MABC-2 (ICC=0.83-0.96) and TGMD-2 (ICC=0.81-0.92). TGMD-2 has the highest inter-rater (ICC=0.88-0.93) and intrarater reliability (ICC=0.92-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of gross motor assessments for children have good-excellent validity. Test-retest reliability is highest in the BOT-2, MABC-2, PDMS-2 and TGMD-2. The Bayley-III has the best predictive validity at 2 years of age for later motor outcome. None of the assessment tools demonstrate good evaluative validity. Further research on evaluative gross motor assessment tools are urgently needed.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Some microorganisms exhibit neurotropism for the spinal cord (eg, enteroviruses such as poliovirus and flaviviruses such as West Nile virus), while others are more protean in neurologic manifestations (eg, herpesviruses such as varicella-zoster virus), and others are only rarely reported to cause myelopathy (eg, certain fungal and parasitic infections). Individuals who are immunocompromised are at increased risk of disseminated infection to the central nervous system. Within the last few years, an enterovirus D68 outbreak has been associated with cases of acute flaccid paralysis in children, and emerging Zika virus infection has been concurrent with cases of acute flaccid paralysis due to Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, although cases of myelitis have also been reported. Associated pathogens differ by geographic distribution, with myelopathies related to                 Borrelia burgdorferi                 (Lyme disease) and West Nile virus more commonly seen in the United States and parasitic infections encountered more often in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Neurologic complications of HIV may be caused by direct virally mediated pathology, immune-mediated phenomena in response to viral infection, or opportunistic infections secondary to depletion of lymphocytes. These neurologic disorders may be influenced by the degree of immunosuppression (ie, CD4+ T-cell lymphocyte count) and stage of infection (early versus late), as well as use of antiretroviral therapy, and may manifest as a variety of central and peripheral neurologic syndromes, including the more commonly encountered HIV-associated cognitive disorders and length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy, respectively.

There is sparse evidence to guide return to sport (RTS) decisions in this population. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between knee reinjury after ACL reconstruction and (1) return to level I sports, (2) timing of RTS and (3) knee function prior to return. METHODS: 106 patients who participated in pivoting sports participated in this prospective 2-year cohort study. Sports participation and knee reinjury were recorded monthly. Knee function was assessed with the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale, global rating scale of function, and quadriceps strength and hop test symmetry. Pass RTS criteria were defined as scores {$>$}90 on all tests, failure as failing any. RESULTS: Patients who returned to level I sports had a 4.32 (p=0.048) times higher reinjury rate than those who did not. The reinjury rate was significantly reduced by 51\% for each month RTS was delayed until 9\>months after surgery, after which no further risk reduction was observed. 38.2\% of those who failed RTS criteria suffered reinjuries versus 5.6\% of those who passed (HR 0.16, p=0.075). More symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return significantly reduced the knee reinjury rate. CONCLUSIONS: Returning to level I sports after ACL reconstruction leads to a more than 4-fold increase in reinjury rates over 2\>years. RTS 9\>months or later after surgery and more symmetrical quadriceps strength prior to return substantially reduce the reinjury rate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Magnesium plays a key role in bone health and may, therefore, represent an interesting nutrient for the prevention of bone loss and osteoporosis. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the impact of magnesium intake from any source on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone turnover markers, and fracture risk in older adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Embase, Medline Ovid and Cochrane Central from database inception to October 2020. All studies that related magnesium intake with bone health outcomes among adults aged {$\geq$}60~years were included. Two investigators independently conducted abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments. Authors were contacted for missing data. RESULTS: Once 787 records were screened, six cohort studies, one case-control study and five cross-sectional studies were included. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated a positive trend between higher magnesium intake and higher hip and femoral neck BMD. Meta-analysis of four studies showed a significant positive association between magnesium intake and hip BMD (pooled beta: 0.03, 95\% CI: 0.01-0.06, p~{$<~$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that a higher magnesium intake may support an increase in hip and femoral neck BMD. Due to limited research no associations with BMD at other sites or fractures were found. There is a need for properly designed cohort studies to determine the association between magnesium intake and bone health in older adults. Next, large and long-term randomized controlled trials in older adults are needed to determine whether an increase in magnesium (supplementation) intake can improve bone health. The combination of several bone nutrients (calcium, vitamin D, protein, magnesium and potentially more) may be needed for the most optimal effect on bone health and to delay or prevent the development of osteoporosis.},

This article reviews the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, diagnostic workup, novel pathophysiologic insights, and treatment of immunocompetent patients with primary CNS lymphoma.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The prognosis of primary CNS lymphoma has significantly improved over the past few decades because of the introduction of and widespread use of high-dose methotrexate, which is now the backbone of all first-line combination chemotherapy treatments. Despite this progress, durable remission is still observed in only approximately 50\% of patients. Novel insights into the pathophysiology of primary CNS lymphoma have identified the B-cell receptor pathway as well as the suppressed tumor immune microenvironment and immune evasion as key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of primary CNS lymphoma. Novel, small molecules and agents targeting these aberrant pathways have been introduced into clinical trials of recurrent/refractory primary CNS lymphomas. Agents such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib or immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide have shown promising response rates in the relapsed setting.                                         SUMMARY               Diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma requires a high level of suspicion because clinical signs and deficits can vary and depend on the involved CNS compartments. Rapid initiation of therapy is essential for recovery and prognosis. The optimal treatment regimen has not been defined, but methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens are considered the standard treatment approach for induction treatment. Novel, targeted agents have recently been introduced into the therapeutic arsenal.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The growing use of factor Xa inhibitors has increasingly caused patients with stroke to be excluded from treatment with IV thrombolysis. Important geographic, socioeconomic, sex, race, and ethnic disparities have been identified in the implementation of IV thrombolysis and need to be overcome. IV thrombolysis substantially improves outcomes when provided within the first golden hour after stroke onset in patients treated in mobile stroke units, supporting the ``time is brain'' concept and encouraging the possible value of more widespread implementation of the mobile stroke unit approach. At the same time, other studies have shown that IV thrombolysis can be successful in patients whose ``tissue clock'' is still ticking up to 9 hours after stroke onset or in patients who awaken with their stroke, as demonstrated by favorable imaging profiles. These considerations, along with the emergence of endovascular thrombectomy, have fostered examination of our care systems, including the ``drip and ship'' versus direct to comprehensive or endovascular thrombectomy stroke center approaches, as well as the possibility of skipping IV thrombolysis in certain patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy. Data suggesting that tenecteplase is at least noninferior to alteplase, as well as its more convenient dosing, has led to its increased use. Ongoing studies are evaluating newer thrombolytics and adding antithrombotic therapy to IV thrombolysis.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               IV thrombolysis remains the most common acute stroke treatment. Advances in acting faster to treat stroke have increased its efficacy, and advances in imaging have expanded its use. However, implementing these advances and overcoming disparities in IV thrombolysis use remain major challenges.},

  abstract = {Soccer injuries are a recognized problem worldwide. Several injury prevention programs have been confirmed to reduce the number of injuries in female and male players. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data about their cost, burden, and benefit for the health care system. In this paper we aim to systematically review the literature and critically evaluate the economic quality of injury prevention interventions implemented across different populations of soccer players. Web of Science, Medline, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, and other databases were searched from January 2011 through July 2021. Research articles were only selected for analysis if they focused on the cost-effectiveness of injury prevention, were experimental papers written in English, and were published following the peer-review process. Three cluster RCT and one retrospective study met the criteria. Cost data on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted. The included studies had a good/average quality of economic evaluation. Based on ICERs, injury prevention interventions were cost-effective in three out of the three comparisons. One study did not report the ICER value. However, since economic analyses were reported with varying methodological approaches and results, more data are required to recognize the cost-effectiveness of soccer-specific injury prevention interventions and their benefit for the health care system.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL) commonly occurs during sporting events. It causes pain, instability and reduction in range of movement of the knee which results in altered balance, reduced strength as well as loading to the involved knee. The challenge to get the patient back to competitive sports level much depends on the rehabilitation process. Post ACLR rehabilitation is challenging due to the long rehabilitation time as well as boring repetitive exercises. The aim of this study is to compare between the effectiveness of using immersive virtual reality (PlayStation VR) in addition to the conventional rehabilitation as an aid in rehabilitation of patients after ACLR in terms of objective functional assessment and pain and subjective knee function scoring. METHODS: This randomised controlled trial was undertaken in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia from July 2019 until July 2020. Thirty patients were randomised into a group undergoing purely conventional rehabilitation (Group 1) and a group undergoing both conventional rehabilitation and immersive virtual reality assisted rehabilitation (Group 2). The immersive virtual reality assisted rehabilitation was started at 3 months post operatively for 3 months duration. Limb loading, balance, range of motion, functional hop tests of the knee, pain and subjective scoring of the knee with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Scores were measured preoperatively and at 6 months. RESULTS: There were significant differences in terms of improvement of pain scores (p~=~0.012) as well as IKDC Scores (p~=~0.024) in Group 2 as compared to Group 1. However, there were no significant differences with regards to limb loading, balance, range of motion and functional hop tests of the knee (p~{$>~$}0.05). No adverse events were observed during the study period. CONCLUSION: Immersive virtual reality can be used as an adjunct in rehabilitation of patients after ACL reconstruction in terms of improving their pain as well as their subjective knee evaluation. Large randomised control trial is recommended to further investigate the efficacy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evidence comparing the effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is controversial. We sought to compare short-term and long-term effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment in sciatica symptom severity and quality of life in patients with lumbar disc herniation in a routine clinical setting. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of a routine clinical practice registry consisting of 370 patients. Outcome measures were the North American Spine Society questionnaire and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey to assess patient-reported back pain, physical function, neurogenic symptoms and quality of life. Primary outcomes were back pain at 6 and 12\>weeks. Standard open discectomy was assessed versus conservative interventions at 6, 12, 52 and 104\>weeks. We filled in missing outcome variable values with multiple imputation, accounted for repeated measures within patients with mixed-effects models and adjusted baseline group differences in relevant prognostic indicators by inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Surgical treatment patients reported less back pain at 6 weeks than those receiving conservative therapy (-0.97; 95\% CI -1.89 to -0.09), were more likely to report {$\geq$}50\% decrease in back pain symptoms from baseline to 6\>weeks (48\% vs 17\%, risk difference: 0.34; 95\% CI 0.16 to 0.47) and reported less physical function disability at 52\>weeks (-3.7; 95\% CI -7.4 to -0.1). The other assessments showed minimal between-group differences with CIs, including the null effect. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conservative therapy, surgical treatment provided faster relief from back pain symptoms in patients with lumbar disc herniation, but did not show a benefit over conservative treatment in midterm and long-term follow-up.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The suspicion that LEMS is rare but also likely underdiagnosed is supported by recent epidemiologic data. A validated, LEMS-specific scale now exists to assess and monitor disease, and symptomatic and immunomodulatory treatments are available. As presynaptic disorders of neuromuscular transmission, LEMS and botulism share electrodiagnostic abnormalities but have important distinguishing features. Knowledge of the clinical features of botulism is needed, particularly with continued cases of infant botulism, the opioid epidemic increasing the incidence of wound botulism, and medical use of botulinum toxin, which may cause iatrogenic botulism. Foodborne botulism remains rare. Prompt recognition of botulism and administration of antitoxin can improve outcomes. MG may be exacerbated or may present de novo in the context of immune activation from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies for cancer. Immune-related MG commonly overlaps with myositis and myocarditis. Corticosteroids typically result in improvement. However, immune-related MG can be more fulminant than its idiopathic counterpart and may cause permanent disability or death.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis of LEMS, botulism, or immune-related MG can generally be made from the patient's history, supplemented with directed questions, a physical examination designed to demonstrate abnormalities, and laboratory and electrodiagnostic testing. Early diagnosis and carefully selected treatment not only improve outcomes of the neuromuscular disease but can affect the prognosis of underlying malignancy, when present.},

In addition, the incidence of new and recurrent stroke is declining, likely because of the increased use of specific prevention medications, such as statins and antihypertensives. Despite these positive trends in incidence and mortality, many strokes remain preventable. The major modifiable risk factors are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and hyperlipidemia, as well as lifestyle factors, such as obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical inactivity. This article reviews the current recommendations for the management of each of these modifiable risk factors.                                         Recent Findings:               It has been documented that some blood pressure medications may increase variability of blood pressure and ultimately increase the risk for stroke. Stroke prevention typically includes antiplatelet therapy (unless an indication for anticoagulation exists), so the most recent evidence supporting use of these drugs is reviewed. In addition, emerging risk factors, such as obstructive sleep apnea, electronic cigarettes, and elevated lipoprotein (a), are discussed.                                         Summary:               Overall, secondary stroke prevention includes a multifactorial approach. This article incorporates evidence from guidelines and published studies and uses an illustrative case study throughout the article to provide examples of secondary prevention management of stroke risk factors.},

To simplify the approach to this category of patients, sensory-predominant polyneuropathies are divided broadly into either small fiber (or pain-predominant) neuropathies and large fiber (or ataxia-predominant) neuropathies, of which the sensory neuronopathies (dorsal root ganglionopathies) are highlighted.                                         Recent Findings:               Physicians can now easily perform skin biopsies in their offices, allowing access to the gold standard pathologic diagnostic tool for small fiber neuropathies. Additional diagnostic techniques, such as corneal confocal microscopy, are emerging. Recently, small fiber neuropathies have been associated with a broader spectrum of diseases, including fibromyalgia, sodium channel mutations, and voltage-gated potassium channel antibody autoimmune disease.                                         Summary:               Despite advances in diagnosing small fiber neuropathies and sensory neuronopathies, many of these neuropathies remain refractory to treatment. In select cases, early identification and treatment may result in better outcomes. ``Idiopathic'' should be a diagnosis of exclusion and a thorough investigation for treatable causes pursued.},

It allows players to dynamically formulate hypotheses from clinical case studies. Each 'Family' of cards represents a hypothesis category. The game highlights the missing information and trains players to consider it in their CR.This game should efficiently structure all components of CR and is an interesting resource for all teachers. Its greatest strength is that it can be used with other category frameworks. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and efficiency of such a tool and to measure students' actual progress in learning the CR.},

METHOD: A literature search was carried out in the PubMed database, with the search phrases "traumatic spinal cord injury"/"traumatic spinal cord injuries" together with "autonomic dysfunction", "autonomic dysreflexia" and "cardiovascular disease". RESULTS: The most important cardiovascular complications in the acute phase are bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, enhanced vasovagal reflexes, supraventricular/ventricular ectopic beats, vasodilation and venous stasis. Important in the chronic phase are orthostatic hypotension and impaired regulation of blood pressure, blood volume and body temperature. Tetraplegia is frequently accompanied by autonomic dysreflexia, impaired transmission of cardial pain, loss of muscle mass in the left ventricle and pseudoinfarction. Patients with injuries above the sixth thoracic vertebra have a predisposition for autonomic dysreflexia. This is a condition characterised by sudden, uncontrolled sympathetic response accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. Autonomic dysreflexia usually leads to headaches and erythema on the upper chest. The condition may cause cerebral haemorrhage and is potentially life threatening. Patients with spinal cord injuries have an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease due to overweight, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. They are predisposed to thrombotic emboli due to venous stasis and hypercoagulopathy, particularly immediately after the injury. INTERPRETATION: Knowledge of cardiovascular sequelae after spinal cord injuries and assessment of these is important for correct diagnostics, planning of preventive measures and optimal treatment.},

This article introduces readers to core concepts, as well as recent advances, in bedside and instrumented vestibular assessments. RECENT FINDINGS: Vestibular testing has improved immensely in the past 2 decades. While history and bedside testing is still the primary method of differential diagnosis in patients with dizziness, advances in technology such as the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test for superior canal dehiscence and the video head impulse test for vestibular neuritis have capabilities that go far beyond the bedside examination. Current vestibular testing now allows clinicians to test all five vestibular sensors in the inner ear. SUMMARY: Contemporary vestibular testing technology can now assess the entire vestibular periphery. Relatively subtle conditions, such as superior canal dehiscence or a subtle vestibular neuritis, can now be diagnosed with far greater certainty.},

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of early repair or nonoperative treatment of a concomitant medial collateral ligament injury on range of motion of the knee and quadriceps muscle strength in patients with combined injuries. METHODS: Forty-seven consecutive patients with combined anterior cruciate and grade-III medial collateral ligament injuries were randomized into two groups. The medial collateral ligament was repaired in Group I (n = 23) and was treated nonoperatively in Group II (n = 24). In both groups, the torn anterior cruciate ligament was treated with early reconstruction. The patients were evaluated on the basis of sequential range-of-motion measurements, the one-leg-hop test, and isokinetic muscle power measurements at the time of follow-up, and the findings were compared between the two treatment groups. RESULTS: All patients achieved full knee extension. At all follow-up intervals the flexion deficit was greater in the group that had been managed with surgical repair of both ligaments, but the difference was significant only at six weeks (100 degrees compared with 112 degrees; p = 0.009), twelve weeks (119 degrees compared with 128 degrees; p = 0.043), and thirty-six weeks (130 degrees compared with 136 degrees; p = 0.011) after the operation. The difference between the groups was not significant at fifty-two weeks (132 degrees compared with 137 degrees) or 104 weeks (134 degrees compared with 137 degrees). The quadriceps muscle power deficit at fifty-two weeks was 30.7\% in the group that had been managed with combined repair and 20.5\% in the group that had been managed with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction only (p = 0.015). At 104 weeks, the deficits were 14.4\% and 9.7\%, respectively (p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Early operative treatment of combined anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligament injuries is possible without increased long-term mobilization complications. The rehabilitation period is long, and aggressive physiotherapy is recommended. However, nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament allows faster restoration of flexion and quadriceps muscle power. Our results favor nonoperative treatment of the torn medial collateral ligament in patients with combined injuries.},

  abstract = {Background:               Uncompensated vestibular hypofunction can result in symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, and/or oscillopsia, gaze and gait instability, and impaired navigation and spatial orientation; thus, may negatively impact an individual's quality of life, ability to perform activities of daily living, drive, and work. It is estimated that one-third of adults in the United States have vestibular dysfunction and the incidence increases with age. There is strong evidence supporting vestibular physical therapy for reducing symptoms, improving gaze and postural stability, and improving function in individuals with vestibular hypofunction. The purpose of this revised clinical practice guideline is to improve quality of care and outcomes for individuals with acute, subacute, and chronic unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction by providing evidence-based recommendations regarding appropriate exercises.                                         Methods:               These guidelines are a revision of the 2016 guidelines and involved a systematic review of the literature published since 2015 through June 2020 across 6 databases. Article types included meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control series, and case series for human subjects, published in English. Sixty-seven articles were identified as relevant to this clinical practice guideline and critically appraised for level of evidence.                                         Results:               Based on strong evidence, clinicians should offer vestibular rehabilitation to adults with unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction who present with impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions related to the vestibular deficit. Based on strong evidence and a preponderance of harm over benefit, clinicians should not include voluntary saccadic or smooth-pursuit eye movements in isolation (ie, without head movement) to promote gaze stability. Based on moderate to strong evidence, clinicians may offer specific exercise techniques to target identified activity limitations and participation restrictions, including virtual reality or augmented sensory feedback. Based on strong evidence and in consideration of patient preference, clinicians should offer supervised vestibular rehabilitation. Based on moderate to weak evidence, clinicians may prescribe weekly clinic visits plus a home exercise program of gaze stabilization exercises consisting of a minimum of: (1) 3 times per day for a total of at least 12 minutes daily for individuals with acute/subacute unilateral vestibular hypofunction; (2) 3 to 5 times per day for a total of at least 20 minutes daily for 4 to 6 weeks for individuals with chronic unilateral vestibular hypofunction; (3) 3 to 5 times per day for a total of 20 to 40 minutes daily for approximately 5 to 7 weeks for individuals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Based on moderate evidence, clinicians may prescribe static and dynamic balance exercises for a minimum of 20 minutes daily for at least 4 to 6 weeks for individuals with chronic unilateral vestibular hypofunction and, based on expert opinion, for a minimum of 6 to 9 weeks for individuals with bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Based on moderate evidence, clinicians may use achievement of primary goals, resolution of symptoms, normalized balance and vestibular function, or plateau in progress as reasons for stopping therapy. Based on moderate to strong evidence, clinicians may evaluate factors, including time from onset of symptoms, comorbidities, cognitive function, and use of medication that could modify rehabilitation outcomes.                                         Discussion:               Recent evidence supports the original recommendations from the 2016 guidelines. There is strong evidence that vestibular physical therapy provides a clear and substantial benefit to individuals with unilateral and bilateral vestibular hypofunction.                                         Limitations:               The focus of the guideline was on peripheral vestibular hypofunction; thus, the recommendations of the guideline may not apply to individuals with central vestibular disorders. One criterion for study inclusion was that vestibular hypofunction was determined based on objective vestibular function tests. This guideline may not apply to individuals who report symptoms of dizziness, imbalance, and/or oscillopsia without a diagnosis of vestibular hypofunction.                                         Disclaimer:               These recommendations are intended as a guide to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for individuals undergoing vestibular physical therapy. The contents of this guideline were developed with support from the American Physical Therapy Association and the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy using a rigorous review process. The authors declared no conflict of interest and maintained editorial independence.

Although neuroborreliosis was first identified almost a century ago, much confusion remains about how to accurately diagnose this quite treatable nervous system infection. Well-established diagnostic tools and therapeutic regimens exist for neurosyphilis, which has been well-known for centuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Serologic testing targeting the C6 antigen may simplify diagnostic testing in neuroborreliosis while improving accuracy. Historically, screening for syphilis has used a reaginic test followed by a treponeme-specific assay; alternative approaches, including use of well-defined recombinant antigens, may improve sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. In neuroborreliosis, measurement of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF may provide a useful marker of disease activity in the central nervous system.                                         SUMMARY               Lyme disease causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculitis, and mononeuropathy multiplex. Cognitive symptoms, occurring either during (encephalopathy) or after infection (posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome) are rarely, if ever, due to central nervous system infection. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome is not antibiotic responsive. Syphilis causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, chronic meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, and parenchymal neurosyphilis. The organism remains highly sensitive to penicillin, but residua of chronic infection may be irreversible.},

The multisystem involvement and disease variability of myotonic dystrophy have presented challenges for clinical care and research. This article focuses on the diagnosis and management of the disease. In addition, recent advances in characterizing the diverse clinical manifestations and variability of the disease are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Studies of the multisystem involvement of myotonic dystrophy, including the most lethal cardiac and respiratory manifestations and their molecular underpinnings, expand our understanding of the myotonic dystrophy phenotype. Advances have been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of both types of myotonic dystrophy, providing opportunities for developing targeted therapeutics, some of which have entered clinical trials in DM1.

  abstract = {This article has been corrected. The original version (PDF) is appended to this article as a Supplement. BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence has continuously increased over the past few centuries and represents a major health burden worldwide. PURPOSE: To evaluate the possible causal relationship between intake of red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest from inception until July 2018 and MEDLINE from inception until April 2019 without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies that included more than 1000 adults and reported the association between consumption of unprocessed red and processed meat and cancer mortality and incidence. DATA EXTRACTION: Teams of 2 reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias; 1 reviewer evaluated the certainty of evidence, which was confirmed or revised by the senior reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 118 articles (56 cohorts) with more than 6 million participants, 73 articles were eligible for the dose-response meta-analyses, 30 addressed cancer mortality, and 80 reported cancer incidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that an intake reduction of 3 servings of unprocessed meat per week was associated with a very small reduction in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime. Evidence of low to very low certainty suggested that each intake reduction of 3 servings of processed meat per week was associated with very small decreases in overall cancer mortality over a lifetime; prostate cancer mortality; and incidence of esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancer. LIMITATION: Limited causal inferences due to residual confounding in observational studies, risk of bias due to limitations in diet assessment and adjustment for confounders, recall bias in dietary assessment, and insufficient data for planned subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: The possible absolute effects of red and processed meat consumption on cancer mortality and incidence are very small, and the certainty of evidence is low to very low.

RECENT FINDINGS               The principles underlying spinal cord lesion localization are well established, but improvements in MRI and the discovery of pathologic antibodies associated with causes of transverse myelitis distinct from multiple sclerosis, such as aquaporin-4 IgG and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG, have assisted in diagnosis.                                         SUMMARY               The spinal cord has a highly organized neuroanatomy of ascending and descending tracts that convey sensory, motor, and autonomic information. Using integration of clues from the patient's history and neurologic examination, the effective clinician can distinguish spinal cord from peripheral nerve or brain pathology, often determine the level and parts of the spinal cord affected by a lesion, and focus on a likely diagnosis. The advent of MRI of the spine has revolutionized investigation of spinal cord disorders, but an important place for strong clinical acumen still exists in assessing the patient with a myelopathy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gluteal insufficiency is a common and challenging complaint. New concepts in pathobiomechanics and improved clinical understanding of chronic gluteal dysfunction have unmasked gluteus medius (GMed) tears as an underlying cause of enhanced trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). These tears are often missed or misdiagnosed as bursitis, but lead to prolonged chronic peritrochanteric pain. Clinic: The clinical signs are often dull pain on the lateral hip aspect, reduced hip abduction strength with positive Trendelenburg testing and a tendency for the leg to external rotation, as the internal rotation strength is reduced. IMAGING: Radiography and ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis, whereas MRI is the modality of choice for imaging. Compensatory hypertrophy of the tensor fascia latae muscle (TFL) and fatty involution (especially of the GMed) are also seen. THERAPY: Conservative treatment regimens for partial thickness tears involve hip joint centering and strengthening of abductor muscles, sparing TFL. Failed conservative treatment and full thickness tears are treated surgically. Partial tears can be addressed endoscopically with suture anchors for tendon footprint reconstruction. Larger tears involving the anterior and/or lateral facets of the tendon or failed conservative treatment are repaired with minimally invasive open reduction techniques. Double row suture anchor techniques provide anatomical tendon footprint reconstruction. Postoperative rehabilitation is prolonged, due to high acting forces in the peritrochanteric region, and needs to be carried out under professional surveillance. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of gluteal tendon tears is often the only solution in the treatment of chronic hip pain due to gluteal insufficiency. Available data suggest that reduction in pain and restoration of abduction power can be achieved in mid-term follow-up.},

Dance therapy or complex motor activity, besides pharmacological treatment, may have benefits in PD patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of dance in patients with PD. METHODS: We searched for clinical trials in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, and Cochrane till April 2020 using relevant keywords. Data were extracted and pooled as mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) by Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 372 patients were included. Dance showed a significant improvement over the control group in term of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) after three (MD\,= -\,4.49, 95\% CI [-\,6.78,\,-\,2.21], p\,=\,0.00001), six, (MD\,=\,-\,5.96, 95\% CI [-\,8.89,\,-\,3.02], p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), and 12 months (MD\,=\,-\,14.58, 95\% CI [-\,24.76,\,-\,4.4], p\,=\,0.005), and Mini-BES test after 12 months. Compared to exercise, dance showed a significant improvement in Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Mini-BES test. CONCLUSION: In comparison to other types of exercise or no activity, dance improves the symptoms and outcomes in patients with PD, especially motor symptoms. Dance also has positive effects on balance, functional mobility, and cognition.},

Nutrients included in the analysis were beef, red meat, dietary protein, essential amino acids, branched chain amino acids, tryptophan, arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, zinc, and iron. We identified nine RCTs with results from 55 measurements of markers of wellbeing. An overall positive effect was found of beef and beef's nutrients on wellbeing. There was an overall positive effect of amino acids and protein on wellbeing, with no effect of arginine, vitamin B-12, leucine, and zinc. Physical function was also influenced by beef and nutrients found in beef. Eight of the studies found focused on specific nutrients found in beef, and not beef itself in older adults with one or more chronic diseases. This study identified a need for further research regarding the effect of beef and nutrients found in beef on defined functional outcomes of wellbeing in healthy adults {$\geq$}50~years of age.},

This article reviews various types of inherited myelopathies, with emphasis on hereditary spastic paraplegias and spastic ataxias.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The ever-growing number of myelopathy-causing genes and broadening of phenotype-genotype correlations makes the molecular diagnosis of inherited myelopathies a daunting task. This article emphasizes the main phenotypic clusters among inherited myelopathies that can facilitate the diagnostic process. This article focuses on newly identified genetic causes and the most important identifying clinical features that can aid the diagnosis, including the presence of a characteristic age of onset and additional neurologic signs such as leukodystrophy, thin corpus callosum, or amyotrophy.                                         SUMMARY               The exclusion of potentially treatable causes of myelopathy remains the most important diagnostic step. Syndromic diagnosis can be supported by molecular diagnosis, but the genetic diagnosis at present does not change the management. Moreover, a negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of a hereditary myelopathy because comprehensive molecular testing is not yet available, and many disease-causing genes remain unknown.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In vitro force and deformation measurements formed the basis for determinate, quasistatic analysis of principal forces in the seated lumbar spine. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between seated postures and the mechanical response in component tissues of lumbar intervertebral joints. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite the high prevalence of low back pain syndrome, the precise mechanisms relating specific mechanical loads to spinal degeneration are not well understood. Simultaneous, time-dependent measurement of anterior column forces and articular facet forces has not been presented previously. consequently, a determinate analysis of principal component forces has not been possible. METHODS: Twelve lumbar spines (L1-S1) were subjected to constant loading conditions while in flexed and extended seated postures. Time-dependent forces were measured in the anterior column at the L4 and L5 superior endplates and in the four facets of the L3-L4 and L4-L5 motion segments. A quasi-static analysis of sagittal plane forces was used to compute the remaining principal joint forces, including ligament, disc shear, and facet impingement forces. RESULTS: Component forces changed under static loading in both postures. There were significant differences between the mechanical responses of the two postures. Although the vertical creep displacement was greater in the extended seated posture (3.22 mm versus 2.11 mm), the escalation of forces was more severe in the flexed posture. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a mechanism of force balancing in lordotic postures under static loads, whereas flexed postures produce large increases to the tensile forces in the region of the posterior anulus.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in patients with musculoskeletal upper extremity problems being treated in physical therapy. BACKGROUND: The clinimetric properties of the PSFS have not been established nor compared with region-specific outcome measures in patients with upper extremity problems. METHODS: Patients completed the PSFS, Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI), and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) at baseline and follow-up, and were categorized as improved, stable, or worsened, using the global rating of change. Construct validity was assessed by comparing the change scores of the stable and improved groups, using independent-samples t tests. Reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1) with 95\% confidence intervals. Bland-Altman plots determined limits of agreement. Responsiveness and minimal important difference (MID) were determined with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: One hundred eighty patients met the inclusion criteria. Construct validity was supported for the PSFS and the UEFI (P{$<$}.001). Reliability was moderate to good for the PSFS (ICC2,1 = 0.713) and UEFI (ICC2,1 = 0.848). Reported estimates of reliability may be lower than true values because the group of "stable" patients from this cohort had, on average, a small positive change. Bland-Altman plots indicated good agreement. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was significantly different from the null value of 0.5 for the PSFS (0.887) and the UEFI (0.877), indicating good accuracy in distinguishing improved patients from stable patients. MID was 1.2 for the PSFS (scale, 0-10) and 8.5 for the UEFI (scale, 0-80). CONCLUSION: The PSFS is a valid, reliable, and responsive outcome measure for patients with upper extremity problems.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVES: To identify, analyze, and synthesize the literature to determine which physical examination tests, if any, accurately diagnose a torn tibial meniscus. BACKGROUND: Knee pain has a lifetime prevalence of up to 45\%, and as many as 31\% of individuals with knee pain will consult a general practitioner. Roughly 5\% of these individuals will undergo a tibial meniscectomy and many more will undergo partial meniscectomy or meniscus repair. Determining which of these individuals is appropriate for surgical consult depends on clinical examination findings. METHODS AND MEASURES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus from1966 to August 2006 and extracted all English- and German-language studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of individual physical examination tests for a torn meniscus. We retrieved data regarding true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives to create 2-by-2 tables for each article and test. Like tests were then subjected to meta-analysis and subanalysis. Cochran Q test and the 12 statistic were used to examine for the presence of heterogeneity and the extent of the effect of heterogeneity, respectively. A qualitative analysis was also performed using the QUADAS tool. RESULTS: Eighteen studies qualified for the final analyses. Three physical examination tests (McMurray's, Apley's, and joint line tenderness) were examined in more than 7 studies and had enough data to consider meta-analysis. However, study results were heterogeneous. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 70\% and 71\% for McMurray's, 60\% and 70\% for Apley's, and 63\% and 77\% for joint line tenderness. Large between-study differences could not be explained by prevalence, study quality, or how well an index test was described. CONCLUSIONS: No single physical examination test appears to accurately diagnose a torn tibial meniscus and the value of history plus physical examination is unknown. Differences between studies in diagnostic performance remain unexplained, presumably due to local differences in the way the tests are defined, performed, and interpreted. We recommend a more standardized approach to performing and interpreting these tests and the development of a clinical prediction rule to aid clinicians in the diagnosis of a torn tibial meniscus.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Patients with MG can be classified based on antibody status and their clinical presentation; treatment responses may differ based on disease subtypes. Improved diagnostic methods and recognition of new antigenic targets such as lipoprotein-related protein 4 have led to improved diagnostic efficiencies. Corticosteroids remain the first-line immunotherapy, but there is a trend toward minimizing their use at high doses and for long durations. Oral immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and tacrolimus remain useful. An international, multicenter randomized trial comparing thymectomy plus prednisone with prednisone alone demonstrated that thymectomy improves clinical outcomes in selected patients with nonthymomatous MG. Eculizumab, efgartigimod, and ravulizumab have recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with generalized MG who are acetylcholine receptor--antibody positive. These drugs take advantage of novel mechanisms of action and expand treatment options for patients with MG. Data on rituximab suggest that it can be a good option, especially for patients with MG who are positive for antibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). The number of clinical trials and drugs in development for MG is steadily increasing.                                         SUMMARY               The diagnosis of MG can generally be made from the patient's history, a neurologic examination, and laboratory and electrodiagnostic testing. Carefully selected treatment improves outcomes in MG. Additional treatment options for MG will likely be available in the near future.},

However, its clinimetric properties have not yet been evaluated in these patients. The study aimed to investigate the construct validity, test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, and feasibility of the PSFS in acutely hospitalized older patients with and without cognitive impairment (CI). METHODS: The clinimetric properties of the PSFS were investigated by secondary data analysis from a prospective observational cohort study examining physical activity and mobility in acutely hospitalized older patients. In this analysis, 120 older patients-83.0 (6.4) years-with and without CI (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 18-23, n = 52, and MMSE {$\geq$}24, n = 68, respectively) receiving early multidisciplinary geriatric rehabilitation in acute care were included. Construct validity was assessed by Spearman correlations (rs) with the Activity-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC-6), Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (Short FES-I), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI), and Barthel Index (BI); test-retest reliability within 24 hours by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs); sensitivity to change by standardized response means (SRMs) calculated for treatment effects, and feasibility by completion rates/times and floor/ceiling effects. RESULTS: The PSFS showed fair to moderate correlations with all construct variables in patients with CI (rs = 0.31 to 0.53). In patients without CI, correlations were fair for the ABC-6, FES-I, EQ-5D, and BI (rs = {\textbar}0.27 to 0.36{\textbar}), but low for the SPPB and DEMMI (rs =-0.04 to 0.14). Test-retest reliability (both: ICC = 0.76) and sensitivity to change (CI: SRM = 1.10, non-CI: SRM = 0.89) were excellent in both subgroups. Excellent feasibility was documented by high completion rates ({$>$}94\%), brief completion times ({$<$}8 min), and no floor/ceiling effects in either subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The PSFS has adequate clinimetric properties for assessing patient-specific functional limitations and changes in acutely hospitalized older patients with and without CI. It might be an appropriate complement to traditional functional scales to enhance patient-centeredness in clinical geriatric assessment.},

This article reviews these processes and the underlying neuroanatomy and provides an approach to the assessment of prefrontal lobe functions at the bedside.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive and behavioral frontal lobe functions are mediated by the prefrontal regions rather than the frontal lobes as a whole. At least five separate prefrontal functions have been defined: energization, task setting, monitoring, behavioral/emotional regulation, and metacognition. Energization is mediated by the superior medial prefrontal cortices bilaterally, task setting by the left lateral frontal cortex, monitoring by the right lateral prefrontal cortex, behavioral/emotional regulation by the orbitofrontal cortex, and metacognition by the frontal poles. Only task setting and monitoring are considered executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Distinct cognitive and behavioral processes are mediated by different parts of the frontal lobe. Lesions in these areas result in characteristic clinical deficits that are discussed in this article. Key messages are that prefrontal regions mediate the higher cortical functions (as opposed to the frontal lobes in general) and that prefrontal functions are not equivalent to executive functions.},

The anatomy and function of the so-called trigeminothalamic tracts have been investigated before. In these animal-based studies from the previous century, the intracerebral pathways were mapped using different retro- and anterograde tracing methods. We review the literature on the trigeminothalamic tracts focusing on these animal tracer studies. Subsequently, we related the observations of these studies to clinical findings using fMRI trials. The intracerebral trigeminal pathways can be subdivided into three pathways: a ventral (contralateral) and dorsal (mainly ipsilateral) trigeminothalamic tract and the intranuclear pathway. Based on the reviewed evidence we hypothesize the co-existence of an ipsilateral nociceptive conduction tract to the cerebral cortex and we translate evidence from animal-based research to the human anatomy. Our hypothesis differs from the classical idea that orofacial pain arises only from nociceptive information via the contralateral, ventral trigeminothalamic pathway. Better understanding of the histology, anatomy and connectivity of the trigeminal fibers could contribute to the discovery of a more effective pain treatment in patients suffering from various orofacial pain syndromes.},

Recent Findings:               Entrapment neuropathies are a common issue in general neurology practice. Early diagnosis and effective management of entrapment mononeuropathies are essential in preserving limb function and maintaining patient quality of life. Median neuropathy at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome), ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, radial neuropathy at the spiral groove, and fibular neuropathy at the fibular head are among the most frequently encountered entrapment mononeuropathies. Electrodiagnostic studies and peripheral nerve ultrasound are employed to help confirm the clinical diagnosis of nerve compression or entrapment and to provide precise localization for nerve injury. Peripheral nerve ultrasound demonstrates nerve enlargement at or near sites of compression.                                         Summary:               Entrapment neuropathies are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and effective management require knowledge of peripheral neuroanatomy and recognition of key clinical symptoms and findings. Clinical diagnoses may be confirmed by diagnostic testing with electrodiagnostic studies and peripheral nerve ultrasound.},

  abstract = {Medial epicondyle apophysitis (MEA), also known as little league elbow, is an overuse injury prevalent among adolescent athletes whose sport involves repetitive overhand throwing, racket use, or other overhead arm motions. The medial epicondyle is a bony protrusion on the medial elbow with its own ossification center, separate from the main distal humeral physis, known as an apophysis. This growth center at the medial epicondyle develops around 6-7 years of age and typically fuses by age 15.~The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and the flexor-pronator muscle groups originate at the medial epicondyle and serve to stabilize the elbow against valgus stress.~ Medial epicondyle apophysitis occurs due to excessive and repetitive valgus stress placed on the apophysis before its closure. Over time, the repetitive strain results in a traction-type injury and may cause pathologic widening and inflammation of the apophysis or even an avulsion fracture.~MEA may~cause significant morbidity in young athletes, who must temporarily refrain from their chosen sport until the pain improves and healing occurs. Proper prevention, identification, and prompt treatment of MEA can allow young adolescents to continue in the sports they enjoy without prolonged interruptions in their athletic seasons.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Literature regarding surfing injuries is scarce and most studies report a high number of minor injuries. Recent literature suggests that musculoskeletal injuries are more common than previously reported. In the mid 2000s, competitive surfing has seen an increase in aerial maneuvers, as they have become more highly rewarded by the judging panel, which may be contributing to a change in injury patterns. Our goal was to evaluate orthopedic injuries in professional surfers. HYPOTHESIS: Orthopedic injuries in professional surfers are diverse and have evolved with skill and technology. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 Case Series. METHODS: Medical records of professional surfers from a single orthopedic center between 1991 and 2016 were reviewed. Injuries sustained while surfing and chronic injuries related to surfing were included. Site of injury, diagnosis, and treatment were recorded along with demographic data. RESULTS: In total, 163 injuries in 86 athletes were recorded. The median injury age was 28.5 years (range 12-62 years) and 92.6\% of patients were male. The most frequently injured body parts were the knee (28.2\%), ankle (22.1\%), and shoulder (19\%). Most knee injuries were of the medial collateral ligament at 49\%, with 75\% of ankle injuries being sprains, and in shoulder, 48\% had instability, 42\% had a rotator cuff tear, and 35\% had a superior anterior-posterior labral tear. Lower extremity injuries primarily affected the surfers' back leg (72.5\%). In all, 34.6\% of all injuries required surgical intervention and involved shoulder injuries most the time. CONCLUSIONS: The most common orthopedic injuries in professional surfers involve the knee, ankle, shoulder, hip, and back. Surfers' rear extremities were preferentially injured which is the extremity responsible for power and torque. Shoulder injuries increased the probability of an operative intervention. Last, overuse injuries (femoral-acetabular impingement, rotator cuffs) occurred in the older surf population compared with more acute injuries (ankle sprains/fractures, anterior cruciate ligament tears) which is also consistent with time to surgery.},

  abstract = {Multiligamentous knee injuries (MLKI) are rare but devastating injuries that have a potential to cause long-term sequelae and significant morbidity. Frequently occurring concomitantly with knee dislocations (KD), MLKI have many risk factors that influence their incidence and treatment outcomes. Proper understanding of these risk factors can assist the surgeon with evaluation, surgical planning, and managing patient expectations both pre- and postoperatively. The purpose of this review is fourfold: (1) identify the risk factors and injuries associated with MLKI, (2) describe factors implicated in the treatment of MLKI, (3) report the effect of these risk factors on outcomes of MLKI, and (4) provide a brief insight into MLKI at our tertiary referral academic care center. This was a retrospective review of literature relevant to MLKI. Studies that described injuries, risk factors, treatment techniques, or outcomes associated with MLKI were included in our review. A total of 35 studies (consisting of level 3 and 4 evidence) published between 2009 and 2020 were found and included in our analysis. In addition, 25 patients who underwent treatment for MLKI at the University of Chicago Medical Center between December 2015 and December 2019 were included in our analysis. MLKI tend to occur in the younger male population. Increasing age, body mass index, and severity of the injury have been correlated with worse functional and patient-reported outcomes. Operative treatment is indicated for MLKI; however, timing and repair versus reconstruction is still debated, and is often decided on a patient by patient basis. Retrospective cohort studies have indicated that reconstruction may be favored; however, further more rigorous studies are needed to better characterize this finding. MLKIs are devastating injuries with significant variability in presentation, treatment, and outcome. Variations in these are largely attributable to the mechanism and severity of injury, timing, and surgeon preference. A holistic approach, and understanding of the present literature, is required to best optimize patient outcome.},

  abstract = {The principle of inverse effectiveness (PoIE) in multisensory integration states that, as the responsiveness to individual sensory stimuli decreases, the strength of multisensory integration increases. I discuss three potential problems in the analysis of multisensory data with regard to the PoIE. First, due to 'regression towards the mean,' the PoIE may often be observed in datasets that are analysed post-hoc (i.e., when sorting the data by the unisensory responses). The solution is to design discrete levels of stimulus intensity a priori. Second, due to neurophysiological or methodological constraints on responsiveness, the PoIE may be, in part, a consequence of 'floor' and 'ceiling' effects. The solution is to avoid analysing or interpreting data that are too close to the limits of responsiveness, enabling both enhancement and suppression to be reliably observed. Third, the choice of units of measurement may affect whether the PoIE is observed in a given dataset. Both relative (\%) and absolute (raw) measurements have advantages, but the interpretation of both is affected by systematic changes in response variability with changes in response mean, an issue that may be addressed by using measures of discriminability or effect-size such as Cohen's d. Most importantly, randomising or permuting a dataset to construct a null distribution of a test parameter may best indicate whether any observed inverse effectiveness specifically characterises multisensory integration. When these considerations are taken into account, the PoIE may disappear or even reverse in a given dataset. I conclude that caution should be exercised when interpreting data that appear to follow the PoIE.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the reliability and diagnostic accuracy of typical dermatomes and myotomes for determining the pathologic level in surgically verified patients with cervical radiculopathy. METHODS: Patients who underwent single-level surgery due to cervical radiculopathy with at least a 60\% reduction in preoperative symptoms or recovery of muscle power after surgery were included. The observed clinical symptoms (pain, paresthesia, motor weakness) were compared to those of typical cervical dermatomes and myotomes. RESULTS: Among the 227 patients reviewed, 142 (62.6\%) had a standard dermatomal pattern, and 74 of 110 (67.3\%) had a standard myotomal pattern. The myotome of C5/6 radiculopathy showed much more variance than those of other cervical segments. Among the patients with severe motor weakness (muscle strength {$\leq$} grade 3 or obvious muscle atrophy), all those with involvement of root C5, C7, and C8 showed a typical pattern (C4/5: 13 of 13 patients, C6/7: 5 of 5 patients, C7/T1: 3 of 3 patients), while only 2 of the 6 patients (33.3\%) with severe motor weakness caused by C5/6 radiculopathy fit the typical pattern. CONCLUSION: Among various symptoms, cervical myotome is of great value in determining the pathological level. However, it should be noted that there is high variability in human dermatomes and myotomes, especially for motor weakness due to C6 root compression, which is more variable than others.},

Investigators have categorized this condition as vascular versus neurogenic, where vascular TOS can be subcategorized as either arterial or venous and neurogenic TOS can subcategorized as either true or disputed. The thoracic outlet anatomical container presents with several key regional components, each capable of compromising the neurovascular structures coursing within. Bony and soft tissue abnormalities, along with mechanical dysfunctions, may contribute to neurovascular compromise. Diagnosing TOS can be challenging because the symptoms vary greatly amongst patients with the disorder, thus lending to other conditions including a double crush syndrome. A careful history and thorough clinical examination are the most important components in establishing the diagnosis of TOS. Specific clinical tests, whose accuracy has been documented, can be used to support a clinical diagnosis, especially when a cluster of positive tests are witnessed.},

OBJECTIVE: Part 2 of this review focuses on management of TOS. CONCLUSION: The clinician uses clinical examination results to design a rehabilitation program that focuses on correcting specific problems that were previously identified. Disputed neurogenic TOS is best managed with a trial of conservative therapy before surgical treatment options are considered. Cases that are resistant to conservative treatment may require surgical intervention. True neurogenic TOS may require surgical intervention to relieve compression of the neural structures in the thoracic outlet. Surgical management is required for cases of vascular TOS because of the potentially serious complications that may arise from venous or arterial compromise. Post-operative rehabilitation is recommended after surgical decompression to address factors that could lead to a reoccurrence of the patient's symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background:               Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.                                         Methods:               A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be available and can provide greater benefit.                                         Results:               Strong evidence indicates that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or virtual reality--based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual reality--based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight--supported treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance.                                         Discussion:               The collective findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy.                                         Limitations:               As walking speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of walking training may require substantial physical assistance.                                         Summary:               The guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and subacute stages following injury.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize peer-reviewed literature on the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and to identify its use as an outcome measure. METHODS: Searches were performed of several electronic databases from 1995 to May 2010. Studies included were published articles containing (1) primary research investigating the psychometric and clinimetrics of the PSFS or (2) the implementation of the PSFS as an outcome measure. We assessed the methodological quality of studies included in the first category. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-two articles published from 1994 to May 2010 were identified. Of these, 66 met the inclusion criteria for this review, with 13 reporting the measurement properties of the PSFS, 55 implementing the PSFS as an outcome measure, and 2 doing both of the above. The PSFS was reported to be valid, reliable, and responsive in populations with knee dysfunction, cervical radiculopathy, acute low back pain, mechanical low back pain, and neck dysfunction. The PSFS was found to be reliable and responsive in populations with chronic low back pain. The PSFS was also reported to be valid, reliable, or responsive in individuals with a limited number of acute, subacute, and chronic conditions. This review found that the PSFS is also being used as an outcome measure in many other conditions, despite a lack of published evidence supporting its validity in these conditions. CONCLUSION: Although the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure is increasing in physiotherapy practice, there are gaps in the research literature regarding its validity, reliability, and responsiveness in many health conditions.},

  abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effect of reducing dietary fiber on patients with idiopathic constipation. METHODS: Sixty-three cases of idiopathic constipation presenting between May 2008 and May 2010 were enrolled into the study after colonoscopy excluded an organic cause of the constipation. Patients with previous colon surgery or a medical cause of their constipation were excluded. All patients were given an explanation on the role of fiber in the gastrointestinal tract. They were then asked to go on a no fiber diet for 2 wk. Thereafter, they were asked to reduce the amount of dietary fiber intake to a level that they found acceptable. Dietary fiber intake, symptoms of constipation, difficulty in evacuation of stools, anal bleeding, abdominal bloating or abdominal pain were recorded at 1 and 6 mo. RESULTS: The median age of the patients (16 male, 47 female) was 47 years (range, 20-80 years). At 6 mo, 41 patients remained on a no fiber diet, 16 on a reduced fiber diet, and 6 resumed their high fiber diet for religious or personal reasons. Patients who stopped or reduced dietary fiber had significant improvement in their symptoms while those who continued on a high fiber diet had no change. Of those who stopped fiber completely, the bowel frequency increased from one motion in 3.75 d ({\textpm} 1.59 d) to one motion in 1.0 d ({\textpm} 0.0 d) (P {$<$} 0.001); those with reduced fiber intake had increased bowel frequency from a mean of one motion per 4.19 d ({\textpm} 2.09 d) to one motion per 1.9 d ({\textpm} 1.21 d) on a reduced fiber diet (P {$<$} 0.001); those who remained on a high fiber diet continued to have a mean of one motion per 6.83 d ({\textpm} 1.03 d) before and after consultation. For no fiber, reduced fiber and high fiber groups, respectively, symptoms of bloating were present in 0\%, 31.3\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001) and straining to pass stools occurred in 0\%, 43.8\% and 100\% (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Idiopathic constipation and its associated symptoms can be effectively reduced by stopping or even lowering the intake of dietary fiber.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A variety of instabilities are grouped under multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder. This makes understanding its diagnostic process, presentation and treatment difficult due to lack of evidence-based consensus. This review aims to propose a novel classification for subtypes of MDI. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on PubMed Medline and Embase. A combination of the following 'MeSH' and 'non-MesH' search terms were used: (1) Glenohumeral joint[tiab] OR Glenohumeral[tiab] OR Shoulder[tiab] OR Shoulder joint[tiab] OR Shoulder[MeSH] OR Shoulder joint[MeSH], (2) Multidirectional[tiab], (3) Instability[tiab] OR Joint instability[MeSH]. Sixty-eight publications which met our criteria were included. RESULTS: There was a high degree of heterogeneity in the definition of MDI. Thirty-one studies (46\%) included a trauma etiology in the definition, while 23 studies (34\%) did not. Twenty-five studies (37\%) excluded patients with labral or bony injuries. Only 15 (22\%) studies defined MDI as a global instability (instability in all directions), while 28 (41\%) studies considered MDI to be instability in two directions, of which one had to include the inferior direction. Six (9\%) studies included the presence of global ligamentous laxity as part of the definition. To improve scientific accuracy, the authors propose a novel AB classification which considers traumatic etiology and the presence of hyperlaxity when subdividing MDI. CONCLUSION: MDI is defined as symptomatic instability of the shoulder joint in two or more directions. A comprehensive classification system that considers predisposing trauma and the presence of hyperlaxity can provide a more precise assessment of the various existing subtypes of MDI.

  abstract = {This review will provide a comprehensive, up-to-date review of the current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of muscle contractures in cerebral palsy. Although much has been known about the clinical manifestations of both dynamic and static muscle contractures, until recently, little was known about the underlying mechanisms for the development of such contractures. In particular, recent basic science and imaging studies have reported an upregulation of collagen content associated with muscle stiffness. Paradoxically, contractile elements such as myofibrils have been found to be highly elastic, possibly an adaptation to a muscle that is under significant               in vivo               tension. Sarcomeres have also been reported to be excessively long, likely responsible for the poor force generating capacity and underlying weakness seen in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Overall muscle volume and length have been found to be decreased in CP, likely secondary to abnormalities in sarcomerogenesis. Recent animal and clinical work has suggested that the use of botulinum toxin for spasticity management has been shown to increase muscle atrophy and fibrofatty content in the CP muscle. Given that the CP muscle is short and small already, this calls into question the use of such agents for spasticity management given the functional and histological cost of such interventions. Recent theories involving muscle homeostasis, epigenetic mechanisms, and inflammatory mediators of regulation have added to our emerging understanding of this complicated area.},

METHOD: We conducted a manual search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, with a search deadline set for February 1, 2023. Data analysis was performed using Stata version 15.0. RESULT: A total of 9 randomized controlled studies were included, involving a total of 316 people, including 159 mesenchymal stem cells and 147 control groups. Results of meta-analysis: Compared to a placebo group, the administration of mesenchymal stem cells resulted in a significant reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores among patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke [SMD=-0.99,95\% CI (-1.93, -0.05)]. Compared to placebo, barthel index [SMD\,=\,0.48,95\% CI (-0.55,1.51)], modified rankin score [SMD\,=\,0.45, 95\% CI (1.11, 0.21)], adverse events (RR\,=\,0.68, 95\% CI (0.40, 1.17)] the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Based on current studies, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can ameliorate neurological deficits in patients with ischemic stroke to a certain extent without increasing adverse reactions. However, there was no significant effect on Barthel index and Modified Rankin score.},

Recent Findings:               Meta-analysis of the trials for endovascular treatment of acute stroke shows no significant increase in hemorrhagic events. Rehabilitation guidelines published by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association in 2016 aid in providing the best clinical practice for patients with stroke, from the time of their initial hospitalization to their return to the community.                                         Summary:               Medical complications from stroke are common and are associated with poor clinical outcomes, increased length of hospital stays and higher rates of readmission, increased cost of care, delayed time to rehabilitation, and increased mortality. Being cognizant of the common complications encountered, taking appropriate measures to prevent them, and knowing how to manage them when they do occur are essential to the continued care of patients with stroke.},

Thus, the objectives of this review are: to describe the inter-relationship between micronutrients, energy metabolism and well-being; identify risk groups for inadequate micronutrient intake; and explore the role of micronutrient supplementation in these groups. A review of the literature identified an important group at risk of inadequate micronutrient intake: young adults, often women, with a demanding lifestyle who are physically active and whose dietary behaviour is characterized by poor choices and/or regular dieting. Micronutrient supplementation can alleviate deficiencies, but supplements must be taken for an adequate period of time.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Next-generation (exome- and genome-based) sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the identification of single-gene causes of epileptic encephalopathy but have only had a modest impact on patient-specific treatment decisions. The treatment of most forms of epileptic encephalopathy remains a particularly challenging endeavor, with therapeutic decisions chiefly driven by the electroclinical syndrome classification. Most antiseizure drugs are ineffective in the treatment of these disorders, and treatments that are effective often entail significant risk and cost.

The mechanical behaviour of this "new" structure is still poorly understood and hotly debated in current literature. Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is one of the leading causes of lateral knee pain injuries in runners. We currently lack a comprehensive understanding of the healthy behaviour of the ITB, and this is necessary prior to further investigating the aetiology of pathologies like ITBS. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review was to collate the anatomical, biomechanical and clinical literature to understand how the mechanical function of the ITB is influenced by anatomical variation, posture and muscle activation. The complexity of understanding the mechanical function of the ITB is due, in part, to the presence of its two in-series muscles: gluteus maximus (GMAX) and tensor fascia latae (TFL). At present, we lack a fundamental understanding of how GMAX and TFL transmit force through the ITB and what mechanical role the ITB plays for movements like walking or running. While there is a range of proposed ITBS treatment strategies, robust evidence for effective treatments is still lacking. Interventions that directly target the running biomechanics suspected to increase either ITB strain or compression of lateral knee structures may have promise, but clinical randomised controlled trials are still required.},

In addition, chronic pain is reaching pandemic proportions and it is now well known that people living with chronic pain have a reduced life expectancy. To address and to prevent the growth of this public health disaster, we must start looking beyond adulthood. How children view pain has an impact on their behavioral coping responses which in turn predict persistent pain early in the lifespan. In addition, children who suffer from chronic pain and who are not (properly) treated for it before adolescence have an increased risk of having chronic pain during their adult life. Explaining pain to children and youth may have a tremendous impact not only on the individual child suffering from chronic pain but also on society, since the key to stop the pain pandemic may well lie in the first two decades of life. In order to facilitate the acquisition of adaptive behavioral coping responses, pain education aims to shift people's view on pain from being an apparent threat towards being a compelling perceptual experience generated by the brain that will only arise whenever the conceivable proof of danger to the body is greater than the conceivable proof of safety to the body. Nowadays a lot of pain education material is available for adults, but it is not adapted to children's developmental stage and therefore little or not suitable for them. An overview of the state-of-the-art pain education material for children and youth is provided here, along with its current and future areas of application as well as challenges to its development and delivery. Research on pediatric pain education is still in its infancy and many questions remain to be answered within this emerging field of investigation.},

Not only is chronic respiratory disease a leading cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality, but the COVID-19 pandemic has~heightened attention on respiratory health and the means of enhancing it. Subsequently, and inevitably, the respiratory system has become a target of the multi-trillion-dollar health and wellness industry. Numerous commercial, respiratory-related interventions are now coupled to therapeutic and/or ergogenic claims that vary in their plausibility: from the reasonable to the absurd. Moreover, legitimate and illegitimate claims are often conflated in a wellness space that lacks regulation. The abundance of interventions, the range of potential therapeutic targets in the respiratory system, and the wealth of research that varies in quality, all confound the ability for health and exercise professionals to make informed risk-to-benefit assessments with their patients and clients. This review focuses on numerous commercial interventions that purport to improve respiratory health, including nasal dilators, nasal breathing, and systematized breathing interventions (such as pursed-lips breathing), respiratory muscle training, canned oxygen, nutritional supplements, and inhaled L-menthol. For each intervention we describe the premise, examine the plausibility, and systematically contrast commercial claims against the published literature. The overarching aim is to assist health and exercise professionals to distinguish science from pseudoscience and make pragmatic and safe risk-to-benefit decisions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the muscle activity of patients with multidirectional instability treated in a conservative or complex manner (capsular shift with postoperative rehabilitation) and the muscle activity of stable shoulder joints before and after treatment during pull, push, and elevation of upper extremities and during overhead throw. SCOPE: The study was carried out on 34 patients with multidirectional shoulder instability treated non-operatively, on 31 patients with multidirectional shoulder instability treated operatively, and on 50 healthy subjects. Signals were recorded by surface EMG from eight different muscles. The mean and standard deviation of the maximum amplitude of normalized voluntary electrical activity for the different movement types and time broadness values during overhead throw were determined for each muscle in all groups and compared with each other. CONCLUSION: The centralization of the glenohumeral joint and the reduction of instability is attempted to be ensured by the organism through increasing the role of rotator cuff muscles (p=0.009) and decreasing the role of the deltoid, biceps brachii, and pectoralis maior muscles (p=0.007). At patients after short-term and long-term conservative treatment, the maximum amplitude of normalized voluntary electrical activity of stabilizer muscles is significantly higher (p=0.006), and that of accelerator muscles is significantly lower (p=0.005) and the time broadness is significantly longer (p=0.01) than that of the control group. At patients after complex treatment (open capsular shift with postoperative conservative rehabilitation) the characteristic of the muscle pattern is similar (p=0.19) to the control group. The complex treatment resolves the labral ligamentous abnormalities by operative treatment and restores the impaired muscular control by postoperative rehabilitation, whereas the conservative treatment restores only the muscular control.},

  abstract = {The current focus of medicine on molecular genetics ignores the physical basis of disease even though many of the problems that lead to pain and morbidity, and bring patients to the doctor's office, result from changes in tissue structure or mechanics. The main goal of this article is therefore to help integrate mechanics into our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. This article first reviews the key roles that physical forces, extracellular matrix and cell structure play in the control of normal development, as well as in the maintenance of tissue form and function. Recent insights into cellular mechanotransduction--the molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to mechanical stress--also are described. Re-evaluation of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that a wide range of diseases included within virtually all fields of medicine and surgery share a common feature: their etiology or clinical presentation results from abnormal mechanotransduction. This process may be altered by changes in cell mechanics, variations in extracellular matrix structure, or by deregulation of the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical signals and convert them into a chemical or electrical response. Molecules that mediate mechanotransduction, including extracellular matrix molecules, transmembrane integrin receptors, cytoskeletal structures and associated signal transduction components, may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases. Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation also may lead to development of improved medical devices, engineered tissues, and biologically-inspired materials for tissue repair and reconstruction.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This review on micrographia aims to draw the clinician's attention to non-Parkinsonian etiologies, provide clues to differential diagnosis, and summarize current knowledge on the phenomenology, etiology, and mechanisms underlying micrographia. METHODS: A systematic review of the existing literature was performed. RESULTS: Micrographia, namely small sized handwriting has long been attributed to Parkinson's disease. However, it has often been observed as part of the clinical picture of additional neurodegenerative disorders, sometimes antedating the motor signs, or following focal basal ganglia lesions without any accompanying parkinsonism, suggesting that bradykinesia and rigidity are not sine-qua-non for the development of this phenomenon. Therefore, micrographia in a patient with no signs of parkinsonism may prompt the clinician to perform imaging in order to exclude a focal basal ganglia lesion. Dopaminergic etiology in this and other cases is doubtful, since levodopa ameliorates letter stroke size only partially, and only in some patients. Parkinsonian handwriting is often characterized by lack of fluency, slowness, and less frequently by micrographia. Deviations from kinematic laws of motion that govern normal movement, including the lack of movement smoothness and inability to scale movement amplitude to the desired size, may reflect impairments in motion planning, possible loss of automaticity and reduced movement vigor. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology, neuroanatomy, mechanisms and models of micrographia are discussed. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia circuitry induced by neurodegeneration or disruption by focal damage give rise to micrographia.},

Although previous research has demonstrated reliability and validity of the form, its responsiveness has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to determine responsiveness of the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Patients who participated in the original validation study for the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form completed the form and a 7-level global rating of change scale that ranged from greatly worse to greatly better after a mean of 1.6 years (range, 0.5-2.3 years). Analyses included calculation of the standardized response mean and mean change in International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form score compared to the patient's perception of change on the global rating of change scale. In addition, a receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to determine the change in score that best distinguished patients who improved from those who did not. RESULTS: The overall standardized response mean was 0.94, which is considered large. With the exception of those who were slightly worse or unchanged, the mean change in the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form score compared to the patients' perceived global ratings of change was as expected (greatly worse, -15.1; somewhat worse, -8.4; slightly worse, 20.6; no change, 10.7; slightly better, 5.9; somewhat better, 18.1; greatly better, 38.7). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a change score of 11.5 points had the highest sensitivity, and a change score of 20.5 points had the highest specificity to distinguish between those who were or were not improved. CONCLUSION: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form is a responsive measure of symptoms, function, and sports activity for patients with a variety of knee conditions.},

  abstract = {We studied the contributions of the long and short heads of the biceps (LHB, SHB) to anterior stability in 13 cadaver shoulders. The LHB and SHB were replaced by spring devices and translation tests at 90 degrees abduction of the arm were performed by applying a 1.5 kg anterior force. The position of the humeral head was monitored by an electromagnetic tracking device with or without an anterior translational force; with 0 kg, 1.5 kg or 3 kg loads applied on either LHB or SHB tendons in 60 degrees, 90 degrees or 120 degrees of external rotation; and with the capsule intact, vented, or damaged by a Bankart lesion. The anterior displacement of the humeral head under 1.5 kg force was significantly decreased by both the LHB and SHB loading in all capsular conditions when the arm was in 60 degrees or 90 degrees of external rotation. At 120 degrees of external rotation, anterior displacement was significantly decreased by LHB and SHB loading only when there was a Bankart lesion. We conclude that LHB and SHB have similar functions as anterior stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint with the arm in abduction and external rotation, and that their role increases as shoulder stability decreases. Both heads of the biceps have been shown to have a stabilising function in resisting anterior head displacement, and consideration should therefore be given to strengthening the biceps during rehabilitation programmes for chronic anterior instability of the shoulder.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The diagnosis and management of hyponatremia continue to evolve. Diagnostic accuracy is improved by assessing serum and urine osmolality as well as urinary sodium. Avoiding overcorrection of hyponatremia is crucial to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome, although even careful correction can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome in patients who have other risk factors. The clinical presentation of osmotic demyelination syndrome has expanded, with many patients presenting with extrapontine myelinolysis in addition to central pontine myelinolysis.                                         SUMMARY               Electrolyte disorders often present with neurologic manifestations. Whereas disorders of some electrolytes, such as sodium, preferentially affect the central nervous system, disorders of others, such as potassium and calcium, have significant neuromuscular manifestations. An understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders and recognition of these manifestations are crucial for the practicing neurologist as the symptoms are reversible with correct management.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The medicinal treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) is mostly symptomatic to relieve pain and incapacity with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), drugs with well-known risks. Complementary medicines might reduce the symptoms of OA and decrease the need for NSAIDs. This study tested the effects of a food supplement, Phytalgic, on pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis and their use of analgesic and NSAIDs. METHODS: A randomized double-blind parallel-groups clinical trial compared Phytalgic (fish-oil, vitamin E, Urtica dioica) to a placebo for three months, in 81 patients with OA of the knee or hip using NSAIDs and/or analgesics regularly. The main outcome measures were use of NSAIDs (in Defined Daily Doses per day - DDD/day) or analgesics (in 500 mg paracetamol-equivalent tablets per week (PET/week) measured each month, and Western Ontario-McMaster University Osteo-Arthritis Index (WOMAC) function scales. RESULTS: After three months of treatment, the mean use of analgesics in the active arm (6.5 PET/week) vs. the placebo arm (16.5) was significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with a group mean difference of -10.0 (95\% CI: -4.9 to -15.1).

Mean WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness and function in the active arm (respectively 86.5, 41.4 and 301.6) vs the placebo arm (resp. 235.3, 96.3 and 746.5) were significantly different (P {$<$} 0.001) with group mean differences respectively of -148.8 (95\% CI: -97.7 to -199.9), -54.9 (95\% CI: -27.9 to -81.9) and -444.8 (95\% CI: -269.1 to -620.4).

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is a common overuse injury in runners with parallels to our findings of overuse in Greco Roman wrestlers. Despite research indicating coordination and movement-based factors about the hip, no studies were found using functional motor control (FMC) in runners or wrestlers with ITBS. Thus, we compared FMC exercises and therapeutic exercises (TEs) on pain, function, muscle strength, and range of motion (ROM) in national-level Greco Roman wrestlers with ITBS. DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Sixty national-level Greco Roman wrestlers diagnosed with ITBS were randomly assigned to 8~weeks of FMC exercises, TE, and a control group (20 individuals for each group). Pain (visual analog scale), function (triple hop test for distance, single-leg vertical jump test, and agility T test), muscle strength (handheld dynamometer), and ROM (goniometer) were measured at baseline and 8~weeks after intervention as posttest. RESULTS: Although both interventions significantly reduced pain (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .87), improved function (triple hop test P = .004, {$\eta$}2 = .94; single-leg vertical jump P = .002, {$\eta$}2 = .93; and T test P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93) and strength (hip abduction (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .52), hip external rotation (P = .02, {$\eta$}2 = .95), knee flexion (P {$\leq$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .94), and knee extension (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .91) compared with the control group, FMC showed more significant improvements in comparison with TE. Significant differences (P = .001) were observed between FMC and TE compared with the control group in ROM outcome. However, TE was more effective than FMC in improving ROM hip abduction (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93), hip adduction (P = .000, {$\eta$}2 = .92), hip internal rotation (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .92), and hip external rotation (P {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}2 = .93). CONCLUSION: FMC exercises were superior to TE in terms of pain, function, and muscle strength, whereas TE was more effective for improving ROM. FMC exercise is suggested as an effective intervention for improvement of the outcomes related to ITBS in national-level Greco Roman wrestlers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mixed martial arts (MMA) is a combat sport underpinned by techniques from other combat disciplines, in addition to strategies unique to the sport itself. These sports can be divided into two distinct categories (grappling or striking) based on differing technical demands. Uniquely, MMA combines both methods of combat and therefore appears to be physiologically complex requiring a spectrum of mechanical and metabolic qualities to drive performance. However, little is known about the physiological characteristics that distinguish higher- from lower-level MMA athletes. Such information provides guidance for training interventions, performance testing and talent identification. Furthermore, while MMA incorporates techniques from both grappling and striking sports, it is unknown precisely how these disciplines differ physiologically. Understanding the relationship between higher-level competitors in grappling and striking combat sports can provide further insight into the development of the optimal performance profile of a higher-level MMA athlete. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to analyse the scientific literature on MMA and the primary combat sports underpinning it to determine the physiological adaptations that distinguish superior competitors, with a view to defining the optimal physiological profile for higher-level MMA performance. Furthermore, this article will explore the differences in these capabilities between grappling- and striking-based combat sports in the context of MMA. METHODS: A literature search was undertaken via PubMed, Web of Science, SportDiscus and Google Scholar. The following sports were included for systematic review based on their relevance to MMA: mixed martial arts, boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, judo, karate, kickboxing, Muay Thai and wrestling. The inclusion criteria allowed studies that compared athletes of differing competition levels in the same sport using a physiological performance measure. Only male, adult (aged 17-40~years), able-bodied competitors were included. The search history spanned from the earliest record until September 2015. RESULTS: Of the eight combat sports searched for, five were represented across 23 studies. Sixteen investigations described maximal strength or neuromuscular power variables, while 19 articles reported anaerobic or aerobic measures. The results indicate that a number of strength, neuromuscular power and anaerobic variables distinguished higher- from lower-level combat sport athletes. However, these differences were less clear when groups were stratified within, rather than between competition grades. Greater aerobic power was generally not present amongst superior combat sport competitors. CONCLUSION: There appear to be differing physiological profiles between more successful grappling and striking combat sport athletes. This is represented by high-force demands of grappling sports causing an upwards shift of the entire force-velocity relationship driven by an increase in maximal strength. In comparison, smaller increases in maximal force production with more notable enhancements in lighter load, higher velocity actions may better identify superior performance in striking sports. Anaerobic capabilities largely distinguished higher- from lower-level combat sport athletes. In particular, longer-term anaerobic efforts seem to define successful grappling-based athletes, while superior competitors in striking sports tend to show dominance in shorter-term measures when compared with their lower-level counterparts. Given the demand for both forms of combat in MMA, a spectrum of physiological markers may characterize higher-level competitors. Furthermore, the performance profile of successful MMA athletes may differ based on combat sport history or competition strategy.},

Research also indicates how biological grounding initiatives can sometimes be compromised, or inappropriate, and the need to take additional factors into account as potential contributory factors, or confounders, to expected results. It is proposed that expanding electromagnetic hygiene measures beyond biological grounding alone may help reduce spread of communicable diseases, incidence of respiratory conditions, neurodegenerative disease and all-cause mortality. Identifying potential synergies that exist could enable multilevel interventions to further increase the efficacy of measures. It is hoped that this review will help act as a catalyst to inspire and inform multi-disciplinary research within these topic areas, best practices and policies to help drive medical innovation, reduce health burdens, improve bioelectromagnetic-based therapies, and influence the general design of the built environment and next-generation technologies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied the effects of home interferential current therapy (IFC) on postoperative pain, range of motion, and edema in subjects undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, menisectomy, or knee chondroplasty. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary care outpatient orthopaedic clinic/ambulatory surgery center. SUBJECTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven subjects were separated into three groups based on their type of knee surgery and within each group randomized into a treatment or placebo group. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects received home IFC units. Subjects randomized to treatment group received a working IFC unit. Placebo subjects received units that were previously set to deliver no current. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Post-operative edema at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and weeks 1-8; range of motion at 1, 3, 6, and 9 weeks; pain immediately after surgery, at 24, 48, and 72 hours, and weeks 1-7; and amount of pain medication taken at days 1-10 were compared between treatment and placebo groups. RESULTS: All IFC subjects reported significantly less pain and had significantly greater range of motion at all post-operative time points. ACL and menisectomy IFC subjects experienced significantly less edema at all time points, while chondroplasty subjects experienced significantly less edema until 4 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that home IFC may help reduce pain, pain medication taken, and swelling while increasing range of motion in patients undergoing knee surgery. This could result in quicker return to activities of daily living and athletic activities.},

Recent work illuminating the complex genetic architecture of AD is discussed in the context of high and low risk and what is known in different populations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                A small proportion of AD is autosomal dominant familial AD caused by variants in                 PSEN1, PSEN2,                 or                 APP                 , although more recently described rare genetic changes can also increase risk substantially over the general population, with odds ratios estimated at 2 to 4.                 APOE                 remains the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, and understanding the biology of                 APOE                 has yielded mechanistic insights and leads for therapeutic interventions. Genome-wide studies enabled by rapidly developing technologic advances in sequencing have identified numerous risk factors that have a low impact on risk but are widely shared throughout the population and involve a repertoire of cell pathways, again shining light on potential paths to intervention. Population studies aimed at defining and stratifying genetic AD risk have been informative, although they are not yet widely applicable clinically because the studies were not performed in people with diverse ancestry and ethnicity and thus population-wide data are lacking.                                                        SUMMARY               The value of genetic information to practitioners in the clinic is distinct from information sought by researchers looking to identify novel therapeutic targets. It is possible to envision a future in which genetic stratification joins other biomarkers to facilitate therapeutic choices and inform prognosis. Genetics already has transformed our understanding of AD pathogenesis and will, no doubt, continue to reveal the complexity of brain biology in health and disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypercholesterolemia is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease, but the association between cholesterol level change and mortality is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the association of 2 year (2002-2003 to 2004-2005) change in cholesterol with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study population consisted of 269,391 participants aged more than 40 years who were free of myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort. Cholesterol levels were classified into 1st, 2nd and 3rd tertiles during each of the first and second health examinations, respectively. The participants were followed-up for all-cause and cause-specific mortality from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. Compared to participants who stayed within the 2nd tertile group for cholesterol during both the first and second examinations, participants who became or maintained cholesterol levels to the 1st tertile during the second examination had increased risk of all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.28 (1.18-1.38) in 1st/1st, 1.16 (1.07-1.26) in 2nd/1st and 1.47 (1.32-1.64) in 3rd/1st tertile levels, respectively]. In addition, increased or persistent high cholesterol levels to the 3rd tertile was associated with elevated risk for all-cause mortality [aHR (95\% CI) = 1.10 (1.01-1.20) in 1st/2nd, 1.16(1.03-1.31) in 1st/3rd and 1.15(1.05-1.25) in 3rd/3rd tertile levels]. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in cholesterol levels in either direction to low cholesterol or persistently low cholesterol levels were associated with higher risk of mortality. Particularly, spontaneous decline in cholesterol levels may be a marker for worsening health conditions.},

Increased understanding of these pathologic entities is important for the neurologist who may encounter patients with an unusually slowly progressive degenerative dementia that may appear to meet criteria for Alzheimer disease but who progress to develop symptoms that are unusual for classic Alzheimer disease                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Hippocampal sclerosis has traditionally been associated with hypoxic/ischemic injury and poorly controlled epilepsy, but it is now recognized that hippocampal sclerosis may also be associated with a unique degenerative disease of aging or may be an associated pathologic finding in many cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Argyrophilic grain disease has been recognized as an enigma in the field of pathology for over 30 years, but recent discoveries suggest that it may overlap with other tau-related disorders within the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Primary age-related tauopathy has long been recognized as a distinct clinical entity that lies on the Alzheimer pathologic spectrum, with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles that lack the coexistent Alzheimer plaque development; thus, it is thought to represent a distinct pathologic entity.                                         SUMMARY               Despite advances in dementia diagnosis that suggest that we have identified and unlocked the mysteries of the major degenerative disease states responsible for cognitive decline and dementia in the elderly, diseases such as hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease, and primary age-related tauopathy demonstrate that we remain on the frontier of discovery and that our diagnostic repertoire of diseases responsible for such clinical symptoms remains in its infancy. Understanding such diagnostic confounds is important for the neurologist in assigning appropriate diagnoses and selecting appropriate therapeutic management strategies for patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Chronic pain is maintained in part by central sensitization, a phenomenon of synaptic plasticity, and increased neuronal responsiveness in central pain pathways after painful insults. Accumulating evidence suggests that central sensitization is also driven by neuroinflammation in the peripheral and central nervous system. A characteristic feature of neuroinflammation is the activation of glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, in the spinal cord and brain, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Recent studies suggest that central cytokines and chemokines are powerful neuromodulators and play a sufficient role in inducing hyperalgesia and allodynia after central nervous system administration. Sustained increase of cytokines and chemokines in the central nervous system also promotes chronic widespread pain that affects multiple body sites. Thus, neuroinflammation drives widespread chronic pain via central sensitization. We also discuss sex-dependent glial/immune signaling in chronic pain and new therapeutic approaches that control neuroinflammation for the resolution of chronic pain.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although many different clinical manifestations of dystonia have been recognized for decades, it is only in the past 5 years that a broadly accepted approach has emerged for classifying them into specific subgroups. The new classification system aids clinical recognition and diagnosis by focusing on key clinical features that help distinguish the many subtypes. In the past few years, major advances have been made in the discovery of new genes as well as advances in our understanding of the biological processes involved. These advances have led to major changes in strategies for diagnosis of the inherited dystonias. An emerging trend is to move away from heavy reliance on the phenotype to target diagnostic testing toward a broader approach that involves large gene panels or whole exome sequencing.                                         SUMMARY               The dystonias are a large family of phenotypically and etiologically diverse disorders. The diagnosis of these disorders depends on clinical recognition of characteristic clinical features. Symptomatic treatments are useful for all forms of dystonia and include oral medications, botulinum toxins, and surgical procedures. Determination of etiology is becoming increasingly important because the number of disorders is growing and more specific and sometimes disease-modifying therapies now exist.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW: Referred pain is a common but less understood symptom that originates from somatic tissues. A comprehensive recognition of referred pain is important for clinicians when dealing with it. The purpose of this study is to summarize the current understanding of referred pain, including its pathogenesis, characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Referred pain arises not only from pathologies primarily involving local tissue but also from lesions in distant structures. Central sensitization of convergent neurons and peripheral reflexes of dichotomizing afferent fibers are two theories proposed to explain the pathological mechanism of referred pain. Because syndromes related to referred pain of different origins overlap each other, it is challenging to define referred pain and identify its originating lesions. Although various approaches have been used in the diagnosis and treatment of referred pain, including conservative treatment, blockade, radiofrequency, and surgery, management of referred pain remains a clinical challenge. SUMMARY: Unlike radicular pain and neuropathic pain, referred pain is a less studied area, despite being common in clinics. Referred pain can derive from various spinal structures, and blockage helps identify the primary pathology. Due to the heterogeneity of referred pain, treatment outcomes remain uncertain. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of referred pain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low testosterone (T) levels in men associate with increased risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. However, most studies are cross-sectional with follow-up-time {$<$}10 years, and data on early growth are limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare prenatal factors and body mass index (BMI) development from birth to age 46 in relation to low T at age 31. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Men with low T (T{$<$}12.1nmol/l, n = 132) and men with normal T at age 31 (n = 2561) were derived from the Northern Finland birth cohort 1966. Prenatal factors, longitudinal weight and height data from birth to age 14, and cross-sectional weight and height data at ages 31 and 46, and waist-hip-ratio (WHR) and T levels at age 31 were analysed. Longitudinal modelling and timing of adiposity rebound (AR, second BMI rise at age 5-7 years) were calculated from fitted BMI curves. Results were adjusted for mother's pre-pregnancy BMI and smoking status, birth weight for gestational age, alcohol consumption, education level, smoking status and WHR at age 31. RESULTS: Neither gestational age nor birth weight was associated with low T at age 31, however maternal obesity during gestation was more prevalent among men with low T (9.8\% vs 3.5\%, adjusted aOR: 2.43 (1.19-4.98)). Men with low T had earlier AR (5.28 vs 5.82, aOR: 0.73 (0.56-0.94)) and higher BMI (P{$<$}.001) from AR onwards until age 46. Men with both early AR and low T had the highest BMI from AR onwards. CONCLUSIONS: In men, maternal obesity and early weight gain associate with lower T levels at age 31, independently of adulthood abdominal obesity. Given the well-known health risks related to obesity, and the rising prevalence of maternal obesity, the results of the present study emphasize the importance of preventing obesity that may affect also later reproductive health of the offspring.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Randomized clinical trials have shown that aerobic exercise attenuates motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated how aerobic exercise influences disease-related functional and structural changes in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network, which is involved in the emergence of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we explored effects of aerobic exercise on tissue integrity of the substantia nigra, and on behavioral and cerebral indices of cognitive control. METHODS: The Park-in-Shape trial is a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial in 130 Parkinson's disease patients who were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to aerobic exercise (stationary home trainer) or stretching (active control) interventions (duration~=~6 months). An unselected subset from this trial (exercise, n~=~25; stretching, n~=~31) underwent resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an oculomotor cognitive control task (pro- and antisaccades), at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise, but not stretching, led to increased functional connectivity of the anterior putamen with the sensorimotor cortex relative to the posterior putamen. Behaviorally, aerobic exercise also improved cognitive control. Furthermore, aerobic exercise increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, proportionally to fitness improvements, and it reduced global brain atrophy. INTERPRETATION: MRI, clinical, and behavioral results converge toward the conclusion that aerobic exercise stabilizes disease progression in the corticostriatal sensorimotor network and enhances cognitive performance.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The selection of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) is essential for obtaining meaningful information to treat a patient, determine a plan of care, and make clinical decisions; however, the process of selecting PROMs for clinical care is difficult, with the need to balance these multiple factors. Variation makes it difficult to compare data across providers and studies. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The purpose was to determine the responsiveness of 4 PROMs via effect size and the presence of a ceiling effect in the 5 years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). We hypothesized that the single-item Global Rating Scale (GRS) would have an effect size and ceiling effect similar to the commonly used legacy PROMs. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Of the 300 participants, 218 had ACLR, completed postoperative progressive criterion-based rehabilitation early after surgery, and were followed for 5 years. We collected data based on the GRS, the Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale (KOS-ADLS), the International Knee Documentation Committee-Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF), and the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) before and after training and at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after ACLR. RESULTS: The IKDC-SKF had the largest effect sizes and lowest ceiling effects. The GRS had a similar size and change in both effect size and ceiling effect when compared with the longer PROMs. The GRS and IKDC-SKF had a correlation of 0.72, and the GRS had a minimal detectable change of 2.9 or 4.8, depending on methodology. CONCLUSION: The GRS responded similarly to the IKDC-SKF, KOS-ADLS, and KOOS and was responsive to patient change. The ease of use and patient-specific nature of the question means that it may be appropriate to use the GRS in clinical care as a consistent measure throughout the course of rehabilitation.},

This article describes the classification scheme, common subtypes, and the management of individuals with LGMD.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Advances in genetic testing and next-generation sequencing panels containing all of the LGMD genes have led to earlier genetic confirmation, but also to more individuals with variants of uncertain significance. The LGMDs include disorders with autosomal recessive inheritance, which are often due to loss-of-function mutations in muscle structural or repair proteins and typically have younger ages of onset and more rapidly progressive presentations, and those with autosomal dominant inheritance, which can have older ages of presentation and chronic progressive disease courses. All cause progressive disability and potential loss of ability to walk or maintain a job due to progressive muscle wasting. Certain mutations are associated with cardiac or respiratory involvement. No disease-altering therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for LGMDs and standard treatment uses a multidisciplinary clinic model, but recessive LGMDs are potentially amenable to systemic gene replacement therapies, which are already being tested in clinical trials for sarcoglycan and                 FKRP                 mutations. The dominant LGMDs may be amenable to RNA-based therapeutic approaches.

  abstract = {Multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder was first described in 1980 as a complex condition of the shoulder defined by instability in 2 or more planes of motion.~The shoulder joint is unique in the way it provides a tremendous range of motion. In fact, it has the greatest mobility of any joint in the human body. However, mobility and stability are inversely proportional, and the complex interplay between the stabilizers of the shoulder works with little margin for error before instability occurs. Therefore the balance between the extraordinary physiologic range of motion and shoulder stability has proved to be delicate. The primary responsibility of the shoulder is to position the hand in space. Hence, some activities show preference toward mobility (swimming) while others favor stability (weight lifting, football lineman).~Shoulder stability is maintained through both dynamic and static stabilizers. The dynamic structures responsible for joint stability include the rotator cuff muscles, the tendon of the long head of the biceps, and the periscapular musculature. The static stabilizers include the glenohumeral articular congruity, glenoid labrum complex, glenohumeral ligaments as well as the negative pressure created within the joint. Shoulder instability becomes symptomatic once the motion of the humeral head exceeds the boundaries set by the glenoid labrum complex. This is a result of pathology within the static and/or dynamic stabilizers. Shoulder instability was originally thought to fall within one of two categories. The first is Traumatic Unilateral with Bankart lesion treated Surgically (TUBS). The second category is Atraumatic, Multidirectional, Bilateral, which typically responds to Rehabilitation or Inferior capsular shift (AMBRI). Although these two categories offer a simple classification system for MDI, they are oversimplified and do not fully represent the full spectrum of pathologic laxity. As we have discovered more about the MDI process, modifications have been made to the original simplistic classification.},

The clinical manifestations of lesions to the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal, and frontopolar cortex are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Traditional lesion studies have emphasized the role of a brain region in controlling a cognitive function. With advances in neurology, neuropsychology, and neuroimaging, the participation of the prefrontal cortex in large-scale networks has been established with recognition that cognitive dysfunction can arise not only from a lesion within a network but also from degenerative disease targeting these large-scale, dynamic neural networks. Although executive dysfunction can result from frontal lobe injury, this article highlights the role of distributed processes subserving executive functions. An atypical phenotype of Alzheimer disease has been described that selectively targets parietal-temporal-frontal networks important for core executive functions.                                         SUMMARY               Executive function comprises working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition and depends on top-down (ie, goal-driven) control of distributed processes occurring throughout the brain. The exact behavioral output (ie, function) depends on the content of the processes being controlled. Prefrontal cortex regions serve key cognitive functions related to social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior. The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in working memory, goal-driven attention, task switching, planning, problem-solving, and novelty-seeking. The ventral lateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in inhibition, response selection, and monitoring; the medial prefrontal cortex in self-knowledge, motivation, emotional regulation, and updating goal-directed behavior; the orbitofrontal cortex in personality, inhibition, and emotional and social reasoning. Although dysexecutive syndromes have been traditionally associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex injury, it is now recognized that they can also result from an impaired parietal-temporal-frontal system, which is targeted in a distinct form of atypical Alzheimer disease. This dysexecutive Alzheimer phenotype is characterized by impaired task performance on a wide battery of neuropsychological tests and simple daily tasks that require executive control. In contrast, dysexecutive syndromes more localized to the frontal lobe involve impaired executive control of social, emotional, and motivational aspects of behavior.},

Methods               A literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Two researchers independently assessed eligibility and performed data extraction and quality assessments. Eligibility criteria: Study populations with ND, BFRE as intervention modality, outcome measures related to safety or efficacy.                                         Results               Out of 443 studies identified, 16 were deemed eligible for review. Three studies examined the efficacy and safety of BFRE, one study focused on efficacy results, and 12 studies investigated safety. Disease populations included spinal cord injury (SCI), inclusion body myositis (sIBM), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. A moderate-to-high risk of bias was presented in the quality assessment. Five studies reported safety concerns, including acutely elevated pain and rating of perceived exertion levels, severe fatigue, muscle soreness, and cases of autonomic dysreflexia. Two RCTs reported a significant between-group difference in physical function outcomes, and two RCTs reported neuromuscular adaptations.                                         Conclusion               BFRE seems to be a potentially safe and effective training modality in individuals with ND. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to limited quality and number of studies, small sample sizes, and a general lack of heterogeneity within and between the examined patient cohorts.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to review surgical anatomy of the trigeminal nerve. We also demonstrate some pictures involving the trigeminal nerve and its surrounding connective and neurovascular structures. Ten adult cadaveric heads were studied, using a magnification ranging from 3{\texttimes} to 40{\texttimes}, after perfusion of the arteries and veins with colored latex. The trigeminal nerve is the largest and most complex of the cranial nerves. It serves as a major conduit of sensory input from the face and provides motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. Because of its size and complexity, it is essential to have thorough knowledge of the nerve before diagnoses and treatment of the pathologic processes in the orofacial, temporomandibular, infratemporal, and pterygopalatine areas. The trigeminal nerve is encountered with imaging or surgery of the skull base surgery. Thus, a comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve is crucial for performing the surgical procedures without significant complication. Clin.

This article reviews the definition of psychotic symptoms and the evaluation and management of psychosis in primary psychiatric and neurologic disorders frequently seen in neurologic practice.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Emerging evidence supports significant connections between psychosis and structural and functional brain changes in both primary psychotic and neurologic disorders. In addition to antidopaminergic activity, the mechanism of new-generation antipsychotics shifts to act on serotonin receptors, which potentially contributes to their benefits in the treatment of negative symptoms of psychosis and a lesser frequency of extrapyramidal side effects compared with typical antipsychotics. This is also helpful in the treatment of psychosis in patients who have neurodegenerative diseases and are vulnerable to developing extrapyramidal side effects from typical antipsychotics.                                         SUMMARY               Even with significant overlap, management of psychosis in primary psychotic disorders differs from the approach of psychosis in neurologic diseases. This article helps clinicians learn how to practically evaluate psychosis from both psychiatric and neurologic perspectives.},

It causes mortality and disability among all group ages, caused by external force, sports-related events or violence and road traffic accidents. In the USA, approximately one-third people die annually due to injury and 1.7 million people suffer from traumatic brain injury. Every year in India around 1.6 million individuals suffer from sustain brain injury with 200,000 deaths and approximately one million person needed recovery treatment at any stage of time. Sports-related head impact and trauma has become an extremely controversial public health and medico-legal problem that accounts for 20\% of all brain injury (including concussion). It is difficult to reverse the primary injury but the secondary injury can be minimized by using proper pharmacological intervention during the initial hours of injury. This article highlights the pathophysiology and types of TBI along with treatment therapies. Till date, there is no single medication that can decrease the progression of the disease so that symptomatic treatment is given to the patient by determining proper pathology. Recently various herbal medicine therapies and traditional supplements have been developed for TBI. Nutritional supplementation and nutraceuticals have exposed potential in the treatment of TBI when used before and after TBI. The compiled data will enable the readers to know the pathophysiology as well as the allopathic and natural remedies to treat the TBI.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Most cryptogenic strokes appear embolic, leading to the term                 embolic stroke of undetermined source                 . It was previously thought that embolic stroke of undetermined source was a single, therapeutically relevant entity, the underlying sources of which would respond to anticoagulant therapy; however, two large randomized trials found no benefit with anticoagulation compared to antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention after embolic stroke of undetermined source. A single antiplatelet drug remains the recommended long-term antithrombotic treatment for secondary stroke prevention in embolic stroke of undetermined source. However, three caveats should be considered with regard to cryptogenic stroke. First, those with minor stroke symptoms presenting early after onset should receive 3 weeks of dual antiplatelet therapy. Second, all patients with cryptogenic stroke should be monitored for atrial fibrillation. Third, patients 60 years of age or younger with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) should be carefully evaluated to determine whether the PFO may have caused the stroke and whether they might benefit from PFO closure.                                                        SUMMARY               More personalized strategies may soon be available to guide treatment of cryptogenic stroke. In the meantime, it is hoped that the application of recent findings from clinical trials will reduce stroke recurrence in this important population.},

In addition, dissatisfaction after treatment at one site may be the result of persistent pathology at another site along a peripheral nerve. Double crush syndrome is a controversial diagnosis; some scientists and surgeons believe it is an illness construction that may do more harm than good because it emphasizes an objective pathophysiologic explanation for unexplained symptoms, disability, and dissatisfaction that may be more psychosocially mediated. However, peripheral neuropathy may coexist with compressive neuropathy and contribute to suboptimal outcomes following nerve decompression. To better manage patients' expectations, treating practitioners should be aware of the possibility of concomitant cervical radiculopathy and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as the presence of underlying systemic neuropathy.},

DESIGN: A randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial. SETTINGS: Physiotherapy clinic at a university. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients were randomized into an 8-week (2 times/week) shoulder rehabilitation, that is, BFR or non-BFR group. INTERVENTIONS: BFR training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) RC, deltoid, scapula retractor, and biceps muscle thicknesses and shoulder internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) strengths. (2) Shoulder pain/function. RESULTS: The BFR group had a greater increase in biceps muscle thickness ( P = 0.002) and shoulder IR strength at 60 degrees/s ( P = 0.040) than the non-BFR group. No differences between the 2 groups were observed in other measurements. Significant improvements in supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and scapula retractor muscle thicknesses and in shoulder ER and IR strengths were observed over time in both the groups (all P {$<$} 0 .05). Also, shoulder pain decreased and shoulder function increased over time in both the groups (all P {$<$} 0 .05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-load BFR training resulted in a greater increase in biceps thickness and shoulder IR strength compared with the non-BFR group in patients with RC tendinopathy.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently available hand-held dynamometers (HHD) offer a more objective and reliable assessment of muscle force production as compared to a manual muscle test (MMT). Yet, their clinical utility is limited due to high cost. The ActivForce (AF) digital dynamometer is a new low-cost HHD with unknown psychometric properties, and its utilization may benefit clinical practice. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the AF intra- and inter-tester reliabilities, standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and criterion validity for assessing shoulder isometric force as compared to the microFET2 (MF2) across testers with different experiences. DESIGN: Descriptive observational study. METHODS: A convenience sample of 29 healthy adults were assessed twice by each of three testers (two experienced clinicians and a novice PT student) on shoulder external rotation (ER), internal rotation (IR), and forward elevation (FE) using both the AF and MF2 devices. Tester, HHD, and shoulder motion assignment orders were randomized. All testing was performed in a standardized seated position. ER and IR were tested with the shoulder fully adducted. FE was tested at 45{$^\circ$} at the scapular plane. All testing and rest periods between testers and tested motions were standardized and monitored via a stopwatch. RESULTS: Both devices had high intra- [~ER (.95-.98), IR (.97 - .99), FE (.96 - .99)] and inter-tester [~ER (.85-.96), IR (.95 - .97), FE (.88 - .95)] intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with comparable intra- (1.68-1.80) and inter-tester (2.36-2.98) SEM, and intra- (4.64-4.97) and inter-tester (6.50-8.24) MDC values across all motions. Tester experience did not affect these values. High (.89-.93) statistically significant Pearson correlations were found between HHDs for all shoulder motions. CONCLUSION: Both the AF and MF2 HHDs were found to have high reliability levels across all shoulder motions regardless of tester clinical experience. The AF was also found to be valid for measuring shoulder isometric force production compared to the criterion standard device, the MF2. Its low-cost and electronic accessibility features may promote better compliance for clinicians using dynamometry to objectively assess and store muscle force data in a cost-effective manner.

PURPOSE: To review the diagnostic accuracy of examination tests used in LET. DESIGN: Systematic review following PRISMA-DTA guidelines. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PEDro, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases. The QUADAS-2 checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the eligible studies. We included diagnostic studies reporting the accuracy of physical examination tests or imaging modalities used in patients with LET. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with 1370 participants were identified reporting the diagnostic performance of Ultrasound Imaging (USI) (18 studies), physical examination tests (2 studies) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (4 studies). Most studies (97\%) were assessed with "unclear" or "high risk" of bias. Sonoelastography showed the highest sensitivity (75- 100\%) and specificity (85- 96\%). Grayscale with or without Doppler USI presented poor to excellent values (sensitivity: 53\%-100\%, specificity: 42\%-90\%). MRI performed better in the diagnosis of tendon thickening and enthesopathy (sensitivity and specificity: 81\%-100\%). The Cozen's test reported high sensitivity (91\%) while a grip strength difference of 5\%-10\% between elbow flexion and extension showed high sensitivity (78\%-83\%) and specificity (80\%-90\%). CONCLUSIONS: Cozen's test and grip strength measurement present high accuracy in the diagnosis of LET but are poorly investigated. USI and MRI provide variable diagnostic accuracy depending on the entities reported and should be recommended with caution when differential diagnosis is necessary. Substantial heterogeneity was found in inclusion criteria, operator/ examiner, mode of application, type of equipment and reference standards across the studies.

INTERVENTION: The intervention and control groups received a routine physiotherapy program. In addition, the intervention group performed neuromuscular exercises on the nonoperated limb. OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and 9~weeks after ACLR, dynamic and static balance, function, and pain in the reconstructed knee were measured by Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), stork balance stand test, balance error scoring system (BESS), Lysholm questionnaire, and visual analog scale. Data were analyzed by SPSS using 2-independent sample t test, paired t test, and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Between-group comparison showed that, contralateral knee neuromuscular exercises significantly increased in the reaching distance in~SEBT in the anterior (P {$<$} .001), posterior (P {$<$} .001), posteromedial (P = .010), and posterolateral directions (P = .007), decreased the number of errors in 4 stance positions of BESS including single stance on the firm (P {$\leq$} .001) and foam surface (P {$\leq$} .001), and tandem stance on the firm (P = .028) and foam surface (P {$\leq$} .001). It also increased the time of standing of the stork stand test (P = .044) and decreased the pain intensity (P = .014). CONCLUSION: Neuromuscular exercise of the nonsurgical knee could improve the dynamic and static balance, and pain in the early stages following ACLR in the surgical leg. These findings may be potentially valuable for current rehabilitation protocols.},

  abstract = {"Pusher syndrome" is a clinical disorder following left or right brain damage in which patients actively push away from the nonhemiparetic side, leading to a loss of postural balance. The mechanism underlying this disorder and its related anatomy have only recently been identified. Investigation of patients with severe pushing behavior has shown that perception of body posture in relation to gravity is altered. The patients experience their body as oriented "upright" when the body actually is tilted to the side of the brain lesion (to the ipsilesional side). In contrast, patients with pusher syndrome show no disturbed processing of visual and vestibular inputs determining visual vertical. These new insights have allowed the authors to suggest a new physical therapy approach for patients with pusher syndrome where the visual control of vertical upright orientation, which is undisturbed in these patients, is the central element of intervention.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               The premonitory phase of migraine is defined as the presence of nonpainful symptomatology occurring hours to days before the onset of headache. Symptoms can include neck stiffness, yawning, thirst, and increased frequency of micturition. Clinical recognition of these symptoms is important to ensure early and effective attack management. Further understanding of the clinical phenotype and neurobiological mediation of these symptoms is important in the advancement of therapeutics research in both acute and preventive treatments of migraine.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Since 2014, functional imaging studies have been conducted during the premonitory stage of migraine and have provided novel insights into the early neurobiology and anatomy of the earliest stage of the migraine attack. These studies have shown early involvement of subcortical brain areas including the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, dorsal pons, and various limbic cortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex during the premonitory phase. More recent work has revealed altered hypothalamic-brainstem functional connectivity during migraine, which starts before the onset of pain. These exciting findings have provided functional correlation of the symptoms experienced by patients and changes seen on functional brain imaging.                                         SUMMARY               This article focuses on the prevalence, phenotype, and proposed neurobiology of premonitory symptomatology in migraineurs as well as the scope of future research.},

  abstract = {In the context of impact on human health, nitrite/nitrate and related nitrogen species such as nitric oxide (NO) are a matter of increasing scientific controversy. An increase in the content of reactive nitrogen species may result in nitrosative stress-a deleterious process, which can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids, membranes, proteins and DNA. Nitrates and nitrites are widespread in the environment and occur naturally in foods of plant origin as a part of the nitrogen cycle. Additionally, these compounds are used as additives to improve food quality and protect against microbial contamination and chemical changes. Some vegetables such as raw spinach, beets, celery and lettuce are considered to contain high concentrations of nitrates. Due to the high consumption of vegetables, they have been identified as the primary source of nitrates in the human diet. Processed meats are another source of nitrites in our diet because the meat industry uses nitrates/nitrites as additives in the meat curing process. Although the vast majority of consumed nitrates and nitrites come from natural vegetables and fruits rather than food additives, there is currently a great deal of consumer pressure for the production of meat products free of or with reduced quantities of these compounds. This is because, for years, the cancer risks of nitrates/nitrites have been considered, since they potentially convert into the nitrosamines that have carcinogenic effects. This has resulted in the development and rapid expansion of meat products processed with plant-derived nitrates as nitrite alternatives in meat products. On the other hand, recently, these two ions have been discussed as essential nutrients which allow nitric oxide production and thus help cardiovascular health. Thus, this manuscript reviews the main sources of dietary exposure to nitrates and nitrites, metabolism of nitrites/nitrates, and health concerns related to dietary nitrites/nitrates, with particular emphasis on the effect on nitrosative stress, the role of nitrites/nitrates in meat products and alternatives to these additives used in meat products.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600\,000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis. OBSERVATIONS: The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11\% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50\% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10\% to 20\% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95\% CI, 0.8-14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10-12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0-100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95\% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0-100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2-4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4\% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9\% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30\% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11\% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established.

RECENT FINDINGS               Growing evidence indicates that palliative care significantly improves quality of life and symptom burden for people with Parkinson disease and other serious movement disorders, while reducing caregiver burnout. An emphasis on advance care planning guides goal-directed treatment recommendations. Serious illness communication skills are evidence-based methods of relaying bad medical news to patients and mapping out values and goals in a way that provides comfort, emphasizes patient autonomy, and builds coping and resiliency strategies.                                         SUMMARY               Palliative care, when offered alongside primary medical and neurologic teams, provides an extra layer of support for people with serious illnesses. The goal of palliative care is to intensively treat total pain, which includes all of the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual distress caused by serious illness. Serious illness communication skills are key to providing empathic and goal-concordant care.},

Consequently, optimal postoperative rehabilitation of MLKI remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the latest evidence for postoperative rehabilitation protocols following multiligamentous knee reconstruction (MLKR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multidatabase search was conducted with the aid of a health sciences librarian. Blinded reviewers conducted multiple screenings of studies evaluating postoperative rehabilitation protocols following MLKR. All included studies were then graded based on level of evidence, and data concerning patient demographics and rehabilitation protocols were extracted. RESULTS: MLKR rehabilitation protocols differ widely in terms of weightbearing, bracing, initiation, and types of physical therapy, yet several established protocols were referenced frequently throughout the literature. Such protocols resulted in good outcomes, with patients returning to running in 6 to 12 months and returning to sport in 8 to 12 months. CONCLUSION: The rare nature of MLKI hinders the ability to create a standardized rehabilitation protocol. However, early postoperative physical therapy and range of motion consistently lead to improved outcomes. Randomized studies are needed to determine optimal postoperative rehabilitation following MLKR.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adaptations in glenohumeral range of motion in overhead athletes lead to injuries of the upper extremity, specifically in the shoulder or elbow. DATA SOURCES: An electronic database search was performed using Medline, Embase, and SportDiscus from 1950 to 2016. The following keywords were used: GIRD, glenohumeral internal rotation deficit, glenohumeral deficit, shoulder, sport, injury, shoulder joint, baseball, football, racquet sports, volleyball, javelin, cricket, athletic injuries, handball, lacrosse, water polo, hammer throw, and throwing injury. STUDY SELECTION: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Of those 17 studies, 10 included specific range of motion measurements required for inclusion in the meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on demographics and methodology as well as shoulder range of motion in various planes were collected when possible. The primary outcome of interest was upper extremity injury, specifically shoulder or elbow injury. RESULTS: The systematic review included 2195 athletes (1889 males, 306 females) with a mean age of 20.8 years. Shoulders with GIRD favored an upper extremity injury, with a mean difference of 3.11{$^\circ$} (95\% CI, -0.13{$^\circ$} to 6.36{$^\circ$}; P = 0.06). Shoulder total range of motion suggested increased motion (mean difference, 2.97{$^\circ$}) correlated with no injury ( P = 0.11), and less total motion (mean difference, 1.95{$^\circ$}) favored injury ( P = 0.14). External rotational gain also favored injury, with a mean difference of 1.93{$^\circ$} ( P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: The pooled results of this systematic review and meta-analysis did not reach statistical significance for any shoulder motion measurement and its correlation to shoulder or elbow injury. Results, though not reaching significance, favored injury in overhead athletes with GIRD, as well as rotational loss and external rotational gain.},

Fourteen young healthy males participated in this study. Using ultrasound shear-wave elastography, fascia elastic modulus was measured at rest (passive condition) and during submaximal isometric knee flexion efforts (active condition) with the hip at neutral position and the knee flexed at 0{$^\circ$}, 45{$^\circ$}, and 90{$^\circ$}. Analysis of variance designs indicated that when the knee was passively extended from 90{$^\circ$} to 0{$^\circ$}, shear modulus of the TLF, SMF, and STF increased significantly (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Similarly, active knee flexion contractions caused a significant increase in TLF, SMF, and STF shear modulus (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Compared to hamstring fascia, the TLF showed greater thickness but a lower shear modulus (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) while STF modulus was greater compared that to SMF during active contraction (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). These results indicate that exercising the hamstring muscles can remotely influence the stiffness of the fascia which surrounds the lumbar area.},

Forty-three patients (32\,M, 13\,F; mean age\,\,=\,\,26.00\,\,{\textpm}\,\,8.19 years) undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repair completed three validated shoulder questionnaires (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability index (WOSI), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment form (ASES), Constant score) preoperatively, and at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Responsiveness and discriminant validity was assessed between those with a satisfactory outcome and those with (1) a major recurrence of instability, (2) a single episode of subluxation, (3) any postoperative episode of instability. Eight (20\%) patients reported recurrent instability. Compared to baseline, the WOSI detected improvement at the 6- (                                                   P                   {$<$}                   0.001                                               ) and 12-month (                                                   P                   =                   0.011                                               ) evaluations. The ASES showed improvement at 6 months (                                                   P                   =                   0.003                                               ), while the Constant score did not report significant improvement until 12 months postoperatively (                                                   P                   =                   0.001                                               ). Only the WOSI detected differential shoulder function related to shoulder instability. Those experiencing even a single episode of subluxation reported a 10\% drop in their WOSI score, attaining the previously established minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Those experiencing a frank dislocation or multiple episodes of subluxation reported a 20\% decline. The WOSI allows better discrimination of the severity of postoperative instability symptoms following arthroscopic Bankart repair.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a summary of the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with episodic positional dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Positional components are nearly ubiquitous among diagnoses of dizziness, so it can be challenging to classify patients with episodic positional dizziness simply based on the history of present illness. Overreliance on the presence of a report of positional components has likely resulted in misapplication or misinterpretation of positional testing and negative experiences with maneuvers to treat positional dizziness. The prototypical episodic positional dizziness disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by free-floating particles in a semicircular canal that move in response to gravity. The diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic patterns of nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Particle repositioning for BPPV is supported by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. Other disorders that can present with episodic positional dizziness are migraine dizziness, central lesions, and light cupula syndrome. SUMMARY: Episodic positional dizziness is a common presentation of dizziness. Neurologists should prioritize identifying and treating BPPV; doing so provides an important opportunity to deliver effective and efficient care. Providers should also recognize that positional components are common in most causes of dizziness and, therefore, should not over-rely on this part of the history of presentation when considering the diagnosis and management plan.},

  abstract = {Horner syndrome is a rare condition classically presenting with partial ptosis (drooping or falling of upper eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and facial anhidrosis (loss of sweating) due to a disruption in the sympathetic nerve supply. It is primarily acquired following damage to the sympathetic nerve supply, but rare cases of congenital forms have~been seen. Therefore, treatment is centered around identifying and appropriate~management of the underlying secondary cause. The syndrome has several names, such as Bernard-Horner syndrome (French-speaking countries), Horner syndrome (English speaking countries), oculosympathetic palsy, and Von Passow syndrome (Horner syndrome in association with iris heterochromia). The syndrome was first described by Francois Pourfour du Petit in 1727 when considering results from an animal experiment involving resection of intercostal nerves and subsequent changes seen in the ipsilateral eye and face. It was outlined more thoroughly by the French physiologist Claude Bernard in 1852, followed by several physicians who offered different interpretations. The condition was formally described and later named after Swiss ophthalmologist Johann Friedrich Horner in 1869. Anatomy Understanding the sympathetic innervation of the eye is vital to understanding the features of this syndrome. The nerve supply is constituted by three different neurons, starting from the posterolateral hypothalamus and ending as the long ciliary nerves to supply the iris dilator and superior tarsal muscles (Muller muscle). The first-order neurons originate from the hypothalamus and descend through the midbrain and pons uncrossed, terminating at the C8-T2 level of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral cell columns (ciliospinal center of Budge). Second-order preganglionic neurons exit at the T1 level of the spinal cord to enter the cervical sympathetic chain, where the fibers ascend to synapse in the superior cervical ganglion at the C3-C4 level. Third-order, postganglionic fibers branch off into the sudomotor and vasomotor fibers, which follow the external carotid artery and innervate the sweat glands and blood vessels of the face. The remaining fibers ascend along the internal carotid artery in the carotid plexus to eventually enter the cavernous sinus, where they join the abducens nerve (CN VI). The fibers then exit the cavernous sinus to enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure and the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) as the long ciliary nerves.},

A systematic search was performed (August 2019) in MEDLINE, PEDro, National Guideline Clearinghouse, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG), International Guideline Library, Guideline central, and Google Scholar. Guidelines presenting recommendations on diagnosis and/or treatment of adult patients with LRP were included. Two independent reviewers selected eligible guidelines, evaluated quality with Appraisal of Guidelines Research \& Evaluation (AGREE) II, and extracted recommendations. Recommendations were classified into 'should do', 'could do', 'do not do', or 'uncertain'; their consistency was labelled as 'consistent', 'common', or 'inconsistent'. Twenty-three guidelines of varying quality (AGREE II overall assessment ranging from 17\% to 92\%) were included. Consistent recommendations regarding diagnosis are ('should do'): Straight leg raise (SLR) test, crossed SLR test, mapping pain distribution, gait assessment, congruence of signs and symptoms. Routine use of imaging is consistently not recommended. The following therapeutic options are consistently recommended ('should do'): educational care, physical activity, discectomy under specific circumstances (e.g., failure of conservative treatment). Referral to a specialist is recommended when conservative therapy fails or when steppage gait is present. These recommendations provide a clear overview of the management options in patients with LRP.},

The purpose of this meeting, hosted by the Shoulder Center of Kentucky, was to continue to examine the biomechanical and clinical factors thought to be associated with the role of the scapula in shoulder function and dysfunction. Since the last Summit, much more information has been created in this area, and it was thought that enough progress had been made that an organized overview of current knowledge could provide some consensus statements to guide further research and provide assessment and treatment guidelines. A call for abstracts was extended to researchers with proven interest and published research on the scapula. The meeting was organized around 3 primary categories of information: scapular kinematics and dysfunction, clinical evaluation of the scapula, and interventions. The last session of the meeting involved development of consensus statements for each category. This document represents the current state of knowledge concerning the aspects of scapular function and dysfunction discussed at the Summit. It is expected that, as more knowledge is developed, the gaps will be filled in and a clearer understanding of the roles of the scapula in shoulder function will emerge. This issue includes the consensus statements and abstracts from the Summit.},

STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: We used nine fresh cadaveric shoulders with the arm at 90 degrees of abduction and 90 degrees of external rotation. The position of the humeral head was monitored by an electromagnetic tracking device with 0 and 1.5 kg of anterior translation force; with 0, 1, 3, and 5 kg of force applied to each of the anterior, middle, and posterior portions of the deltoid muscle; and with the capsule intact, vented, and with a simulated Bankart lesion. RESULTS: With the capsule intact, anterior displacement was significantly reduced by application of load to the middle deltoid muscle. After the capsule was vented, load application to the anterior, middle, or posterior deltoid muscle significantly reduced anterior displacement. With a simulated Bankart lesion, effects of muscle loading were most apparent: anterior displacement was significantly reduced with loading of each muscle portion. CONCLUSION: The deltoid muscle is an anterior stabilizer of the glenohumeral joint with the arm in abduction and external rotation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The stabilizing function of the deltoid muscle takes on more importance as the shoulder becomes unstable.},

  abstract = {Stress injuries represent a spectrum of injuries ranging from periostitis, caused by inflammation of the periosteum, to a complete stress fracture that includes a full cortical break. They are relatively common overuse injuries in athletes that are caused by repetitive submaximal loading on a bone over time. Stress injuries are often seen in running and jumping athletes and are associated with increased volume or intensity of training workload. Most commonly, they are found in the lower extremities and are specific to the sport in which the athlete participates. Upper extremity stress injuries are much less common than lower extremity stress injuries, but when they do occur, they are most commonly seen in the ulna. Similar to the lower extremity injuries, upper extremity stress injuries are the result of overuse and fatigue. Rib stress fractures are an uncommon site of stress injuries. First rib fractures are the most common, and these are seen in pitchers, basketball players, weightlifters, and ballet dancers. Stress fractures in ribs 4 through 9 are seen in competitive rowers, and posteromedial rib stress fractures can be seen in golfers. Stress fractures of the pelvis can be vague clinically and mimic other causes of groin and hip pain, for example, adductor strain, osteitis pubis, or sacroiliitis. The most common location is the ischiopubic ramus and sacrum. These injuries are seen most commonly in runners. Femoral neck stress fractures make up approximately 11\% of stress injuries in athletes. The patient complains of hip or groin pain which is worse with weight bearing and range of motion especially internal rotation. There are 2 types of femoral neck stress fractures: tension-type (or distraction) fractures and compression-type fractures. Tension-type femoral neck stress fractures involve the superior-lateral aspect of the neck and are at highest risk for complete fracture; thus, these should be detected early. Compression-type fractures are seen in younger athletes and involve the inferior-medial femoral neck. A trial of non-surgical management can be attempted for patients without a visible fracture line on radiographs in compression type injuries. This injury is common in runners. Stress fractures of the femoral shaft are well documented in the literature, and in one study among military recruits, they represented 22.5\% of all stress fractures. Patients typically complain of poorly localized, insidious leg pain often mistaken for muscle injury. An exam is often nonfocal, although the ``fulcrum test'' test can be used by providers to localize the affected pain and suggest the diagnosis. If there is no evidence of a cortical break on imaging, a non-surgical approach can be attempted. The patella is a rare location for a stress fracture and can be oriented either transverse or vertical. Transverse fractures are at higher risk for displacement and immobilization is recommended. Tibial stress injuries are the most common location of stress reactions and fractures. Medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), also known as shin splints or tibial periostitis, can be difficult to distinguish from medial tibial stress fractures. Typically, the patient will be tender over the medial posterior edge of the tibia often made worse with a motor exam. Stress injuries will present with pain during activities of daily living, while MTSS is generally limited to exertional activity. Anterior cortex tibial stress fractures are less common than the posteromedial ones and are found in jumping and leaping athletes. These patients may have the ``dreaded black line'' on x-ray. They are at a greater risk of nonunion and full cortical break and require aggressive conservative therapy. If that fails, surgical management such as an intramedullary rod or flexible plate is indicated. Stress fractures of the medial tibial plateau are uncommon but can be confused for meniscus injury or pes anserine bursitis, and thus, a high index of suspicion is needed. Fibular stress fractures are common and most commonly located in the lower third of the fibula, proximal to the tibiofibular ligament. Patients will have reproducible pain on palpation of the affected bone. Medial malleolus stress fractures are uncommon. Running and jumping athletes can develop vertical stress fractures at the junction of the medial malleolus and tibial plafond. If full cortical disruption is identified, surgical fixation is typically indicated. Calcaneal stress fractures present as localized tenderness over the heel of the calcaneus posterior to the talus. Patients will have a positive squeeze test. Stress fractures can develop in the navicular, medial cuneiform, and lateral process of the talus. Navicular stress fractures are difficult to diagnose early on and are at high risk of nonunion due to poor vascular flow, primarily in the middle third. These are common in basketball players and runners. They are usually tender on the navicular bone. Metatarsal stress fractures account for 9\% of all stress fractures in athletes. The second and third metatarsals are most commonly affected and are usually in the neck or distal shaft. They will be point tender with localized swelling over the affected bone. Dancers fracture is a stress fracture at the base of the second metatarsal. Stress fractures distal to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal are termed Jones fractures but must be distinguished from an acute Jones fracture. Sesamoid stress injuries of the great toe present as gradual unilateral plantar pain with the medial (tibial) sesamoid most frequently affected. Direct tenderness or pain with passive extension of the toe aid in diagnosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent developments for secondary stroke prevention include evidence to support the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy after minor stroke and transient ischemic attack, direct oral anticoagulants for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, reversal agents for direct oral anticoagulant--associated hemorrhage, and aspirin rather than presumptive anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant for embolic stroke of undetermined source.                                         SUMMARY               Most strokes are preventable. The mainstays of medical management for secondary stroke prevention include antihypertensive therapy; antithrombotic therapy, with antiplatelet agents for most stroke subtypes or anticoagulants such as warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant for cardioembolic stroke specifically; cholesterol-lowering therapy, principally with statins, but with potential roles for ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in selected patients; and glycemic control to prevent microvascular complications from diabetes mellitus or pioglitazone in selected patients with insulin resistance but not diabetes mellitus.},

  abstract = {Background:               Performance measures such as strength, jump height/length, and change of direction (CoD) time during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rehabilitation have been used to determine readiness to return to play and identify those who may be at risk of rerupture. However, athletes may reach these criteria despite ongoing biomechanical deficits when performing these tests. Combining return-to-play criteria with an assessment of movement through 3-dimensional (3D) biomechanics in male field sports athletes to identify risk factors for ACL rerupture has not been explored previously.                                         Purpose:               To prospectively examine differences in strength, jump, and CoD performance and movement using 3D biomechanics in a cohort of male athletes playing level 1 sports (ie, multidirectional field sports that involve landing, pivoting, or CoD) between those who reinjured the reconstructed ACL (RI group) and those with no reinjury (NRI group) after 2 years of follow-up and to examine the ability of these differences to predict reinjury.                                         Study Design:               Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.                                         Methods:               After primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR), 1045 male athletes were recruited and underwent testing 9 months after surgery including isokinetic strength, jump, and CoD performance measures as well as patient-reported outcomes and 3D biomechanical analyses. Participants were followed up after 2 years regarding ACL reinjury status. Differences were determined between the RI and NRI groups in patient-reported outcomes, performance measures, and 3D biomechanics on the ACLR side and symmetry between limbs. The ability of these measures to predict ACL reinjury was determined through logistic regression.                                         Results:               No differences were identified in strength and performance measures on the ACLR side or in symmetry. Biomechanical analysis indicated differences on the ACLR side primarily in the sagittal plane for the double-leg drop jump (effect size, 0.59-0.64) and greater asymmetry primarily in the frontal plane during unplanned CoD (effect size, 0.61-0.69) in the RI group. While these biomechanical test results were different between groups, multivariate regression modeling demonstrated limited ability (area under the curve, 0.67 and 0.75, respectively) to prospectively predict ACL reinjury.                                         Conclusion:               Commonly reported return-to-play strength, jump, and timed CoD performance measures did not differ between the RI and NRI groups. Differences in movement based on biomechanical measures during double-leg drop jump and unplanned CoD were identified, although they had limited ability to predict reinjury. Targeting these variables during rehabilitation may reduce reinjury risk in male athletes returning to level 1 sports after ACLR.

METHODS: A search of PubMed and SPORTDiscus databases were performed to identify movement, balance, hop/jump, or agility functional performance tests from the current peer-reviewed literature used to assess function of the hip in young, athletic subjects. RESULTS: The single-leg stance, deep squat, single-leg squat, and star excursion balance tests (SEBT) demonstrated evidence of validity and normative data for score interpretation. The single-leg stance test and SEBT have evidence of validity with association to hip abductor function. The deep squat test demonstrated evidence as a functional performance test for evaluating femoroacetabular impingement. Hop/Jump tests and agility tests have no reported evidence of reliability or validity in a population of subjects with hip pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Use of functional performance tests in the assessment of hip dysfunction has not been well established in the current literature. Diminished squat depth and provocation of pain during the single-leg balance test have been associated with patients diagnosed with FAI and gluteal tendinopathy, respectively. The SEBT and single-leg squat tests provided evidence of convergent validity through an analysis of kinematics and muscle function in normal subjects. Reliability of functional performance tests have not been established on patients with hip dysfunction. Further study is needed to establish reliability and validity of functional performance tests that can be used in a young, athletic population with hip dysfunction.

The patient usually experiences pain with apprehension and a clicking sensation inside the joint. So far, a few classification scales of shoulder instability have been made. Despite this fact, MDI is highly problematic for clinicians in diagnosis and treating.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Aim:\&lt;/b\&gt; This article presents the current trends in the conservative treatment of multidirectional instability, assess effectiveness of rehabilitation and indicates the directions of MDI research.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Material and methods:\&lt;/b\&gt; In order to find current literature and conduct a critical analysis, the following scientific database was used: Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), MEDLINE and PubMed. We chose four articles which included a comparison of conservative and operative treatment, and four which evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Results:\&lt;/b\&gt; Low quality evidence shows priority of surgical treatment over conservative treatment. The protocol developed by Watson obtains a statistically significant advantage over the Burkhead and Rockwood protocol. Discussion: The effectiveness of rehabilitation reaches different levels. Rehabilitation should last from 3 to 12 months. If rehabilitation does not achieve a sufficient effect, arthroscopic methods of reducing the volume of the articular capsule should be considered. Due to the small number of scientific reports and their quality, the obtained data should be interpreted with caution. Much further research is required to create a precise and most effective algorithm.\&lt;/br\&gt; \&lt;br\&gt;\&lt;b\&gt;Conclusion:\&lt;/b\&gt; Rehabilitation exercises play an important role in the treatment of multidirectional instability of the shoulder joint, especially when the patient has not had an injury. Exercise types and load should be dosed individually. At present, the protocol described by Watson is the most effective.\&lt;/br\&gt.},

It promotes lipid uptake and adipogenesis by increasing insulin sensitivity and adiponectin release. Later, PPAR{$\gamma$} was implicated in cardiac development and in critical conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and kidney failure. Recently, a cluster of different papers linked PPAR{$\gamma$} signaling with another superfamily, the transforming growth factor beta (TGF{$\beta$}), and its receptors, all of which play a major role in PAH and kidney failure. TGF{$\beta$} is a multifunctional cytokine that drives inflammation, fibrosis, and cell differentiation while PPAR{$\gamma$} activation reverses these adverse events in many models. Such opposite biological effects emphasize the delicate balance and complex crosstalk between PPAR{$\gamma$} and TGF{$\beta$}. Based on solid experimental and clinical evidence, the present review summarizes connections and their implications for PAH and kidney failure, highlighting the similarities and differences between lung and kidney mechanisms as well as discussing the therapeutic potential of PPAR{$\gamma$} agonist pioglitazone.},

Experts in rehabilitation content and complex interventions independently coded rehabilitation interventions. The team assessed strength of evidence. Large heterogeneity across evaluated rehabilitation programs limited conclusions. Evidence from 15 studies suggests that diverse rehabilitation programs may not differ in terms of risk of harm or outcomes of pain, strength, activities of daily living, or quality of life (all low strength of evidence). Evidence is insufficient for other outcomes. In conclusion, no differences in outcomes were found between different rehabilitation programs after THA.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

BACKGROUND: The cervical rotation lateral flexion (CRLF) test is frequently used in clinical practice to determine whether a thrust manipulation targeting the first rib should be performed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the predictive validity of the CRLF test and manual examination in determining whether patients with neck pain are likely to benefit from manipulative treatment to the first and second rib. METHODS: A physical examination incorporating the CRLF test was performed on 50 participants with neck pain followed by manipulation treatment to the first and second ribs. Clinical improvement was assessed immediately and one week after treatment. Participants who experienced at least a 30\% improvement in their Neck Disability Index (NDI) score were considered "improved." Predictive validity was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Neither the CRLF test nor manual examination were predictive of clinical improvement after manipulative treatment to the first and second rib. However, being male, of older age, and exhibiting T1 and/or T2 restricted end-feel were associated with improved neck related-disability at one-week follow-up. CONCLUSION: The CRLF test does not appear to be helpful in determining whether patients with neck pain are likely to benefit from manipulative treatment to the first and second rib. Other factors from the history and clinical examination may be more helpful when selecting manipulative treatment including age and gender and possibly the presence of T1/T2 restricted end-feel.},

  abstract = {The pace of nigrostriatal degeneration, both with regards to striatal denervation and loss of melanin and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, is poorly understood especially early in the Parkinson's disease process. This study investigated the extent of nigrostriatal degeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease at different disease durations from time of diagnosis. Brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (n=28) with post-diagnostic intervals of 1-27 years and normal elderly control subjects (n=9) were examined. Sections of the post-commissural putamen and substantia nigra pars compacta were processed for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter immunohistochemistry. The post-commissural putamen was selected due to tissue availability and the fact that dopamine loss in this region is associated with motor disability in Parkinson's disease. Quantitative assessments of putaminal dopaminergic fibre density and stereological estimates of the number of melanin-containing and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (both in total and in subregions) were performed by blinded investigators in cases where suitable material was available (n=17). Dopaminergic markers in the dorsal putamen showed a modest loss at 1 year after diagnosis in the single case available for study. There was variable (moderate to marked) loss, at 3 years. At 4 years post-diagnosis and thereafter, there was virtually complete loss of staining in the dorsal putamen with only an occasional abnormal dopaminergic fibre detected. In the substantia nigra pars compacta, there was a 50-90\% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons from the earliest time points studied with only marginal additional loss thereafter. There was only a {$\sim$}10\% loss of melanized neurons in the one case evaluated 1 year post-diagnosis, and variable (30 to 60\%) loss during the first several years post-diagnosis with more gradual and subtle loss in the second decade. At all time points, there were more melanin-containing than tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. Loss of dopaminergic markers in the dorsal putamen occurs rapidly and is virtually complete by 4 years post-diagnosis. Loss of melanized nigral neurons lags behind the loss of dopamine markers. These findings have important implications for understanding the nature of Parkinson's disease neurodegeneration and for studies of putative neuroprotective/restorative therapies.},

A Guideline Development Group systematically searched and reviewed evidence using randomised clinical trials and systematic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions and guide clinicians and patients on the content of the optimal rehabilitation protocol after ACLR.The guideline targets patients during rehabilitation after ACLR and investigates the effectiveness of the available interventions to the physiotherapist, alone or in combination (eg, exercise, modalities, objective progression criteria). Exercise interventions should be considered the mainstay of ACLR rehabilitation. However, there is little evidence on the dose-response relationship between volume and/or intensity of exercise and outcomes. Physical therapy modalities can be helpful as an adjunct in the early phase of rehabilitation when pain, swelling and limitations in range of motion are present. Adding modalities in the early phase may allow earlier pain-free commencement of exercise rehabilitation. Return to running and return to training/activity are key milestones for rehabilitation after ACLR. However, there is no evidence on which progression or discharge criteria should be used.While there is a very low level of certainty for most components of rehabilitation, most of the recommendations provided in this guideline were agreed to by expert clinicians. This guideline also highlights several new elements of ACLR management not reported previously.},

Among its prominent functions, one can mention control of neuronal and glial development, neuroprotection, and modulation of both short- and long-lasting synaptic interactions, which are critical for cognition and memory. A wide spectrum of processes are controlled by BDNF, and the sometimes contradictory effects of its action can be explained based on its specific pattern of synthesis, comprising several intermediate biologically active isoforms that bind to different types of receptor, triggering several signaling pathways. The functions of BDNF must be discussed in close relation to the stage of brain development, the different cellular components of nervous tissue, as well as the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction activated under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of BDNF on regulation of neurophysiological processes. The importance of BDNF for future studies aimed at disclosing mechanisms of activation of signaling pathways, neuro- and gliogenesis, as well as synaptic plasticity is highlighted.},

Recent studies have established the LT as an important hip stabilizer in a squatting position, particularly in patients with osseous instability. PURPOSE: This review aims to concisely present the literature on LT tendinopathy and tears in order to guide health care professionals in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on the diagnosis and surgical management of ligamentum teres tendinopathy and tears. CONCLUSIONS: The ligamentum teres is an important stabilizer to the hip joint, particularly with hip flexion and external rotation. Older age and acetabular bony pathomorphology are two of the known risk factors for LT tears. Symptoms of LT tendinopathy are largely non-specific, mimicking a wide range of other hip disorders including impingement and instability. Debridement of LT tears or reactive tissue has been reported with good outcomes, with more recent studies describing reconstruction of a completely torn, nonfunctional, or absent LT using various graft sources including synthetic grafts, autografts, and allografts.

This article provides contemporary and practical knowledge about the most common vascular myelopathies.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               New studies have provided additional information on the risk factors and impact of neurologic monitoring on perioperative spinal cord infarction. Additionally, recent publications have provided information on the impact of misdiagnosis, corticosteroid treatment, and postoperative prognosis in the treatment of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas and have discussed the outcome of patients with spinal arteriovenous malformations treated with embolization, surgery, and stereotactic radiosurgery. Finally, recent studies have provided information on the natural history and postoperative prognosis of spinal cavernous malformations and on the risk factors and surgical outcome of patients with spinal epidural hematomas.                                         SUMMARY               Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges are inherent in managing patients with vascular disorders of the spinal cord, and clinicians should have a thorough understanding of these disorders to facilitate optimal outcomes for patients with these potentially devastating illnesses. This article begins by reviewing functional vascular anatomy and subsequently describes the fundamental characteristics of both ischemic and hemorrhagic vascular myelopathies to equip clinicians with the knowledge to avoid common pitfalls.},

This great variety of injury types increases the complexity of treatment. Moreover, in recent years there has been a growing demand for the most complete restoration possible of both physical and psychological function. This is the principal objective of aftercare. Accordingly, this book focuses on a comprehensive presentation of individual injuries and their effect on function, as well as the guidelines and potential results of physical therapy treatment.

  abstract = {Agnosia is a rare disorder whereby a patient is unable to recognize and identify objects, persons, or sounds using one or more of their senses despite otherwise normally functioning senses. The deficit cannot be explained by memory, attention, language problems, or unfamiliarity with the stimuli. Usually, one of the sensory modalities is affected. For example, a patient with agnosia may not be able to~identify a cup by sight, although they may be able to~tell its color and identify it by touch by its shape and texture. It is not the same as anomia. Anomia is a naming disorder in which patients cannot name an object despite using their other sensory modalities like touch and smell.~ Classically, there are 2 forms of agnosia: apperceptive and associative. Apperceptive agnosia is a failure in recognition due to deficits in the early stages of perceptual processing. Associative agnosia is a failure in recognition despite no deficit in perception. Associative agnosia patients can typically draw, match or copy objects while apperceptive agnosia patients cannot. Types of Agnosia There are 3 main types of agnosia, based on the type of~sensation involved. 1. Visual (vision). 2. Auditory (hearing). 3. Tactile (touch). Visual Agnosia~ Visual agnosia refers to an impairment in recognizing visually presented objects, despite otherwise normal visual field, acuity, color vision, brightness discrimination, language, and memory. Patients can recognize objects using other sensory~modalities. Sometimes impairment is worse for certain types of objects, so a variety of objects should be tested to diagnose precisely. Visual agnosia is the most common and better-understood agnosia. Agnosia~is further divided into 2 subtypes: apperceptive visual agnosia and associative visual agnosia. Apperceptive visual agnosia refers to an abnormality in visual perception and discriminative process, despite the absence of elementary visual deficits. These people are unable to recognize objects, draw, or copy a figure. They cannot perceive correct forms of the object, although knowledge of the object is intact. Apperceptive visual agnosia is typically associated with lesions to the parietal, occipital cortex. Associative visual agnosia refers to difficulty with understanding the meaning of what they are seeing. They can draw or copy but do not know what they have drawn. They correctly perceive the form and know the object when tested with verbal or tactile information, but cannot identify the object. They are unable to link the fully perceived visual stimulus to prior experience to help them recognize the stimulus. Associative visual agnosia is usually associated with damage to the bilateral inferior occipitotemporal cortex. Types of Visual Agnosia:  Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize familiar faces. Patients can often identify other aspects like gender, hair, emotions. Prosopagnosia results from damage to the fusiform face area (located~in the inferior temporal cortex in the fusiform gyrus). People with apperceptive prosopagnosia cannot perceive facial expressions and cues but can recognize non-facial clues like hair and clothing. Associative prosopagnosia patients can derive some~facial information like gender and age. Mr. P~in Oliver Sack's book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat~presents a classic~case of prosopagnosia. Simultanagnosia~is the inability to recognize and sort out objects when they appear together, but they can recognize them when they appear alone. Patients are unable to perceive the overall meaning of a picture or multiple things together, although they can describe isolated elements. Two forms of simultagnosia have been described. 1. Dorsal simultagnosia: Patients cannot see more than one object at a time. For example, when presented with a~picture with a table, chair, and flower vase, they may report only one thing at a time. When their attention is diverted to the other~thing, they can then identify only that thing; other things disappear to them. They often have difficulty reading as it involves viewing more than one word at a time. They often bump into objects that are close together. Dorsal simultagnosia is typically associated with lesions in the bilateral occipitotemporal cortex. 2. Ventral simultagnosia:~These individuals also cannot identify more than one object or complex objects at one time, although they can see more than one object at a time. They are unable to perceive the whole picture as one and derive a meaning out of it. For example, in a night sky picture with stars and a full moon, they may identify the moon as a ball, unable to derive the meaning of the whole picture.~Ventral simultagnosia is associated with lesions in the left inferior occipital area. Color agnosia is the inability to identify and distinguish colors, despite intact basic color vision and brightness discrimination mechanisms. It is very difficult to diagnose this type of~agnosia as colors can only be appreciated visually. Usually, these patients have a lesion in the left occipitotemporal region of the brain. Topographical agnosia~is the inability to orient to surroundings because~of the inability~to interpret spatial information. These patients have a good memory of the layout and specifics of the places well known to them, but they are unable to navigate their way through. They are unable to use visual cues to guide them in the right direction. Associated with a lesion in the right posterior cingulate area of the brain. Finger agnosia~is a difficulty in naming and differentiating among the fingers of either hand as well the hand of others. It does not refer to the inability to identify a finger as a finger, as the name may suggest. It is a part of the constellation of symptoms often referred to as Gerstmann syndrome which includes acalculia, agraphia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation. Akinetopsia refers to the inability to perceive motion. Agnostic alexia~refers to the inability to recognize words visually. They can still write and talk without difficulty.  Auditory Agnosia:   Auditory agnosia is an inability to recognize sounds despite intact hearing. Auditory agnosias are typically associated with right side temporal lesions. Types of Auditory Agnosia:  Phonagnosia is the inability to recognize familiar voices. They can recognize words spoken by others.~It is caused by damage to certain parts of the sound association region. Verbal auditory agnosia or pure word deafness is the inability to comprehend spoken words but can read, write, and speak in a relatively normal manner. Nonverbal auditory agnosia is the inability to comprehend nonverbal sounds and noises, with sparing of speech comprehension. Amusia is the inability to recognize the music. They are unable to comprehend that certain types of sounds represent music and therefore cannot distinguish music from other sounds.  Tactile Agnosia  Tactile agnosia refers to the inability to recognize objects by touch. They can name objects by sight. Amorphognosia is the inability to identify the size and shape of objects by touch, for example, a triangle or square. Ahylognosia is the inability to identify distinctive qualities like texture and weight, for example, a piece of wood, cotton, or metal. Tactile asymbolia~is impaired recognition by touch in the absence of amorphognosia and ahylognosia. .},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of novel genetic causes for ataxia and a more comprehensive understanding of the biological pathways critical for normal cerebellar function. When these molecular pathways become dysfunctional, patients develop cerebellar ataxia. In addition, several ongoing clinical trials for Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia will likely result in novel symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies for ataxia. Antisense oligonucleotides for spinocerebellar ataxias associated with CAG repeat expansions might be a promising therapeutic strategy.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebellar ataxias include heterogeneous disorders affecting cerebellar function, leading to ataxic symptoms. Step-by-step diagnostic workups with genetic investigations are likely to reveal the underlying causes of ataxia. Some disease-specific therapies for ataxia exist, such as vitamin E for ataxia with vitamin E deficiency and thiamine for Wernicke encephalopathy, highlighting the importance of recognizing these forms of ataxia. Finally, genetic diagnosis for patients with ataxia will accelerate clinical trials for disease-modifying therapy and will have prognostic value and implications for family planning for these patients.},

Of these, the plantaris muscle is reported to present a particularly high range of morphological variations. The muscle, passing distally throughout the length of the lower leg, consists of a small muscle belly and a long, thin tendon. It originates, traditionally, on the popliteal surface of the femur and the knee joint capsule, and then inserts to the calcaneal tuberosity. It has been suggested that mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy may be caused by certain plantaris tendon morphologies. This case report describes a new anomalous plantaris tendon insertion, closely related to the Achilles tendon. It comprise four distinct insertions and one direct merge with the calcaneal tendon. The current classification should be extended to accommodate such 'rare cases' to facilitate more successful Achilles tendinopathy treatment.},

The limitations of these tests are also discussed, as they only screen for a subset of the many inborn errors of metabolism that exist.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in next-generation sequencing and the emerging use of advanced metabolomic screening have made it possible to diagnose treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are not included in current newborn screening programs. Some of these inborn errors of metabolism are especially likely to present with nonspecific neurologic phenotypes, such as epilepsy, ataxia, or intellectual disability. However, cost may be a barrier to obtaining these newer tests. It is important to keep in mind that common metabolic testing may lead to treatable diagnoses. Resources are available to guide neurologists in diagnosing genetic metabolic conditions.                                         SUMMARY               This article introduces the clinical presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that are important for neurologists to consider in patients of all ages. Inborn errors of metabolism are rare, but they can present with neurologic symptoms. Newborns are now screened for many treatable metabolic disorders, but these screening tests may miss milder presentations of treatable inborn errors of metabolism that present later in life. These patients may present to adult neurologists who may be less likely to consider metabolic genetic testing.},

The purpose of the present study was to systematically review the clinical and functional outcomes following mesenchymal stem cell application focusing on early to moderate knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: A systematic search was done using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. All Studies published between 2017 and March 2023 on patients treated with single mesenchymal stem cell injection for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis reported on clinical and functional outcomes were included. RESULTS: Twelve articles comprising 539 patients and 576 knees treated with a single intraarticular injection of MSCs for knee osteoarthritis were included in the current systematic review. In eligible studies, the reported outcomes were improved concerning patient-reported outcomes measures, knee function, pain relief, and quality of patient's life. CONCLUSION: Based on high-level evidence studies, single intraarticular injection of MSCs is a safe, reliable, and effective treatment option for Kellgren-Lawrence grade I-III knee osteoarthritis. However, the lack of homogeneity in the included studies and the variance in MSCs sources and preparations should be noted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.},

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a set of objective discharge criteria, including muscle strength and functional tests, are associated with risk of ACL graft rupture after RTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 male professional athletes who underwent an ACL reconstruction and returned to their previous professional level of sport were included. Before players returned to sport they underwent a battery of discharge tests (isokinetic strength testing at 60{$^\circ$}, 180{$^\circ$} and 300{$^\circ$}/s, a running t test, single hop, triple hop and triple crossover hop tests). Athletes were monitored for ACL re-ruptures once they returned to sport (median follow-up 646\>days, range 1-2060). RESULTS: Of the 158 athletes, 26 (16.5\%) sustained an ACL graft rupture an average of 105\>days after RTS. Two factors were associated with increased risk of ACL graft rupture: (1) not meeting all six of the discharge criteria before returning to team training (HR 4.1, 95\% CI 1.9 to 9.2, p{$\leq$}0.001); and (2) decreased hamstring to quadriceps ratio of the involved leg at 60{$^\circ$}/s (HR 10.6 per 10\% difference, 95\% CI 10.2 to 11, p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes who did not meet the discharge criteria before returning to professional sport had a four times greater risk of sustaining an ACL graft rupture compared with those who met all six RTS criteria. In addition, hamstring to quadriceps strength ratio deficits were associated with an increased risk of an ACL graft rupture.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis and subsequent total hip arthroplasty (THA) lead to damages to hip joint mechanoceptors, which in turns lead to impairments in proprioception. One of the abilities mainly affected by an altered joint proprioception is balance. The aim of this work was to investigate the balance and proprioception impairments, current assessment tools, and rehabilitation training after THA. METHODS: A systematic literature revision was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Articles reporting balance and proprioception impairments, current assessment tools, or rehabilitation interventions were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. A total of 41 articles were included, 33 discussing balance and proprioception assessment, and 8 dealing with training. Data related to type of surgical approach, type and timing of assessment protocols, assessment instrumentation, and type, volume and duration of the rehabilitation training were extracted from each study. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were of high quality, 2 of moderate quality and 8 of low-quality. Literature review showed an improvement in balance following THA in comparison with the pre-operative performance, although balance abnormalities persist up to 5\,years after surgery, with THA patients showing an increased risk for falls. Balance training is effective in all the rehabilitation phases if specifically structured for balance enhancement and consistent in training volume. It remains unclear which assessments are more appropriate for the different rehabilitation phases, and if differences exist between the different surgical procedures used for THA. Only two studies assessed proprioception. CONCLUSION: Balance and proprioception show impairments up to 5\,years after THA, increasing the risk of falls. However, patients with THA may benefit of an adequate balance training. Further research is needed to investigate the gaps in balance and proprioception assessment and training following THA surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several functional outcome scores have been proposed for the evaluation of shoulder instability. Most are multiple-item questionnaires, which can be time-consuming and difficult for patients to understand, as well as leading to lack of compliance. The Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score is a single question that has recently gained widespread acceptance based on its simplicity and correlation with more complex scoring systems. The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation of a new modified version of the SANE score, the SANE-instability score, with the Rowe score after treatment for shoulder instability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a consecutive series of 253 patients (268 shoulders) treated surgically or nonoperatively for shoulder instability between November 2017 and November 2019, for whom the Rowe and SANE-instability scores were collected before treatment and/or after treatment. The SANE-instability score was assessed with the following question: "What is the overall percent value of your shoulder if a completely stable shoulder represents 100\%?"~Correlations were tested using the Pearson~coefficient (r) and interpreted as very high (r = 0.90-1.00), high (r = 0.70-0.89), moderate (r = 0.50-0.69), low (r = 0.30-0.49), or negligible (r = 0.00-0.29). Subgroup analyses were also performed to observe correlation variations according to follow-up length (before treatment and at 6, 12, 26, 52, and 104 weeks after treatment), patient age ({$<$}20, 20-29, 30-39, or {$\geq$}40 years), and type of treatment (nonoperative or surgical). RESULTS: The overall correlation between the SANE-instability and Rowe scores was high (r = 0.85, P {$<$} .001). Subgroup analyses revealed that the correlation between the 2 scores was high before treatment (r = 0.74); moderate at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment (r = 0.66 and r = 0.57, respectively); and then high at 26, 52, and 104 weeks after treatment (r = 0.75, r = 0.75, and r = 0.78, respectively) (P {$<$} .001). The correlation was high across all types of treatment (r = 0.76-0.85), high for patients aged {$\geq$} 20 years (r = 0.80-0.86), and very high for patients aged {$<$} 20 years (r = 0.93) (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between the SANE-instability and Rowe scores before and after treatment, as well as across all patient age groups and treatments. Owing to its high simplicity, the SANE-instability score could be used as an alternative to the Rowe score for patient follow-up at various time points.},

  abstract = {Aphasia is an impairment of comprehension or formulation of language caused by damage to the cortical center for language. It can be caused by many different brain diseases and disorders; however, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is the most common reason for a person to develop aphasia. The symptoms of aphasia can range from mild impairment to complete loss of any fundamental components of language such as semantic, grammar, phonology, morphology, and syntax. The function of language is the ability to express and comprehend spoken and written words. The language area of the brain is typically located in the dominant hemisphere. These structures include Wernicke area, Broca area, and arcuate fasciculus.~The Wernicke area is located at the posterior end of the superior temporal gyrus. Its function is to process visual and auditory information, and it is the center for comprehension and planning of words. Broca area is located in the inferior frontal area and is the center for motor execution of speech and sentence formation.~Arcuate fasciculus is the neural pathway connecting Wernicke area to the Broca area.~ Specific aphasia syndromes are dependent on the location of the lesion in the brain.~In fluent aphasia, the patient can speak in sentences that sound like normal speech, but some of the words are made-up words or have some sounds that are not correct. ~People with non-fluent aphasia struggle to get words out, omit words, and speak in very short sentences. Specific non-fluent aphasia syndromes include Broca, transcortical motor, mixed transcortical, and global. Fluent aphasia syndromes include Wernicke, transcortical sensory, conduction, and anomic.},

However, some authors occasionally muddle the distinctive usage between the SD and SEM in medical literature. Because the process of calculating the SD and SEM includes different statistical inferences, each of them has its own meaning. SD is the dispersion of data in a normal distribution. In other words, SD indicates how accurately the mean represents sample data. However the meaning of SEM includes statistical inference based on the sampling distribution. SEM is the SD of the theoretical distribution of the sample means (the sampling distribution). While either SD or SEM can be applied to describe data and statistical results, one should be aware of reasonable methods with which to use SD and SEM. We aim to elucidate the distinctions between SD and SEM and to provide proper usage guidelines for both, which summarize data and describe statistical results.},

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Searches were performed on Pubmed, PEDro, and CINAHL, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients {$\geq$}18 years of age with chronic MSK pain due to CS were included. No meta-analysis was conducted, and qualitative analysis was realized. RESULTS: 15 RCTs were included. Findings were divided for diagnostic criteria (fibromyalgia-FM, chronic fatigue syndrome-CFS, low back pain-LBP, chronic spinal pain-CSP). PNE has been proposed as a single intervention or associated with other approaches, and different measures were used for the main outcomes considered. Conclusions, practice implication: PNE is effective in improving pain, disability, and psychosocial factors in patients with fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain (CLBP)-especially if associated with other therapeutic approaches-and also in patients with CFS and CSP. Overall, PNE seems to be more effective when proposed in one-to-one oral sessions and associated with reinforcement elements. However, specific eligibility criteria for chronic MSK pain due to CS are still lacking in most RCTs; therefore, for future research, it is mandatory to specify such criteria in primary studies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although death determination should be consistent among physicians and across hospitals, states, and countries to ensure that someone who is declared dead in one place would not be considered alive elsewhere, variability exists in the prerequisites, clinical evaluation, apnea testing, and use of ancillary testing to evaluate for BD/DNC. Confusion also exists about performance of an evaluation for BD/DNC in challenging clinical scenarios, such as for a patient who is on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or a patient who was treated with therapeutic hypothermia. This prompted the creation of the World Brain Death Project, which published an international consensus statement on BD/DNC that has been endorsed by five world federations and 27 medical societies from across the globe.                                         SUMMARY               The World Brain Death Project consensus statement is intended to provide guidance for professional societies and countries to revise or develop their own protocols on BD/DNC, taking into consideration local laws, culture, and resource availability; however, it does not replace local medical standards. To that end, pending publication of an updated guideline on determination of BD/DNC across the lifespan, the currently accepted medical standards for BD/DNC in the United States are the 2010 American Academy of Neurology standard for determination of BD/DNC in adults and the 2011 Society of Critical Care Medicine/American Academy of Pediatrics/Child Neurology Society standard for determination of BD/DNC in infants and children.},

Recent Findings:               Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathies have been well described for some time. Recent advances include the assessment of the incidence of peripheral neuropathy in the elderly, the recognition of the limited influence of electrodiagnostic testing on the clinical management of uncomplicated axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, the development of guidelines for treatment of painful neuropathy, the identification of risk factors predisposing patients for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, a report on the association of metabolic syndrome and idiopathic axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, and the availability of more cost-effective genetic testing for identifying inherited polyneuropathies.                                         Summary:               Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathies carry an extensive list of differential diagnoses. Diagnosis is based on detailed history, physical examination, recognition of associated neurologic and non-neurologic features, and appropriate testing. Disease-modifying treatments are lacking in many cases. Management focuses on modification of predisposing lifestyle and medical factors, rehabilitation, and pain relief.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            OBJECTIVE               Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), thrombosis of the dural sinus, cerebral veins, or both, is a rare cerebrovascular disease. Although mortality rates after CVT have declined over time, this condition can result in devastating neurologic outcomes. This article reviews the latest literature regarding CVT epidemiology, details new factors associated with the development of CVT, and describes advances in CVT treatment. It also contains a discussion of future directions in the field, including novel diagnostic imaging modalities, and potential strategies to reduce the risks associated with CVT.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               The incidence of CVT may be as high as 2 per 100,000 adults per year. It remains a difficult condition to diagnose given its variable clinical manifestations and the necessity of neuroimaging for confirmation. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a novel CVT trigger, vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), as well as an association between COVID-19 infection and CVT. Although VITT is a very rare event, timely diagnosis and treatment of CVT due to VITT likely improves patient outcomes. Direct oral anticoagulants are currently being used to treat CVT and emerging data suggest that these agents are as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists. The role of endovascular therapy to treat CVT, despite a recent clinical trial, remains unproven.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The incidence of CVT has increased, outcomes have improved, and the use of direct oral anticoagulants to treat CVT represents an important advance in the clinical care of these patients. Rates of CVT as a complication of COVID-19 vaccines using adenoviral vectors are very low ({$<$}5 per million vaccine doses administered), with the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination far outweighing the risks.},

A partly revised and simplified theory of the single-score ICC is obtained, together with an alternative and simple recipe for its use in reliability studies. Our main, practical conclusion is that in the analysis of a reliability study it is neither necessary nor convenient to start from an initial choice of a specified statistical model. Rather, one may impartially use all three single-score ICC formulas. A near equality of the three ICC values indicates the absence of bias (systematic error), in which case the classical (one-way random) ICC may be used. A consistency ICC larger than absolute agreement ICC indicates the presence of non-negligible bias; if so, classical ICC is invalid and misleading. An F-test may be used to confirm whether biases are present. From the resulting model (without or with bias) variances and confidence intervals may then be calculated. In presence of bias, both absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC should be reported, since they give different and complementary information about the reliability of the method. A clinical example with data from the literature is given.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) is a non-invasive and inexpensive therapy used to treat Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) by sequentially activating motor networks in such a way that movement and pain are unpaired. The objective of this systematic review was to critically appraise relevant data on the efficacy of GMI and its components for reducing PLP and disability in amputees. METHODS: We searched 11 electronic databases for controlled trials investigating GMI and its components in amputees with PLP from inception until February 2023. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted relevant data. Study-level data were entered using the inverse variance function of the Review Manager 5 and pooled with the random effects model. RESULTS: Eleven studies with varying risk of bias were eligible. No eligible study considered left/right judgement tasks in isolation. Studies showed no effect for imagined movements, but positive effects were seen for GMI [weighted mean difference: -21.29 (95\%CI: -31.55, -11.02), I2= 0\%] and mirror therapy [weighted mean difference: -8.55 (95\%CI: -14.74, -2.35, I2= 61\%]. A comparison of mirror therapy versus sham showed no difference [weighted mean difference: -4.43 (95\%CI: -16.03, 7.16), I2= 51\%]. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that GMI and mirror therapy may be effective for reducing PLP. However, this conclusion was drawn from a limited body of evidence, and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Therefore, rigorous, high-quality trials are needed to address the gap in the literature and inform practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background and objectives               Frozen shoulder is a common painful disease of the shoulder joint characterized by structural changes in the shoulder joint, restricting both active and passive shoulder joint activities. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) effectively improved and maintained the range of motion; however, it is not clear whether it can improve the shoulder joint structure in patients with frozen shoulder. This pilot study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) observation to assess the improvement of the local structure of the shoulder joint upon PNF treatment to elucidate a target based on structure for the treatment of frozen shoulder.                                         Materials and methods               Forty-eight patients with frozen shoulder were randomly divided into the traditional manual therapy group and the PNF technique group. Changes in the thicknesses of the coracohumeral ligament (CHL) and capsule in axillary recess (CAR) of the shoulder joint were observed via MRI upon admission and at 4 weeks after treatment. A visual analog scale (VAS) and passive shoulder range of motion (ROM) at abduction, anteflexion and external rotation position were used to evaluate the improvement of shoulder joint pain and function in the initial, mid-term, and discharge of the two groups of patients.                                         Results                                The primary outcome results shown that the PNF joint mobilization significantly reduced the thickness of the CHL (                 p                 \,=\,0.0217) and CAR (                 p                 \,=\,0.0133). Compared with simple joint mobilization, The mid-term and discharge rehabilitation assessment results showed that PNF has a better effect on shoulder pain. At the mid-term evaluation, the ROM of the PNF group was significantly better than that of the Control group in the three directions (                 p                 \,{$<$}\,0.05).                                                        Conclusion               As an adjunctive therapy, PNF can improve the shoulder joint structure of patients with frozen shoulder and is an effective treatment strategy for frozen shoulder.},

  abstract = {The Rancho Los Amigos Scale (RLAS), also known as the Ranchos Scale, is a widely accepted medical scale used to describe the cognitive and behavioral patterns found in brain injury patients as they recover from injury. It was originally developed by the head injury team at the Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey, California to assess patients emerging from a coma. It is often used in conjunction with the Glasgow Coma Scale during the initial assessment of a brain injury patient. However, unlike the Glasgow Coma Scale, it is used throughout the recovery period and not limited to the initial assessment. It takes into account a patient's state of consciousness as well as their reliance on assistance to carry out their cognitive and physical functions. The original scale consisted of eight levels, with level 1 representing the lowest level of function and level 8, the highest level of function. As a patient progresses to higher levels, they demonstrate improved cognitive and behavioral states and move toward greater independence. Individuals move through the different levels in a sequential pattern. However, the amount of time spent in each level and the maximum level achieved is variable among individuals. Individuals can also demonstrate an overlap of behaviors between two different levels and they can skip levels during their recovery. The original scale has since been revised and is known as the Rancho Los Amigos Revised Scale (RLAS-R). One of the limitations of the original eight level scale was that it did not accurately reflect the individuals with higher levels of recovery. Two more levels were added to the initial eight level Ranchos Scale to create a more comprehensive ten level scale named the Rancho Los Amigos Revised Scale (RLAS-R). Each level will be further described in detail below. Level I: No Response: Total Assistance:  No response to external stimuli ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~. Level II: Generalized Response: Total Assistance:  Responds inconsistently and non-purposefully to external stimuli. Responses are often the same regardless of the stimulus. Level III: Localized Response:~ Total Assistance:  Responds inconsistently and specifically to external stimuli. Responses are directly related to the stimulus, for example, patient withdraws or vocalizes to painful stimuli. Responds more to familiar people (friends and family) versus strangers. Level IV: Confused/Agitated: Maximal Assistance:  The individual is in a~hyperactive state with bizarre and non-purposeful behavior. Demonstrates agitated behavior that originates more from internal confusion than the external environment. Absent short-term memory.  Level V: Confused, Inappropriate Non-Agitated:~ Maximal Assistance:  Shows increase in~consistency with following and responding to simple commands. Responses are non-purposeful and random to more complex commands. Behavior and verbalization is often inappropriate, and individual appears confused and often confabulates. If action or tasks is demonstrated individual can~perform but does not initiate tasks on own. Memory is severely impaired and learning new information is difficult. Different from level IV in that individual does not demonstrate agitation to internal stimuli. However, they can show agitation to unpleasant external stimuli. Level VI: Confused,~Appropriate: Moderate~Assistance:  Able to follow simple commands consistently. Able to retain learning for familiar tasks they performed pre-injury (brushing teeth, washing face)~however unable to retain learning for new tasks. Demonstrates increased awareness of self, situation, and environment but unaware of specific impairments and safety concerns~. Responses may be incorrect secondary to memory impairments but appropriate to the situation. Level VII: Automatic, Appropriate: Minimal Assistance for Daily Living Skills:  Oriented in familiar settings. Able to perform daily routine automatically with minimal to absent confusion. Demonstrates carry over for new tasks and learning in addition to familiar tasks. Superficially aware of one's diagnosis but unaware of specific impairments. Continues to demonstrate lack of insight, decreased judgment and safety awareness. Beginning to show interest in social and recreational activities in structured settings. Requires at least minimal supervision for learning and safety purposes. Level VIII: Purposeful, Appropriate: Stand By Assistance:  Consistently oriented to person, place and time. Independently carries out familiar tasks in a non-distracting environment. Beginning to show awareness of specific impairments and how they interfere with tasks, however, requires standing by assistance to compensate. Able to use assistive memory devices to recall daily schedule. Acknowledges other's~emotional states and requires only minimal assistance to respond appropriately~. Demonstrates improvement of memory and ability to consolidate the past and future events. Often depressed, irritable and with low frustration threshold. Level IX: Purposeful, Appropriate: Stand By Assistance on Request:  Able to shift between different tasks and complete them independently. Aware of and acknowledges impairments when they interfere with tasks and able to use compensatory strategies to cope. Unable to independently anticipate obstacles that may arise secondary to impairment. With assistance able to think about consequences of actions and decisions. Acknowledges the emotional needs of others with stand by-assistance. Continues to demonstrate depression and low frustration threshold. Level X: Purposeful, Appropriate: Modified Independent~:  Able to multitask~in many different environments with extra time or devices to assist. Able to create own methods and tools for memory retention. Independently anticipates obstacles that may occur as a result of impairments and take corrective actions. Able to independently make decisions and act appropriately but may require more time or compensatory strategies. Demonstrate intermittent periods of depression and low frustration threshold when under stress. Able to appropriately interact with others in social situations.},

It also provides a brief introduction to the concept of the glymphatic system and select cellular contributors to cerebral edema.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral edema and brain compression should be treated in a tiered approach after the patient demonstrates a symptomatic indication to start treatment. All patients with acute brain injury should be treated with standard measures to optimize intracranial compliance and minimize risk of ICP elevation. When ICP monitors are used, therapies should target maintaining ICP at 22 mm Hg or less. Evidence exists that serial clinical examination and neuroimaging may be a reasonable alternative to ICP monitoring; however, clinical trials in progress may demonstrate advantages to advanced monitoring techniques. Early decompressive craniectomy and hypothermia are not neuroprotective in traumatic brain injury and should be reserved for situations refractory to initial medical interventions. Medical therapies that acutely lower plasma osmolality may lead to neurologic deterioration from osmotic cerebral edema, and patients with acute brain injury and renal or liver failure are at elevated risk.                                         SUMMARY               A tiered approach to the management of cerebral edema and brain compression can reduce secondary brain injury when implemented according to core physiologic principles. However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute brain injury is incomplete, and the conceptual framework underlying decades of clinical management may need to be revised in response to currently evolving discoveries regarding the pathophysiology of acute brain injury.},

Recent Findings:               The risk for recurrence and mortality appear to be low for neonatal and childhood stroke. Most children have relatively mild deficits, but those who have greater neurologic deficits, poststroke epilepsy, or strokes early in life are at risk for lower overall cognitive function. Stroke recurrence and long-term mortality after stroke in young adults are greater than originally thought. Cognitive impairments, depression, and anxiety are associated with higher levels of poststroke unemployment and represent targets for improved poststroke care. Poststroke care in young adults involves more than medical management. Self-reported memory and executive function impairments may be more severe than what is detected by objective measures. Assessment of possible cognitive impairments and appropriate management of psychological comorbidities are key to maximizing the long-term functional outcome of stroke survivors.                                         Summary:               Childhood and young adult stroke survivors survive for many more years than older patients with stroke. To ensure that these survivors maximize the productivity of their lives, neurologists must not only optimize medical management but also recognize that impairments in cognition and mood may be remediable barriers to long-term functional independence.},

  abstract = {Mechanical loading to the knee joint results in a differential response based on the local capacity of the tissues (ligament, tendon, meniscus, cartilage, and bone) and how those tissues subsequently adapt to that load at the molecular and cellular level. Participation in cutting, pivoting, and jumping sports predisposes the knee to the risk of injury. In this narrative review, we describe different mechanisms of loading that can result in excessive loads to the knee, leading to ligamentous, musculotendinous, meniscal, and chondral injuries or maladaptations. Following injury (or surgery) to structures around the knee, the primary goal of rehabilitation is to maximize the patient's response to exercise at the current level of function, while minimizing the risk of re-injury to the healing tissue. Clinicians should have a clear understanding of the specific injured tissue(s), and rehabilitation should be driven by knowledge of tissue-healing constraints, knee complex and lower extremity biomechanics, neuromuscular physiology, task-specific activities involving weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions, and training principles. We provide a practical application for prescribing loading progressions of exercises, functional activities, and mobility tasks based on their mechanical load profile to knee-specific structures during the rehabilitation process. Various loading interventions can be used by clinicians to produce physical stress to address body function, physical impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. By modifying the mechanical load elements, clinicians can alter the tissue adaptations, facilitate motor learning, and resolve corresponding physical impairments. Providing different loads that create variable tensile, compressive, and shear deformation on the tissue through mechanotransduction and specificity can promote the appropriate stress adaptations to increase tissue capacity and injury tolerance. Tools for monitoring rehabilitation training loads to the knee are proposed to assess the reactivity of the knee joint to mechanical loading to monitor excessive mechanical loads and facilitate optimal rehabilitation.},

MOG-associated disorders can easily be confused with other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica, but they have a distinct clinical phenotype and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Most patients with MOG-associated disorders exhibit optic neuritis, myelitis, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) alone, sequentially, or in combination; the disease may be either monophasic or relapsing. Recent case reports have continued to expand the clinical spectrum of disease, and increasingly larger cohort studies have helped clarify its pathophysiology and natural history.                                         SUMMARY               Anti--MOG-associated disorders comprise a substantial subset of patients previously thought to have other seronegative CNS diseases. Accurate diagnosis is important because the relapse patterns and prognosis for MOG-associated disorders are unique. Immunotherapy appears to successfully mitigate the disease, although not all agents are equally effective. The emerging large-scale data describing the clinical spectrum and natural history of MOG-associated disorders will be foundational for future therapeutic trials.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze outcomes of surgical and conservative treatment options for multidirectional instability (MDI). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was performed. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases using various combinations of the keywords "shoulder," "multidirectional instability," "dislocation," "inferior instability," "capsulorrhaphy," "capsular plication," "capsular shift," "glenoid," "humeral head," "surgery," and "glenohumeral," over the years 1966 to 2014 was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles describing patients with open capsular shift, arthroscopic treatment, and conservative or combined management in the setting of atraumatic MDI of the shoulder were included. A total of 861 shoulders in 790 patients was included. The median age was 24.3 years, ranging from 9 to 56 years. The dominant side was involved in 269 (58\%) of 468 shoulders, whereas the nondominant side was involved in 199 (42\%) shoulders. Patients were assessed at a median follow-up period of 4.2 years (ranging from 9 months to 16 years). Fifty-two of 253 (21\%) patients undergoing physiotherapy required surgical intervention for MDI management, whereas the overall occurrence of redislocation was seen in 61 of 608 (10\%) shoulders undergoing surgical procedures. The redislocation event occurred in 17 of 226 (7.5\%) shoulders with open capsular shift management, in 21 of 268 (7.8\%) shoulders with arthroscopic plication management, in 12 of 49 (24.5\%) shoulders undergoing arthroscopic thermal shrinkage, and in 11 of 55 (22\%) shoulders undergoing arthroscopic laser-assisted capsulorrhaphy. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic capsular plication and open capsular shift are the best surgical procedures for treatment of MDI after failure of rehabilitative management. Arthroscopic capsular plication shows results comparable to open capsular shift. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV studies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The imaging characterization of immune-mediated myelopathies and the discovery of neural autoantibodies have been crucial in improving our ability to accurately diagnose myelitis. The identification of autoantibodies directed against specific central nervous system targets has led to major improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation in myelitis. It has also allowed distinction of these myelopathy etiologies from noninflammatory etiologies of myelopathy and from multiple sclerosis and provided insight into their risk of recurrence, treatment response, and long-term clinical outcomes. Prompt recognition and appropriate testing in the setting of acute and subacute myelopathies is critical as timely administration of immunotherapy can help improve symptoms and prevent permanent neurologic disability. A patient should not be classified as having ``idiopathic transverse myelitis'' without a comprehensive evaluation for a more specific etiology. Achieving the correct diagnosis and learning to recognize noninflammatory myelitis mimics is crucial as they have therapeutic and prognostic implications.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative rehabilitation is an important component of recovery after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR), facilitating successful return to sport (RTS) by reducing risk factors for repeat injury. PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to determine the best protocol for RTS after ACLR in children. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases were searched from October 3, 2014, to November 3, 2022. The inclusion criteria were the pediatric population ({$<$}18 years old) after ACLR with clear RTS criteria and/or mean/median time to RTS. Multiligament knee injuries were excluded from this study. The methodologic quality of the included articles was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS). The highest possible score was 24 points for comparative studies (ie, a study comparing 2 protocols or more). Noncomparative studies or studies with a single protocol could score a maximum of 16 points as assessed by the MINORS score. RESULTS: The search yielded 1816 titles, and 24 were retained based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Every study was published between 2015 and 2022. Among the 24 studies included, 13 were retrospective and 11 were prospective. The mean MINORS score for the noncomparative studies was 13 of 16 (n = 23) and 23 of 24 for the comparative study (n = 1). The studies were categorized into unspecified clearance (n = 10), milestone based (n = 13), and combined time and milestone (n = 1). A total of 1978 patients (57\% female) were included in the review. The mean age at ACLR was 14.7 years. The most common endpoint used was graft rupture (0\% to 35\%). In the unspecified group, the quickest RTS was 5.8 months and the longest was 9.6 months. Statistically significant risk factors for ACL reinjury included younger age and earlier RTS. The latter was a significant contributor to graft failure for combined time-based and milestone-based RTS. In the milestone-based group, the most common criteria were {$\geq$}90\% limb symmetry measured using hamstring strength, quadriceps strength, and/or hop tests. The mean RTS time was 6.8 to 13.5 months. CONCLUSION: RTS should be delayed, when possible, especially in the younger population. A combination of quantitative tests and qualitative tests is also recommended. However, optimal RTS criteria have yet to be determined. Future prospective studies should focus on comparing the different times and milestones currently available.},

Numerous interval sport programs have been published in the literature and return to sports guidelines and criteria-based progressions for returning to sport have been published, but no such protocol exists for returning to the task of sprinting. Any field or court athlete must be able to sprint as part of his/her sport demands. Because of the absence of a specific progression, sports rehabilitation professionals lack knowledge about objective criteria to progress to sprinting as well as a progressive program to do so. Given that sports rehabilitation professionals have limited visits to complete rehabilitation or their athletes have limited financial resources to do so, it is imperative that a structured, criteria-based progression be available.

It is important to recognize dysfunction of the cauda equina quickly to minimize diagnostic delay and lasting neurologic symptoms. This article describes cauda equina anatomy and the clinical features, differential diagnosis, and management of cauda equina disorders.                                                        RECENT FINDINGS               The diagnosis of disorders of the cauda equina continues to be a challenge. If a compressive etiology is seen, urgent neurosurgical intervention is recommended. However, many people with clinical features of cauda equina dysfunction will have negative diagnostic studies. If the MRI is negative, it is important to understand the diagnostic evaluation and differential diagnosis so that less common etiologies are not missed.                                         SUMMARY               Cauda equina dysfunction most often occurs due to lumbosacral disk herniation. Nondiskogenic causes include vascular, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, and neoplastic etiologies. Urgent evaluation and surgical intervention are recommended in most cases of compressive cauda equina syndrome. Other types of treatment may also be indicated depending on the etiology.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Rates of pyomyositis have increased recently in the United States, possibly because of an increase in risk factors such as IV drug use, obesity, and diabetes. Other peripheral nervous system infections, such as diphtheria, have become more common in older patients secondary to a lack of revaccination or waning immunity. Although recommended treatment regimens for most infections remain unchanged over recent years, debate over the ideal dosing and route of administration continues for some infections such as tetanus and leprosy (Hansen disease).                                         SUMMARY               Infections of the peripheral nervous system are varied in terms of the type of infection, localization, and potential treatment. Nerve conduction studies and EMG can help determine localization, which is key to determining an initial differential diagnosis.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Tremor may be defined as an involuntary movement that is rhythmic (ie, regularly recurrent) and oscillatory (ie, rotating around a central plane) and may manifest in a variety of ways; accordingly, tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology. Consequently, the diagnosis of tremor disorders can be challenging, and misdiagnoses are common. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with straightforward approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of tremors.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Focused ultrasound thalamotomy of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is an emerging and promising therapy for the treatment of essential tremor.                                         SUMMARY               The evaluation should start with a detailed tremor history followed by a focused neurologic examination, which should attend to the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, the history and examination are used to establish whether the primary tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intention tremor) or a resting tremor. The clinician should then formulate two sets of diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which resting tremor is the predominant tremor. Among the most common of the former type are essential tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, primary writing tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Parkinson disease is the most common disorder of resting tremor. This article details the clinical features of each of these disorders, as well as those of additional tremor disorders.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. OBJECTIVES: To determine the reliability of a surface sensor measurement of clavicular motion during arm elevation and to describe 3-dimensional clavicular motion in an asymptomatic population. BACKGROUND: Abnormal scapular motion on the thorax has been implicated in shoulder pathology. Without the ability to measure clavicular motion, it is not possible to identify if abnormal scapular motions derive from the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty-nine subjects participated in the investigation, including an asymptomatic group (n = 30) and a group with a history or current symptoms of shoulder pathology (n = 9). Clavicular angles relative to the thorax were tracked with surface electromagnetic sensors on the thorax, clavicle, and humerus as subjects completed humeral flexion, scapular plane abduction, and abduction. Within-day reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients and SEM. Descriptive statistics quantified sternoclavicular joint motions for the various arm movements. RESULTS: Reliable measurements were obtained, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.93 to 0.99, and SEMs from 0.9 degrees to 1.8 degrees. Between-day reliability SEM values were generally 2 degrees to 4 degrees. During elevation of the arm, the clavicle with respect to the thorax generally undergoes elevation (11 degrees-15 degrees maximum), retraction (15 degrees-29 degrees maximum), and posterior long-axis rotation (15 degrees-31 degrees maximum), with variability between subjects and planes of motion regarding the magnitude of motion. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation approaches attempting to improve shoulder motion should benefit from improved knowledge of 3-dimensional contributions of the clavicle to normal and abnormal scapular kinematics.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Few studies have investigated the role of dietary factors on knee osteoarthritis (OA) progression. We examined the prospective association of dietary fat intake with radiographic progression of knee OA. METHODS: In the Osteoarthritis Initiative, 2,092 participants with radiographic knee OA and having baseline dietary data were followed at yearly intervals up to 48 months. Dietary intakes of fatty acids were assessed with the Block Brief Food Frequency Questionnaire. To evaluate radiographic progression of knee OA, we used quantitative joint space width (JSW) between the medial femur and tibia of the knee based on fixed-flexion posteroanterior radiographs. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to test the association between dietary fat and JSW loss over time. RESULTS: We observed significant positive relationships of total fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) intakes with JSW loss. With increasing quartiles of total fat intake, JSW decreases over 48 months were 0.26 mm, 0.27 mm, 0.31 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively (P\,=\,0.02 for trend). Similar association was observed between SFA intake and JSW loss. In contrast, higher intakes of mono- (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and higher ratio of PUFA to SFA were associated with a reduced JSW loss. CONCLUSION: High intakes of total fat and SFA may be associated with increased structural knee OA progression, while MUFA and PUFA may reduce radiographic progression. Replication of these novel findings in other prospective studies is needed to confirm if reduction in SFA intake and increase in unsaturated fat intake lead to delayed knee OA progression.},

  abstract = {Wallenberg syndrome was first described in 1808 by Gaspard Vieusseux. However, a more detailed description given in 1895 by Adolf Wallenberg~identified this condition as infarction of the lateral medulla oblongata following occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA) or Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Wallenberg syndrome is also called lateral medullary or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome. This neurological disorder is associated with various symptoms that result from damage to the lateral segment of the medulla posterior to the inferior olivary nucleus. Anatomy The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) usually originates from the vertebral artery at an average distance of approximately 16 or 17 mm below the vertebrobasilar junction. The vertebral artery, arising from the subclavian artery, is classically divided into four segments. The fourth segment of the vertebral artery gives off the PICA, the largest branch of the vertebral artery. The trunk of PICA is divided into five segments: 1. The anterior medullary segment begins at the origin of the PICA. It ends at the level of a rostrocaudal line that passes through the most prominent part of the inferior olive. 2. The lateral medullary segment extends from the level of the most prominent point of the olive to the level of the origin of the glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X), and accessory (CN XI) rootlets. 3. The tonsillomedullary segment begins where the PICA passes posterior to the CN IX-XI and ends at the midpoint of the PICA's ascent toward the roof of the fourth ventricle along the medial surface of the tonsil. 4. The telovelotonsillar segment begins where the PICA ascends to the mid-level of the medial surface of the tonsil and ends where the artery exits the fissures between the tonsil, vermis, and hemisphere to reach the suboccipital surface. 5. The cortical segment begins where the PICA leaves the groove between the vermis, tonsil, and hemisphere and includes the terminal cortical branches. The trunk of PICA gives rise to perforating, choroidal, and cortical branches. The PICA supplies the medulla, the choroid plexus, the tela choroidea of the fourth ventricle, the tonsils, the inferior vermis, and the inferior aspects of the cerebellar hemispheres.~Furthermore, the PICA mostly supplies the choroid plexus on the roof and the median opening of the fourth ventricle and~provides the majority of branches of the choroid plexus.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Both meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are common brain tumors. In many cases, these lesions are found incidentally on imaging when patients are being evaluated for a variety of symptoms and signs. While nonmalignant, these tumors are occasionally associated with significant morbidity due to location and resulting secondary symptoms. Rarely, these tumors can also transform into malignant variants. Surgical techniques allow for more complete resections with minimal complications. Significant progress is being made in understanding the molecular biology of meningioma, which may result in wider availability of targeted therapies, especially for patients who are not candidates for other therapeutic modalities. Medical therapies for secretory pituitary adenomas continue to evolve. Craniopharyngiomas are nonmalignant tumors associated with significant morbidity due to their location. Molecular subtypes exist and may respond to targeted agents. Glioneuronal tumors are low-grade neoplasms potentially cured by gross total resection; however, residual and recurrent disease may require additional therapy. Recent studies have identified potentially targetable molecular alterations in more than half of cases.                                         SUMMARY               Meningiomas and pituitary adenomas are frequently encountered in neurologic practice, and familiarity with their presentation and management is essential for a practicing neurologist. Craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas, and glioneuronal tumors are characterized by a high frequency of potentially actionable genetic alterations, and targeted therapies may eventually supplement surgical therapy of these nonmalignant tumors.},

Eleven competitive surfing athletes aged 24~{\textpm}~7~years participated, and inertial motion sensors were fixed to the anterior aspect of the feet, mid-tibial shafts, sacrum and eighth thoracic vertebrae on these athletes. Three tasks were performed landing on force plates and two tasks in a modified gymnastics set-up used for land-based aerial training. Peak landing force, resultant peak acceleration and front and rear side ankle dorsiflexion ranges of motion during landing were determined. The peak acceleration was approximately 50\% higher when performing aerial training using a mini-trampoline and landing on a soft-density foam board, compared to a similar landing off a 50~cm box. Furthermore, the ankle ranges of motion during the gymnastic type landings were significantly lower than the other landing types (P~{$\leq~$}0.05 and P~{$\leq~$}0.001), for front and rear sides, respectively. Conclusively, increased task complexity and specificity of the sport increased the tibial peak acceleration, indicating greater training load.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify, summarise and critically assess economic evaluation studies on sports injury prevention strategies. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SportDiscuss. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: The current literature was searched following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Economic analyses published since 2010 were checked for inclusion. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Level of Evidence for economic and decision analysis; underlying randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were rated according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale, and risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The quality assessment revealed limited data quality. For trial-based analysis, underlying RCTs were of good quality and had a low risk of bias. Prevention concepts for general injury reduction showed effectiveness and cost savings. Regarding specific injury types, the analysis of the studies showed that the best data are available for ankle, hamstring and anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Measures using specific training interventions were the predominant form of prevention concepts; studies investigating these concepts showed cost-effectiveness with total cost savings between {\texteuro}24.82 and {\texteuro}462 per athlete. CONCLUSION: Injury prevention strategies that were studied are cost-effective. However, estimates and outcomes vary throughout the included studies, and precluded pooling of existing data. Knowledge about the cost-effectiveness of evaluated prevention measures will help improve the acceptance and application of prevention initiatives.},

  abstract = {This study aimed at systematic documentation of lateral knee pain in a consecutive series of 1102 cruciate-substituting, guided motion total knee arthroplasties (TKA) (Journey, Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) performed in 1085 patients; 1070 knees were available for review. Follow-up time ranged from one to five years, with a mean of 2.5 years. Symptoms mimicking the well known iliotibial band (ITB) friction syndrome were observed in 77 knees (7.2\%). Initial conservative treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory medication (77 knees) and local steroid injection (35 knees). The pain persisted in 22 knees (2\%), leading to a surgical release of the iliotibial band. Other surgical interventions included revision for infection (6 knees, 0.5\%), revision for tibial component loosening (6 knees, 0.5\%), revision for tibiofemoral dislocation (3 knees, 0.3\%), revision for patellar component loosening (5 knees, 0.4\%), revision for instability (1 knee, 0.1\%) and secondary patellar resurfacing (1 knee, 0.1\%). The overall survivorship with partial or total implant revision as an endpoint was 98\%. The development of lateral knee pain in association with the use of a guided motion design can be explained by the forced posterior translation of the lateral condyle in flexion. The asymmetric cam and post mechanism, acting as a hard driver of posterior femoral translation and internal tibial rotation during flexion, does not allow for the natural kinematic variability occurring in native knees. This repetitive and forced stretching of the ITB seems to induce a painful traction syndrome in some patients.},

This article describes the neurologic complications that are commonly encountered in patients who are critically ill from medical diseases and presents strategies for their diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Chronic neurologic disability is common after critical medical illness and is a major factor in the quality of life for survivors of critical illness. Studies that carefully assessed groups of patients with general critical illness have identified a substantial rate of covert seizures, brain infarcts, muscle wasting, peripheral nerve injuries, and other neurologic sequelae that are strong predictors of poor neurologic outcomes. As the population ages and intensive care survivorship increases, critical illness--related neurologic impairments represent a large and growing proportion of the overall burden of neurologic disease.

Neurologic outcome prediction, or neuroprognostication, is a complex undertaking with many important ramifications. It allows patients with good prognoses to be supported aggressively, survive, and recover; conversely, it avoids inappropriate prolonged and costly care in those with devastating injuries.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Striving to maintain a high prediction performance during prognostic assessments encompasses acknowledging the shortcomings of this task and the challenges created by advances in medicine, which constantly shift the natural history of neurologic conditions. Embracing the unknowns of outcome prediction and the boundaries of knowledge surrounding neurologic recovery and plasticity is a necessary step toward refining neuroprognostication practices and improving the accuracy of prognostic impressions. The pillars of modern neuroprognostication include comprehensive characterization of neurologic injury burden (primary and secondary injuries), gauging cerebral resilience and estimated neurologic reserve, and tying it all together with individual values surrounding the acceptable extent of disability and the difficulties of an arduous convalescence journey.

METHODS               Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the authors conducted an exhaustive review of multiple electronic databases. Potential articles were screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two authors independently analyzed these studies using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators such as level of evidence and availability of accepted patient-reported outcomes measures. These findings were synthesized in a narrative format. A third author resolved disagreements regarding the inclusion of a study.                                         RESULTS               Twenty-one articles with I or II levels of evidence were included in the review. The authors divided the findings of the literature review into several groups: rehabilitation terminology, timing and duration of postfusion rehabilitation, the need for rehabilitation relative to surgery-related morbidity, rehabilitation's relationship to outcomes, and cognitive and psychosocial aspects of postsurgical rehabilitation. Current evidence generally supports formal rehabilitation after lumbar fusion surgery. Starting physical therapy at the 12-week postoperative mark results in better outcomes at lower cost than an earlier, 6-week start. Where available, psychosocial support improves outcomes. However, a number of the questions could not be answered with high-grade evidence. In these cases, the authors used ``best evidence available'' to make recommendations. There are many cases in which different types of caregivers use clinical terminology differently. The data supporting an optimal protocol for postfusion rehabilitation remains elusive but, using the data available, the authors have crafted recommendations and a model protocol, which is currently undergoing prospective study.                                         CONCLUSIONS               Rehabilitation has long been a common feature in the postoperative management of patients undergoing spinal fusion. Although caregivers from multiple disciplines agree that the majority of their patients will benefit from this effort, the supporting data remain sparse. In creating a model protocol for postlumbar fusion rehabilitation, the authors hope to share a starting point for future postoperative lumbar fusion rehabilitation research.},

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the effects of running on sand on running biomechanics and muscle activities. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of sand training on running mechanics in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and pronated feet? METHODS: Twenty-eight adult males with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and pronated feet were divided into two equal groups (intervention and active control groups). Participants were asked to run at a constant speed of {$\sim$}3.2~m/s over an 18~m runway, respectively. Ground reaction forces were recorded using a Bertec force plate. Muscle activities were recorded using a surface bipolar electromyography system. RESULTS: In intervention group but not control group, post-hoc analysis demonstrated significantly longer time-to-peak of impact vertical ground reaction force at post-test than that pre-test (p~=~0.047). In intervention group but not control group, post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant decreases of semitendinosus activities during push-off at post-test compared with the pre-test (p~=~0.005). SIGNIFICANCE: Sand training improved time-to-peak of ground reaction forces (e.g., time-to-peak of peak of impact vertical ground reaction force) and muscle activities (e.g., semitendinosus activities) in adult males with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and pronated feet.},

METHODS: As part of a randomized controlled trial, patients were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of TT (n = 17, mean age 71.5 {\textpm} 1.5 years, disease duration 11.6 {\textpm} 1.6 years; 70\% men) or TT + VR (n = 17, mean age 71.2 {\textpm} 1.7 years, disease duration 7.9 {\textpm} 1.4 years; 65\% men). A previously validated fMRI imagery paradigm assessed changes in neural activation pretraining and post-training. Participants imagined themselves walking in 2 virtual scenes projected in the fMRI: (1) a clear path and (2) a path with virtual obstacles. Whole brain and region of interest analyses were performed. RESULTS: Brain activation patterns were similar between training arms before the interventions. After training, participants in the TT + VR arm had lower activation than the TT arm in Brodmann area 10 and the inferior frontal gyrus (cluster level familywise error-corrected [FWEcorr] p {$<$} 0.012), while the TT arm had lower activation than TT + VR in the cerebellum and middle temporal gyrus (cluster level FWEcorr p {$<$} 0.001). Changes in fall frequency and brain activation were correlated in the TT + VR arm. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise modifies brain activation patterns in patients with PD in a mode-specific manner. Motor-cognitive training decreased the reliance on frontal regions, which apparently resulted in improved function, perhaps reflecting increased brain efficiency.},

The cardiorespiratory system is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and energy substrates to the brain. Therefore, diseases of the heart and lungs can lead to various neurologic illnesses. This article reviews various cardiac and pulmonary pathologies that can lead to neurologic injury and discusses the relevant pathophysiologic mechanisms.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               We have lived through unprecedented times over the past 3 years with the emergence and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the effects of COVID-19 on the lungs and heart, an increased incidence of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and stroke associated with cardiorespiratory pathologies has been observed. Newer evidence has questioned the benefit of induced hypothermia in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Further, global collaborative initiatives such as the Curing Coma Campaign are underway with the goal of improving the care of patients with coma and disorders of consciousness, including those resulting from cardiac and pulmonary pathologies.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The neurologic complications of cardiorespiratory disorders are common and present in various forms such as stroke or hypoxic and anoxic injury related to cardiac or respiratory failure. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, neurologic complications have increased in recent years. Given the intimate and interdependent dynamics of the heart, lungs, and brain, it is crucial for neurologists to be aware of the interplay between these organs.},

Recent Findings:               Fabry disease causes early-onset stroke, particularly of the vertebrobasilar system; enzyme replacement therapy should be considered in affected patients. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, causes migraines, early-onset lacunar strokes, and dementia. Moyamoya disease can cause either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; revascularization is recommended in some patients. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy causes both microhemorrhages and macrohemorrhages, resulting in typical stroke symptoms and progressive dementia. Pregnancy raises the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in women with preeclampsia/eclampsia. Pregnant women are also at risk for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Experts recommend that pregnant women with acute ischemic stroke not be systematically denied the potential benefits of IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.                                         Summary:               Neurologists should become familiar with these uncommon causes of stroke to provide future risk assessment and family counseling and to implement appropriate treatment plans to prevent recurrence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An accurate and specific diagnosis prevents the recurrences of low back pain and chronic spinal pain. The physical examination is the most useful tool to diagnosis. The examiner must aim to determine the exact tissue that pain arises from to make the specific diagnosis. Lumbar disc herniation is 1 disease that physical examination, symptoms, and findings on imaging technique do not always correlate with each other. The Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test has been used as the primary test to diagnosis lumbar disc herniations and found to have high correlation with findings on operation since its sensitivity is high in only disc herniations leading to root compression that may eventually need operation. More sensitive test, like the Slump, might be used in herniations in which the SLR is negative. The Slump test is really a variant of the SLR and the Las{\`e}gue's tests performed in the seated position and is a progressive series of maneuvers designed to place the sciatic nerve roots under increasing tension. At each step in the procedure, the patient informs the examiner what is being felt and whether radicular pain is produced. As a result, the Slump test applies traction to the nerve roots by incorporating spinal and hip joint flexion into the leg raising and would warn the examiner of the presence of nerve root compression when there is a negative SLR test. OBJECTIVES: This study measured the sensitivity and specificity of the Slump test and compare it with the SLR test in patients with and without lumbar disc herniations. METHODS: A prospective case control study of 75 patients with complaints suggestive of lumbar disc herniation was carried out in the outpatient clinics of the neurosurgery department of a state teaching hospital. Seventy-five referred or self-admitted patients with low back, leg, or low back and leg pain who had results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine were included in the study. Thirty-eight patients had signs of herniation demonstrated by MRI. Control patients (n = 37) had no disc bulges or herniations on MRI. Both the Slump and SLR tests were performed during the assessment of all the patients by the second author. The MRI results were assessed and recorded by the first author. RESULTS: The Slump test was found to be more sensitive (0.84) than the SLR (0.52) in the patients with lumbar disc herniations. However, the SLR was found to be a slightly more specific test (0.89) than the Slump test (0.83). CONCLUSION: The Slump test might be used more frequently as a sensitive physical examination tool in patients with symptoms of lumbar disc herniations. In contrast, owing to its higher specificity, the SLR test may especially help identify patients who have herniations with root compression requiring surgery.},

The progression is often indolent, laboratory results commonly fail to reveal an underlying infectious process and radiographs changes are seen after 7 days. We discuss the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of calcaneal osteomyelitis which can result in long-term sequelae in the pediatric patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old white boy presented to our institution with heel pain and an inability to weight bear. There was a 10-day delay in diagnosis of calcaneal osteomyelitis, with a total of three presentations to our emergency department. The condition was misdiagnosed as Sever's disease on two separate occasions with discharge home. On his third presentation the diagnosis was finally clinched when he developed more definitive signs and symptoms, with pyrexia and signs of lymphangitis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse osteomyelitis of his calcaneum. He underwent surgery and 2 weeks of antibiotics administered intravenously, followed by 4 weeks of oral therapy. We are happy to report a good recovery without any complications at his 12-month follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should include calcaneal osteomyelitis as a differential in any child presenting with heel pain. Delays in the diagnosis can result in disastrous complications in the pediatric patient, such as growth arrest.},

This study's purpose was to survey clinicians on BFR use in people with neurologic conditions. [Participants and Methods] One-hundred twelve physical therapists and other healthcare professionals who reported using BFR in the past 5\>years completed an anonymous, online survey. [Results] Eighty-nine percent of respondents thought BFR was safe in people with neurologic conditions. Meanwhile, 38\% reported BFR use in people with neurologic conditions. The most common intervention used with BFR was resistance training (n=33) and the most commonly reported benefit was improved strength (n=27). The most common side-effect causing treatment to stop was intolerance to pressure (n=6). No side-effects requiring medical attention were reported. In order to support future BFR use in neurologic populations, the most common response was the need for more research (n=63). [Conclusion] Despite the lack of evidence, clinical use of BFR in people with neurologic conditions may be somewhat common. Although this study had a relatively small sample size and collected data retrospectively, the results support the potential clinical feasibility and safety of BFR use in patients with neurologic conditions and suggest that more research is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to investigate the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) for measuring mobility-related goals in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Data from 32 participants with MS who underwent 8 to 10 weeks of rehabilitation were analyzed (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores 1.0-7.0). For the PSFS, participants identified 3 mobility-related areas where they had difficulty and rated them at baseline, 10 to 14 days later (before starting intervention), and immediately after intervention. Test-retest reliability and response stability of the PSFS were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2,1 ) and minimal detectable change (MDC 95 ), respectively. Concurrent validity of the PSFS was determined with the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) and the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25FW). PSFS responsiveness was determined using Cohen's d , and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was calculated based on patient-reported improvements on a Global Rating of Change (GRoC) scale. RESULTS: The PSFS total score demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC 2,1 = 0.70, 95\% CI: 0.46 to 0.84) and the MDC was 2.1 points. At baseline, the PSFS was fairly and significantly correlated with the MSWS-12 ( r = -0.46, P = 0.008) but not with the T25FW. Changes in the PSFS were moderately and significantly correlated with the GRoC scale ({$\rho$} = 0.63, P {$<$} 0.001), but not with MSWS-12 or T25FW changes. The PSFS was responsive ( d = 1.7), and the MCID was 2.5 points or more to identify patient-perceived improvements based on the GRoC scale (sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.76). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure in people with MS to assess mobility-related goals.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A423 ).},

RECENT FINDINGS               The classification of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies has improved with the integration of myositis-specific antibodies and histopathologic findings. Characteristic features of immune checkpoint inhibitor--related myositis have been identified, allowing early recognition and treatment of the syndrome. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the care of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and several mechanisms of virus-related muscle injury have been proposed.                                         SUMMARY               A comprehensive evaluation including clinical examination, EMG, imaging, antibody testing, muscle biopsy, and cancer screening, when appropriate, can lead to an earlier accurate diagnosis and an individualized treatment approach for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.},

The thoracic spine is most commonly involved, although involvement can include the thoracolumbar/lumbar region as well . Most commonly, diagnosis is made in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who present after their parents notice a postural deformity or ``hunchbacked'' appearance. Pain in the affected hyperkyphotic region may also be the cause of initial evaluation . There is a hereditary component associated with this condition, although the exact mode of transmission is still unclear.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Intolerance to various foods, excluding bona fide coeliac disease and lactose intolerance, represents a growing cause of patient visits to allergy clinics.Histamine intolerance is a long-known, multifaceted clinical condition triggered by histamine-rich foods and alcohol and/or by drugs that liberate histamine or block diamine oxidase (DAO), the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of ingested histamine. Histamine limitation diets impose complex, non-standardized restrictions that may severely impact the quality of life of patients. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 14 patients who visited allergy outpatient facilities in northern Italy with a negative diagnosis for IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity, coeliac disease, conditions related to gastric hypersecretion, and systemic nickel hypersensitivity, and who previously underwent a histamine limitation diet with benefits for their main symptoms. Serum diamine oxidase levels and the clinical response to diamine oxidase supplementation were investigated. RESULTS: We found that 10 out of 14 patients had serum DAO activity{$<$}10 U/mL, which was the threshold suggested as a cutoff for probable histamine intolerance. Moreover, 13 out of 14 patients subjectively reported a benefit in at least one of the disturbances related to food intolerances following diamine oxidase supplementation. The mean value ({\textpm}SD) of diamine oxidase activity in the cohort of patients with histamine intolerance symptoms was 7.04{\textpm}6.90 U/mL compared to 39.50{\textpm}18.16 U/mL in 34 healthy controls (P=0.0031). CONCLUSION: In patients with symptoms triggered by histamine-rich food, measuring the serum diamine oxidase activity can help identify subjects who can benefit from a histamine limitation diet and/or diamine oxidase supplementation.Properly designed, controlled studies investigating histamine intolerance that include histamine provocation are indispensable for providing insights into the area of food intolerances, which are currently primarily managed with non-scientific approaches in Italy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether fear of re-injury is manifested in joint kinematics and muscle activation patterns during landings of a standardized rebound side-hop (SRSH), or in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), among individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, 38 individuals within 2 years post-ACLR were grouped into HIGH-FEAR (n = 21, median 11.2 months post-surgery) or LOW-FEAR (n = 17, median 10.1 months post-surgery) based on a discriminating question (Q9; Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-17). These individuals and 39 asymptomatic controls performed the SRSH. Three-dimensional motion recordings were used to calculate trunk, hip, and knee joint angles at initial contact and range of respective joint motion during landing. Surface electromyography registered mean amplitudes and co-contraction indexes for thigh muscles during pre-activation (50 ms) and landing phases. PROMs of knee function, knee health, and physical activity were also analyzed. RESULTS: The HIGH-FEAR and LOW-FEAR classification was corroborated by distinct Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-17 total and subscale scores and revealed distinguishable muscle activation patterns. HIGH-FEAR demonstrated higher biceps femoris electromyography amplitude and higher anterior-posterior co-contraction index during landing than both LOW-FEAR and controls. However, there were no fear-related differences for kinematics or PROMs. Instead, both ACLR subgroups showed different kinematics at initial contact to controls; HIGH-FEAR with more trunk, hip, and knee flexion, and LOW-FEAR with more hip and knee flexion. CONCLUSION: Individuals with ACLR who had high fear of re-injury seem to have adopted a protective strategy with higher muscular activation patterns, presumably to stabilize the knee joint, compared with individuals with low fear of re-injury and controls. SRSH landing kinematics or knee-related PROMs may not be as sensitive to fear of re-injury. IMPACT: Fear of reinjury following anterior cruciate ligament injury should be evaluated as an independent psychological outcome throughout rehabilitation after ACLR for improved return to sport transition. LAY SUMMARY: If you have an anterior cruciate ligament injury treated with reconstructive surgery, you might have a high fear of reinjury, and that can change how you activate the muscles around your knee. Your physical therapist can do a simple screening test in addition to functional tests to help reduce your fear and improve your treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Energy flow has been hypothesized to be one of the most critical biomechanical concepts related to tennis performance and overuse injuries. However, the relationships among energy flow during the tennis serve, ball velocity, and overuse injuries have not been assessed. PURPOSE: To investigate the relationships among the quality and magnitude of energy flow, the ball velocity, and the peaks of upper limb joint kinetics and to compare the energy flow during the serve between injured and noninjured tennis players. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The serves of expert tennis players were recorded with an optoelectronic motion capture system. The forces and torques of the upper limb joints were calculated from the motion captures by use of inverse dynamics. The amount of mechanical energy generated, absorbed, and transferred was determined by use of a joint power analysis. Then the players were followed during 2 seasons to identify upper limb overuse injuries with a questionnaire. Finally, players were classified into 2 groups according to the questionnaire results: injured or noninjured. RESULTS: Ball velocity increased and upper limb joint kinetics decreased with the quality of energy flow from the trunk to the hand + racket segment. Injured players showed a lower quality of energy flow through the upper limb kinetic chain, a lower ball velocity, and higher rates of energy absorbed by the shoulder and elbow compared with noninjured players. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study imply that improper energy flow during the tennis serve can decrease ball velocity, increase upper limb joint kinetics, and thus increase overuse injuries of the upper limb joints.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the process and outcomes of using a new evidence base to develop scientific guidelines that specify the type and minimum dose of exercise necessary to improve fitness and cardiometabolic health in adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: International. METHODS: Using Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II reporting criteria, steps included (a) determining the guidelines' scope; (b) conducting a systematic review of relevant literature; (c) holding three consensus panel meetings (European, Canadian and International) to formulate the guidelines; (d) obtaining stakeholder feedback; and (e) process evaluation by an AGREE II consultant. Stakeholders were actively involved in steps (c) and (d). RESULTS: For cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength benefits, adults with a SCI should engage in at least 20\,min of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise 2 times per week AND 3 sets of strength exercises for each major functioning muscle group, at a moderate to vigorous intensity, 2 times per week (strong recommendation). For cardiometabolic health benefits, adults with a SCI are suggested to engage in at least 30\,min of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise 3 times per week (conditional recommendation). CONCLUSIONS: Through a systematic, rigorous, and participatory process involving international scientists and stakeholders, a new exercise guideline was formulated for cardiometabolic health benefits. A previously published SCI guideline was endorsed for achieving fitness benefits. These guidelines represent an important step toward international harmonization of exercise guidelines for adults with SCI, and a foundation for developing exercise policies and programs for people with SCI around the world.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to quantify kinematic, kinetic and performance changes that occur in the serve throughout a prolonged tennis match play. Serves of eight male advanced tennis players were recorded with a motion capture system before, at mid-match, and after a 3-hour tennis match. Before and after each match, electromyographic data of 8 upper limb muscles obtained during isometric maximal voluntary contraction were compared to determine the presence of muscular fatigue. Vertical ground reaction forces, rating of perceived exertion, ball speed, and ball impact height were measured. Kinematic and upper limb kinetic variables were computed. The results show decrease in mean power frequency values for several upper limb muscles that is an indicator of local muscular fatigue. Decreases in serve ball speed, ball impact height, maximal angular velocities and an increase in rating of perceived exertion were also observed between the beginning and the end of the match. With fatigue, the majority of the upper limb joint kinetics decreases at the end of the match. No change in timing of maximal angular velocities was observed between the beginning and the end of the match. A prolonged tennis match play may induce fatigue in upper limb muscles, which decrease performance and cause changes in serve maximal angular velocities and joint kinetics. The consistency in timing of maximal angular velocities suggests that advanced tennis players are able to maintain the temporal pattern of their serve technique, in spite of the muscular fatigue development.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Pediatric presentations of sleep disorders differ from adult presentations, making diagnosis challenging. Specific clinical syndromes, such as cataplexy in children with narcolepsy type 1, can have an altogether different presentation compared to adult-onset symptoms, contributing to diagnostic delays and potential misdiagnoses. More broadly, research shows strong associations between sleep and daytime cognition, mood, and behavior among children with and without neurologic conditions and thus suggests a need to identify and treat sleep problems to optimize daytime functioning.

OBJECTIVES: To explore therapists' perceptions of useful diagnostic criteria to identify first rib dysfunction. METHODS: A Delphi survey over four rounds involving~international manual therapy experts~who were asked to agree on which items were most useful in identifying first rib dysfunction. RESULTS: Consensus ({$>$}70\% agreement)~was reached on key aspects of first rib dysfunction being first rib mobility restriction, upper limb symptom distribution, and a subclassification into two subgroups was suggested. The main clinical findings suggested were: painful and restricted neck movements and shoulder girdle loading activities; positive~Upper Limb Neural Test 1;~direct palpation of first rib, neural structures, and scalene muscles; pain and hypomobility of first rib accessory movements with improvement after mobilization. The~cervical rotation lateral-flexion test was considered a useful, although not widely used test among~the experts. Its diagnostic accuracy~and interpretation in isolation~was questioned.

Collagen, a key component of the extracellular matrix, plays critical roles in the regulation of the phases of wound healing either in its native, fibrillar conformation or as soluble components in the wound milieu. Impairments in any of these phases stall the wound in a chronic, non-healing state that typically requires some form of intervention to guide the process back to completion. Key factors in the hostile environment of a chronic wound are persistent inflammation, increased destruction of ECM components caused by elevated metalloproteinases and other enzymes and improper activation of soluble mediators of the wound healing process. Collagen, being central in the regulation of several of these processes, has been utilized as an adjunct wound therapy to promote healing. In this work the significance of collagen in different biological processes relevant to wound healing are reviewed and a summary of the current literature on the use of collagen-based products in wound care is provided.},

Guidance for effectively identifying obsessive-compulsive symptoms is provided, and treatment options, including psychotherapy, pharmacologic management, and neuromodulation approaches for treatment-resistant OCD, are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                OCD affects 2\% to 3\% of adults worldwide and is associated with substantial individual disability and societal costs. Lack of recognition of common OCD symptom types, in addition to shame and fear of stigma on the part of patients, has created an average delay in diagnosis by almost 10 years and a delay in effective treatment (ie, a treatment gap) of nearly 2 years. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), specifically a form of CBT that includes a type of behavioral intervention called                 exposure and response prevention                 , remains the most effective form of treatment for OCD. If CBT is not effective or not available, pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or clomipramine, a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can also be of benefit. Neuromodulation approaches such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation are rapidly emerging as effective treatments for OCD, particularly for patients who have not experienced an adequate response to psychotherapy or pharmacologic management.                                                        SUMMARY               OCD affects more than one in every 50 adults in the United States but is recognized and adequately treated in fewer than half of those affected. Early intervention and appropriate treatment can substantially reduce OCD symptom severity, improve quality of life, and minimize the functional disability associated with this chronic and often debilitating illness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inspite of common lifting advice to maintain a lordotic posture, there is debate regarding optimal lumbar spine posture during lifting. To date, the influence of lumbar posture on trunk muscle recruitment, strength and efficiency during high intensity lifting has not been fully explored. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do differences in lumbar posture influence trunk extensor strength (moment), trunk muscle activity, and neuromuscular efficiency during maximal lifting? METHODS: Twenty-six healthy participants adopted three lumbar postures (maximal extension (lordotic), mid-range (flat-back), and fully flexed) in a free lifting position. Motion analysis and force measurements were used to determine the back extensor, hip and knee moments. Surface electromyography (EMG) of three trunk extensors and the internal obliques were recorded. Neuromuscular efficiency (NME) was expressed as a ratio of normalised extensor moment to normalised EMG. RESULTS: Significantly higher back extensor moments were exerted when moving from an extended to mid-range, and from a mid-range to fully flexed lumbar posture. This was accompanied by a decrease in activity across all three back extensor muscles (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) resulting in a higher NME of these muscles in more flexed postures. Change in lumbar posture did not influence hip or knee moments or internal oblique activation. SIGNIFICANCE: A flexed-back posture is associated with increased strength and efficiency of the back muscles compared to a lordotic posture. These findings further question the manual handling advice to lift with a lordotic lumbar spine.},

Central to their function is their ability to be recruited to sites of infection, to recognize and phagocytose microbes, and then to kill pathogens through a combination of cytotoxic mechanisms. These include the production of reactive oxygen species, the release of antimicrobial peptides, and the recently discovered expulsion of their nuclear contents to form neutrophil extracellular traps. Here we discuss these primordial neutrophil functions, which also play key roles in tissue injury, by providing details of neutrophil cytotoxic functions and congenital disorders of neutrophils. In addition, we present more recent evidence that interactions between neutrophils and adaptive immune cells establish a feed-forward mechanism that amplifies pathologic inflammation. These newly appreciated contributions of neutrophils are described in the setting of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is crucial for safe return to play (RTP) and reducing the chances of a reinjury. Yet, there is no consensus on the ideal functional tests to assess rehabilitation progress in soccer players after ACLR. PURPOSE: The primary objective was to highlight the existing gap in the literature concerning the most effective standardized rehabilitation protocols and testing for facilitating successful RTP among soccer players. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A systematic review using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) was conducted. Inclusion criteria encompassed original studies (level of evidence 1-4) that examined rehabilitation protocols, metrics of knee rehabilitation, and clinical outcomes after ACLR in soccer players. RESULTS: This review incorporated 23 studies, predominantly retrospective case series, with a total number of 874 soccer players who underwent ACLR and rehabiliation. 5 (21.7\%) studies utilized an accelerated rehabilitation protocol, while 7 (30.4\%) of studies utilized a criterion-based rehabilitation. A wide heterogeneity of data was extracted including functional tests of rehabilitation and RTP such as strength test batteries, hop test batteries, and movement quality assessments. Of the 23 selected studies, 2 (8.7\%) used all 3 test batteries, 8 (34.8\%) used 2 test batteries, 12 (52.2\%) used 1 test battery, and 1 (4.3\%) used 0 of the test batteries. The mean time between surgery and RTP ranged from 3 to 8 months with only 2 (8.7\%) studies reporting complications after ACLR. Lastly, out of the total studies examined, 9 (39.1\%) assessed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), all of which demonstrated significant improvement from the initial assessment to the final follow up. CONCLUSION: Soccer-specific rehabilitation after ACLR lacks standardization. Even though many studies have assessed protocols for optimal RTP and reduced secondary ACL injuries, there is a gap in the literature regarding the most effective protocols and RTP testing. The methodology reported by Kyritsis et al could serve as a foundation for future prospective randomized multicenter studies to establish a standard rehabilitation protocol and enable a successful return to soccer.},

  abstract = {Prospective and retrospective studies have examined traumatic injuries within competitive and recreational surfers worldwide using online surveys and health care facility (HCF; e.g., hospital, emergency department, medical record) data. However, few studies have provided a synthesis of all available literature. The purpose of this study was to obtain, critique and synthesise all literature specific to acute surfing injuries, and evaluate differences in injury type, mechanism and location between HCF and survey data. A systematic literature review design was used to identify relevant articles from three major databases. Peer-reviewed epidemiological studies of musculoskeletal surfing injuries were included. A modified AXIS tool was used for critical appraisal, and objective data was extracted and synthesized by lead researchers. Overall frequencies for injury location, type and mechanism were calculated from raw injury data. A total of 19 cross-sectional articles of fair to good quality (Modified AXIS 54.2-83.3\%) were included in this study; 17 were National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) level III-2 (retrospective) and two were level II (prospective). Articles examined competitive, recreational and combined populations. Injury data from Australia, Brazil, UK, USA, Portugal, Japan, Norway, and worldwide were represented. Skin (46.0\%; HCF 50.1\%, survey 43.8\%) and being struck by own surfboard (38.6\%; HCF 73.4\%, survey 36.7\%) were the most common injury type and mechanism. Head, face and neck injuries were most common in HCF (43.1\%) versus lower limb injuries (36.4\%) in survey data. Incidence proportion was highest in aerialists (0.48). Incidence rate (number of injuries per 1000 h) ranged from 0.74 in Australian surfers (Melbourne) to 6.6 in international contest surfers from medical record data. This review highlights the prevalence of skin, board-related, head, face and neck, and lower limb surfing injuries across available literature. Proposed use of protective equipment and foam-based surfboards in dangerous or crowded surf locations may reduce injury risk.},

Traditionally, diagnostic categories are based on a pathoanatomic medical model aimed at identifying the pathologic tissues. However, the pathoanatomic model may not provide diagnostic categories that effectively guide treatment decision making in rehabilitation. An expanded classification system is proposed that includes the pathoanatomic diagnosis and a rehabilitation classification based on tissue irritability and identified impairments. For the rehabilitation classification, 3 levels of irritability are proposed and defined, with corresponding strategies guiding intensity of treatment based on the physical stress theory. Common impairments are identified and are used to guide specific intervention tactics with varying levels of intensity. The proposed system is conceptual and needs to be tested for reliability and validity. This classification system may be useful clinically for guiding rehabilitation intervention and provides a potential method of identifying relevant subgroups in future research studies. Although the system was developed for and applied to shoulder disorders, it may be applicable to classification and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal disorders in other body regions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effects of concussion on mental status are often difficult to assess on routine clinical examination. I investigated the efficacy of standardized mental status testing on the sport sideline to detect abnormalities that result from concussion and provide an objective measure of postinjury cognitive recovery. DESIGN AND SETTING: All subjects underwent a standardized preseason baseline mental status evaluation. Standardized testing of injured and uninjured control subjects was repeated on the sideline immediately after concussion and 48 hours after injury. SUBJECTS: Sixty-three high school and collegiate football players with concussion and 55 uninjured control subjects were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) was administered to evaluate neurocognitive functioning and neurologic status. RESULTS: Immediately after concussion, injured subjects performed significantly below preinjury baseline and below uninjured controls on the SAC. Measurable deficits in orientation, concentration, and memory were evident immediately after concussion. A decline in SAC score at time of injury was 95\% sensitive and 76\% specific in accurately classifying injured and uninjured subjects on the sideline. Injured subjects demonstrated significant improvements in SAC score 48 hours after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized mental status testing can be a valuable tool to assist the sports medicine clinician in detecting the immediate effects of concussion on mental status, tracking resolution of immediate postconcussive mental status abnormalities, and making more informed decisions on return to play after injury.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in fluid (CSF and blood-based) and imaging biomarkers are allowing for a more precise and earlier diagnosis of AD (relative to non-AD dementias) across the disease spectrum and in patients with atypical clinical features. Specifically, tau- and amyloid-related AD pathologic changes can now be measured by CSF, plasma, and positron emission tomography (PET) with good precision. Additionally, a better understanding of risk factors for AD has highlighted the need for clinicians to address comorbidities to maximize prevention of cognitive decline in those at risk or to slow decline in patients who are symptomatic. Recent clinical trials of amyloid-lowering drugs have provided not only some optimism that amyloid reduction or prevention may be beneficial but also a recognition that addressing additional targets will be necessary for significant disease modification.                                         SUMMARY               Recent developments in fluid and imaging biomarkers have led to the improved understanding of AD as a chronic condition with a protracted presymptomatic phase followed by the clinical stage traditionally recognized by neurologists. As clinical trials of potential disease-modifying therapies continue, important developments in the understanding of the disease will improve clinical care now and lead to more effective therapies in the near future.},

The low back is the most common injury sustained whilst playing golf, and the dynamic action of the golf swing is a major contributing factor to injury. The golf swing is a complex movement that utilises the whole body in a coordinated fashion and when repeated frequently can result in injury. Injury can be overuse or traumatic in nature. Overuse injuries predominate in the professional golfer, and amateur golfer injury tends to occur secondary to an incorrect golf swing. Upper limb injuries are also common due to their role in linking the fast moving golf club with the power-generating torso. Fortunately, injury from a club or ball strike is rare. More common are the overuse injuries associated with the back, neck and shoulder. Most golf injury data have been collected retrospectively and further epidemiological study of a prospective nature is required to determine injury incidence and factor relating to the onset of injury.},

  abstract = {The Chi-square statistic is a non-parametric (distribution free) tool designed to analyze group differences when the dependent variable is measured at a nominal level. Like all non-parametric statistics, the Chi-square is robust with respect to the distribution of the data. Specifically, it does not require equality of variances among the study groups or homoscedasticity in the data. It permits evaluation of both dichotomous independent variables, and of multiple group studies. Unlike many other non-parametric and some parametric statistics, the calculations needed to compute the Chi-square provide considerable information about how each of the groups performed in the study. This richness of detail allows the researcher to understand the results and thus to derive more detailed information from this statistic than from many others. The Chi-square is a significance statistic, and should be followed with a strength statistic. The Cramer's V is the most common strength test used to test the data when a significant Chi-square result has been obtained. Advantages of the Chi-square include its robustness with respect to distribution of the data, its ease of computation, the detailed information that can be derived from the test, its use in studies for which parametric assumptions cannot be met, and its flexibility in handling data from both two group and multiple group studies. Limitations include its sample size requirements, difficulty of interpretation when there are large numbers of categories (20 or more) in the independent or dependent variables, and tendency of the Cramer's V to produce relative low correlation measures, even for highly significant results.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

  abstract = {Found in all vertebrates, creatine kinase catalyzes the reversible reaction of creatine and ATP forming phosphocreatine and ADP. Phosphocreatine may be viewed as a reservoir of "high-energy phosphate" which is able to supply ATP, the primary energy source in bioenergetics, on demand. Consequently, creatine kinase plays a significant role in energy homeostasis of cells with intermittently high energy requirements. The enzyme is of clinical importance and its levels are routinely used as an indicator of myocardial and skeletal muscle disorders and for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. First identified in 1928, the enzyme has undergone intensive investigation for over 75 years. There are four major isozymes, two cytosolic and two mitochondrial, which form dimers and octamers, respectively. Depending on the pH, the enzyme operates by a random or an ordered bimolecular mechanism, with the equilibrium lying towards phosphocreatine production. Evidence suggests that conversion of creatine to phosphocreatine occurs via the in-line transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP. A recent X-ray structure of creatine kinase bound to a transition state analog complex confirmed many of the predictions based on kinetic, spectroscopic, and mutagenesis studies. This review summarizes and correlates the more significant mechanistic and structural studies on creatine kinase.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In high-stakes assessments in medical education, such as final undergraduate examinations and postgraduate assessments, an attempt is frequently made to set confidence limits on the probable true score of a candidate. Typically, this is carried out using what is referred to as the standard error of measurement (SEM). However, it is often the case that the wrong formula is applied, there actually being three different formulae for use in different situations. AIMS: To explain and clarify the calculation of the SEM, and differentiate three separate standard errors, which here are called the standard error of measurement (SEmeas), the standard error of estimation (SEest) and the standard error of prediction (SEpred). RESULTS: Most accounts describe the calculation of SEmeas. For most purposes, though, what is required is the standard error of estimation (SEest), which has to be applied not to a candidate's actual score but to their estimated true score after taking into account the regression to the mean that occurs due to the unreliability of an assessment. A third formula, the standard error of prediction (SEpred) is less commonly used in medical education, but is useful in situations such as counselling, where one needs to predict a future actual score on an examination from a previous actual score on the same examination. CONCLUSIONS: The various formulae can produce predictions that differ quite substantially, particularly when reliability is not particularly high, and the mark in question is far removed from the average performance of candidates. That can have important, unintended consequences, particularly in a medico-legal context.},

There is limited research available comparing the presence of examination findings among individuals with PPCS from different age groups. METHODS: Retrospective case-control chart review of 481 patients with PPCS and 271 non-trauma controls. Physical assessments were categorized as ocular, cervical, and vestibular/balance. Differences in presentation were compared between PPCS and controls as well as between individuals with PPCS in three age groups: adolescents, young adults, and older adults. RESULTS: All three PPCS groups had more abnormal oculomotor findings than their age-matched counterparts. When comparing PPCS patients from different age groups, no differences were seen in prevalence of abnormal smooth pursuits or saccades; however, adolescents with PPCS had more abnormal cervical findings and a lower prevalence of abnormal NPC, vestibular and balance findings. CONCLUSION: Patients with PPCS presented with a different constellation of clinical findings based on their age. Adolescents were more likely to demonstrate evidence of cervical injury compared to younger and older adults, and adults were more likely to present with vestibular findings and impaired NPC. Adults with PPCS were more likely to present with abnormal oculomotor findings compared to adults with non-traumatic causes of dizziness.},

PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To determine whether psychological readiness to return to sport is associated with second ACL injury. It was hypothesized a priori that at both preoperative and 12-month postoperative time points, patients who sustained a second ACL injury would have lower psychological readiness than patients who did not have a second injury. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Patients who had a primary ACLR procedure between June 2014 and June 2016 completed the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) (short version) scale before their ACLR and repeated the scale at 12 months after surgery to assess psychological readiness to return to sport. Patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years (range, 2-4 years) after surgery to determine further injury. The primary outcome was the relationship between ACL-RSI scores and the incidence of second ACL injury. RESULTS: In 329 patients who returned to sport after ACLR, 52 (16\%) sustained a second ACL injury. No difference in psychological readiness was observed at the preoperative time point, but patients who sustained a second injury trended toward lower psychological readiness at 12 months compared with noninjured patients (60.9 vs 67.2 points; P = .11). Younger ({$\leq$}20 years) patients with injury had significantly lower psychological readiness to return to sport than young noninjured patients (60.8 vs 71.5 points; P = .02), but no difference was found in older patients (60.9 vs 64.6 points; P = .58). In younger patients, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a cutoff score of 76.7 points with 90\% sensitivity to identify younger patients who sustained a second ACL injury. CONCLUSION: Younger patients with lower psychological readiness are at higher risk for a second ACL injury after return to sport.},

VEGF binds to tyrosine kinase cell receptors (VEGFRs): VEGFR-1 [Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1)], VEGFR-2 [kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) in human; fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1) in mouse] and VEGFR-3 [Fms-like tyrosine kinase 4 (Flt-4)]. While VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are expressed predominantly on vascular endothelial cells, VEGFR-3 is expressed especially on lymphatic endothelial cells. VEGFR-2 has the strongest pro-angiogenic activity and a higher tyrosine kinase activity than VEGFR-1. Endothelial cells also express co-receptors, such as neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and neuropilin-2 (NP-2), which modulate tyrosine kinase receptor activity. Both VEGF and VEGFRs are expressed not only on endothelial cells, but also on non-endothelial cells. This article aims to highlight the most recent data referring to the VEGF family and its receptors, as well as its implications in the angiogenesis process. At present, blocking angiogenesis in cancer or in other pathological processes, using anti-VEGF and anti-VEGFRs therapies, is considered to be extremely important.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) is defined as having an age of onset younger than 65 years. While early-onset AD is often overshadowed by the more common late-onset AD, recognition of the differences between early- and late-onset AD is important for clinicians.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early-onset AD comprises about 5\% to 6\% of cases of AD and includes a substantial percentage of phenotypic variants that differ from the usual amnestic presentation of typical AD. Characteristics of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include a larger genetic predisposition (familial mutations and summed polygenic risk), more aggressive course, more frequent delay in diagnosis, higher prevalence of traumatic brain injury, less memory impairment and greater involvement of other cognitive domains on presentation, and greater psychosocial difficulties. Neuroimaging features of early-onset AD in comparison to late-onset AD include greater frequency of hippocampal sparing and posterior neocortical atrophy, increased tau burden, and greater connectomic changes affecting frontoparietal networks rather than the default mode network.                                         SUMMARY               Early-onset AD differs substantially from late-onset AD, with different phenotypic presentations, greater genetic predisposition, and differences in neuropathologic burden and topography. Early-onset AD more often presents with nonamnestic phenotypic variants that spare the hippocampi and with greater tau burden in posterior neocortices. The early-onset AD phenotypic variants involve different neural networks than typical AD. The management of early-onset AD is similar to that of late-onset AD but with special emphasis on targeting specific cognitive areas and more age-appropriate psychosocial support and education.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Advances in acute stroke treatment, including the use of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion and, more recently, of IV thrombolysis in an extended time window, have resulted in a paradigm shift in how imaging is used in patients with acute stroke. This paradigm shift, combined with the understanding that ``time is brain,'' means that imaging must be fast, reliable, and available around the clock for physicians to make appropriate clinical decisions. CT has therefore become the primary imaging modality of choice. Recognition of a large vessel occlusion using CT angiography has become essential in identifying patients for endovascular thrombectomy, and techniques such as imaging collaterals on CT angiography or measuring blood flow to predict tissue fate using CT perfusion have become useful tools in selecting patients for acute stroke therapy. Understanding the use of these imaging modalities and techniques in dealing with an emergency such as acute stroke has therefore become more important than ever for physicians treating patients with acute stroke.                                         SUMMARY               Imaging the brain and the blood vessels supplying it using modern tools and techniques is a key step in understanding the pathophysiology of acute stroke and making appropriate and timely clinical decisions.},

This article provides an evidence-based approach to confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke, characterizing comorbidities that provide insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of stroke, and identifying targets for treatment to optimize the prevention of recurrent stroke.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Identifying the presence of patent foramen ovale, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and unstable plaque is now routinely included in an increasingly nuanced workup in patients with stroke, even as ongoing trials seek to clarify the best approaches for treating these and other comorbidities. Multicenter trials have demonstrated the therapeutic utility of patent foramen ovale closure in select patients younger than age 60 years. Insertable cardiac monitors detect atrial fibrillation lasting more than 30 seconds in about one in ten patients monitored for 12 months following a stroke. MRI of carotid plaque can detect unstable plaque at risk of being a source of cerebral embolism.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               To optimize the prevention of recurrent stroke, it is important to consider pathologies of intracranial and extracranial blood vessels and of cardiac structure and rhythm as well as other inherited or systemic causes of stroke. Some aspects of the stroke workup should be done routinely, while other components will depend on the clinical circumstances and preliminary testing results.},

High speed videography (200 fps), a force platform (500 Hz), and a Cybex II+ isokinetic dynamometer were used to assess rearfoot motion, ground reaction forces, and knee muscular strength and endurance, respectively. A linear discriminant function analysis of the training data revealed weekly mileage, training pace, number of months using current training protocol, \% time spent swimming, and \% time spent running on a track to be significant (P {$<$} 0.10). Height was a significant anthropometric discriminator, while seven isokinetic strength and endurance measures were found to discriminate significantly between the groups. Calcaneal to vertical touchdown angle, and maximum supination velocity were significant rearfoot movement discriminators. Maximum braking force was the only significant kinetic discriminator. A combined discriminant analysis using those variables found to be significant in the previous analyses revealed weekly mileage, and maximum normalized braking force to be the best discriminators (model P {$<$} 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

DESIGN: We reviewed high level athletes with an anterior cruciate ligament rupture on either MRI or arthroscopic evaluation more than 10 years previously, who were treated conservatively. They were pair-matched with patients who had had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with bone-patella-tendon-bone, with respect to age, gender and Tegner activity score before injury. PARTICIPANTS: In total 50 patients were pair-matched. RESULTS: We found no statistical difference between the patients treated conservatively or operatively with respect to osteoarthritis or meniscal lesions of the knee, as well as activity level, objective and subjective functional outcome. The patients who were treated operatively had a significantly better stability of the knee at examination. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the instability repair using a bone-patella-tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is a good knee stabilising operation. Both treatment options however show similar patient outcome at 10 year follow up.},

  abstract = {Injury patterns in distance running may be related to kinematic adjustments induced by fatigue. The goal was to measure changes in lower extremity mechanics during an exhaustive run in individuals with and without a history of iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS). Sixteen recreational runners ran to voluntary exhaustion on a treadmill at a self-selected pace. Eight runners had a history of ITBS. Twenty-three reflective marker positions were recorded by an eight-camera 120 Hz motion capture system. Joint angles during stance phase were exported to a musculoskeletal model (SIMM) with the iliotibial band (ITB) modeled as a passive structure to estimate strain in the ITB. For ITBS runners, at the end of the run: (1) knee flexion at heel-strike was higher than control (20.6 degrees versus 15.3 degrees, p=0.01); (2) the number of knees with predicted ITB impingment upon the lateral femoral epicondyle increased from 6 to 11. Strain in the ITB was higher in the ITBS runners throughout all of stance. Maximum foot adduction in the ITBS runners was higher versus control at the start of the run (p=0.003). Maximum foot inversion (p=0.03) and maximum knee internal rotation velocity (p=0.02) were higher versus control at the end of the run. In conclusion, ITB mechanics appear to be related to changes in knee flexion at heel-strike and internal rotation of the leg. These observations may suggest kinematic discriminators for clinical assessment.},

Eight competitive (COMP) and 8 recreational (REC) junior male surfers performed a 30-s sprint-paddling test for the determination of peak sprint power and accumulated O2 deficit. Surfers also performed an incremental-paddling test for the determination of the O2 uptake-power output relationship that was subsequently used to calculate the accumulated O2 deficit for the 30-s sprint-paddling test. During the 30-s sprint-paddling test, peak sprint power (404 {\textpm} 98 vs 292 {\textpm} 56 W, respectively, P = .01) and the accumulated O2 deficit (1.60 {\textpm} 0.31 vs 1.14 {\textpm} 0.38 L, respectively, P = .02) were greater in COMP than in REC surfers, whereas peak O2 uptake measured during the incremental-paddling test was not different (2.7 {\textpm} 0.1 vs 2.5 {\textpm} 0.2 L/min, respectively, P = .11). The higher peak sprint power and larger accumulated O2 deficit observed in COMP than in REC surfers during a 30-s sprint paddling test suggest that surfing promotes development of the anaerobic energy systems. Furthermore, peak sprint power determined during 30 s of sprint paddling may be considered a sensitive measure of surfing ability or experience in junior male surfers.},

  abstract = {Surfing has rapidly grown in popularity as the sport made its debut at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Surfing injuries are becoming more relevant with the globalisation and increasing risks of the sport, but despite this, little is known about surfing injuries or prevention strategies in either the competitive or recreational surfer. Prior research demonstrates that surfers are injured at a frequency of 0.74-1.79 injuries per 1000 hours of surfing. We reviewed the literature for the incidence, anatomical distribution, type and underlying mechanism of acute and overuse injuries, and discuss current preventative measures. This review finds that skin injuries represent the highest proportion of total injuries. Acute injuries most frequently affect the head, neck and face, followed by the lower limbs. Being struck by one's own board is the most common mechanism of injury. Non-contact acute ligament injuries have increased as surfing manoeuvres have become more acrobatic and overuse musculoskeletal injuries are highly correlated with paddling. However, there is a paucity of research for surfing injuries, and studies on overuse musculoskeletal injuries and prevention are disproportionally under-represented. Most of the prior studies are limited by small sample sizes, poor data collection methodology and geographical constraints. Further research is needed to establish preventative measures for both acute and overuse surfing injuries and to ensure the increasing popularity of surfing is met with an improved understanding of sport risks and safety. Specifically, we recommend research be prioritised regarding the efficacy of training programmes to prevent surfing-related overuse musculoskeletal injuries.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time-motion analysis has been used to provide detailed insight into surfers' performance. This study evaluated surfers' activity times at the Portuguese surfing championship in order to account for the time spent in each surfing activity. METHODS: Eighty-seven individually recorded videos of surfers were analyzed, showing their activity over the entire heat, and video analysis software was used to obtain each surfer's activity profile in the competition. RESULTS: The results breakdown by time percentage show that the surfers were paddling 50.9\% of the time, sprint paddling for wave 1.9\%, were stationary 34.1\% of the time, wave riding 3.7\%, and involved in miscellaneous activities (e.g., duck diving, board recovery, etc.) 9.4\% of the total time. Average times spent in each surfing activity were 18.6 seconds for paddling, 2.9 seconds for sprint paddling for a wave, 21.7 seconds for the stationary period, 11.5 seconds for wave riding, and 6.9 seconds for miscellaneous activities. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed that the most performed heat activity was paddling, allowing us to conclude that surfing is basically a long-arm paddling activity and that this activity constitutes a specific surfing competition demand, which in turn means that individual surfer's data can be used as a starting point for the development of tailored conditioning training programs.},

Recent studies have measured the physiological effects of physical therapy interventions, including manual therapy and traction, on the intervertebral discs (IVD), and these findings may have implications for the long-term management or even prevention of low back pain. PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the literature regarding possible physiological effects of physical therapy interventions on the intervertebral disc (IVD). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic Review. METHODS: A literature search of published articles through December 2014 resulted in the retrieval of 8 clinical studies assessing the influence of physical therapy interventions on the physiology of the IVD. RESULTS: Three studies, including two using animal models, investigated the effects of 30-minute intermittent traction on disc height. One in vivo animal study and two studies using human subjects assessed changes of disc height associated with static traction. Three studies investigated the effects of lumbar spine manipulation and mobilization on changes in water diffusion within the IVD. All studies confirmed, either directly or indirectly, that their respective intervention influenced disc physiology primarily through water flow. CONCLUSION: Physical therapy interventions may have an effect on the physiology of the IVD, primarily through water diffusion and molecular transport, which are important for the health of the IVD.},

However, increasing evidence has suggested progressive cognitive and psychiatric changes as well. Forty-six patients with PD, ranging in severity from Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) score of 1:4, were recruited from a clinic specializing in PD. Various cognitive and neuropsychological measures were used to discover if there were indeed differences due to the progression of PD. As H-Y stage significantly increased, so did age and levodopa equivalency dose of medications, both independent of one another. Years of education had a significant negative relationship with H-Y score. Measures of general cognition divulged a significant decrease as H-Y score increased. Finally, as H-Y score increased, magical ideation decreased, and religious group social support increased. Mechanistically, the significant cognitive decline occurring with H-Y staging may be linked to a reduced dopaminergic function. Significant cognitive and neuropsychological changes are associated with the progression of PD and its possible relationship to Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS).},

Hence, coaches and athletes have recognised the importance of physical preparation to enhance athletic performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a sport-specific, land-based-home exercise programme (LB-HEP) on sport-specific assessments related to surfing performance in recreational surfers. Twenty-two year-round recreational surfers divided into two groups: the exercise group (EG) performed the LB-HEP 3 times a week for 8\,weeks while the control group (CG) maintained their current exercise. Both groups were instructed to continue surfing during the study period. Each surfer completed sport-specific measurements related to surfing demands both pre-test and post-test (8\,weeks). There was a significant interactive effect of time and group (p\,=\,.009, {$\eta$}p2 =.298) on the surfer's performance questionnaire showing greater improvements in the EG. Additionally, the EG had an improvement on time to pop-up when compared to the CG ({$\eta$}p2 =.160). Based on the results, the LB-HEP is an effective training programme for all experience levels of recreational surfers to improve surfing performance measures short term.},

Return to sport (RTS) has historically been considered unlikely due to the severity of these injuries. Reporting in the literature regarding objective outcomes following MLKI, including RTS, is lacking, as are clear protocols for both rehabilitation progressions and RTS testing. RTS following MLKI is a complex process that requires an extended recovery duration compared to other surgery types. Progressions through postoperative rehabilitation and RTS should be thoughtful, gradual, and criterion based. After effective anatomic reconstruction to restore joint stability, objective measures of recovery including range of motion, strength, movement quality, power, and overall conditioning guide decision-making throughout the recovery process. It is important to frame the recovery process of the athlete in the context of the severity of their injury, as it is typically slower and less linear. Improved reporting on objective outcomes will enhance our understanding of recovery expectations within this population by highlighting persistent deficits that may interfere with a full recovery, including RTS.},

  abstract = {The brain-gut axis has been identified as an important contributor to the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease. In this pathology, inflammation is thought to be driven by the damage caused by aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein in the brain. Interestingly, the Braak's theory proposes that {$\alpha$}-synuclein misfolding may originate in the gut and spread in a "prion-like" manner through the vagus nerve into the central nervous system. In the enteric nervous system, enteric glial cells are the most abundant cellular component. Several studies have evaluated their role in Parkinson's disease. Using samples obtained from patients, cell cultures, or animal models, the studies with specific antibodies to label enteric glial cells (GFAP, Sox-10, and S100{$\beta$}) seem to indicate that activation and reactive gliosis are associated to the neurodegeneration produced by Parkinson's disease in the enteric nervous system. Of interest, Toll-like receptors, which are expressed on enteric glial cells, participate in the triggering of immune/inflammatory responses, in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and in the configuration of gut microbiota; thus, these receptors might contribute to Parkinson's disease. External factors like stress also seem to be relevant in its pathogenesis. Some authors have studied ways to reverse changes in EGCs with interventions such as administration of Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors, nutraceuticals, or physical exercise. Some researchers point out that beyond being activated during the disease, enteric glial cells may contribute to the development of synucleinopathies. Thus, it is still necessary to further study these cells and their role in Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Background:               Use of outcome measures (OMs) in adult neurologic physical therapy is essential for monitoring changes in a patient's status over time, quantifying observations and patient-reported function, enhancing communication, and increasing the efficiency of patient care. OMs also provide a mechanism to compare patient and organizational outcomes, examine intervention effectiveness, and generate new knowledge. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) examined the literature related to OMs of balance, gait, transfers, and patient-stated goals to identify a core set of OMs for use across adults with neurologic conditions and practice settings.                                         Methods:               To determine the scope of this CPG, surveys were conducted to assess the needs and priorities of consumers and physical therapists. OMs were identified through recommendations of the Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy's Evidence Database to Guide Effectiveness task forces. A systematic review of the literature on the OMs was conducted and additional OMs were identified; the literature search was repeated on these measures. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by 2 reviewers using a modified version of the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments. (COSMIN) checklist. Methodological quality and the strength of statistical results were determined. To be recommended for the core set, the OMs needed to demonstrate excellent psychometric properties in high-quality studies across neurologic conditions.                                         Results/Discussion:               Based on survey results, the CPG focuses on OMs that have acceptable clinical utility and can be used to assess change over time in a patient's balance, gait, transfers, and patient-stated goals. Strong, level I evidence supports the use of the Berg Balance Scale to assess changes in static and dynamic sitting and standing balance and the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale to assess changes in balance confidence. Strong to moderate evidence supports the use of the Functional Gait Assessment to assess changes in dynamic balance while walking, the 10 meter Walk Test to assess changes in gait speed, and the 6-Minute Walk Test to assess changes in walking distance. Best practice evidence supports the use of the 5 Times Sit-to-Stand to assess sit to standing transfers. Evidence was insufficient to support use of a specific OM to assess patient-stated goals across adult neurologic conditions. Physical therapists should discuss the OM results with patients and collaboratively decide how the results should inform the plan of care.

However, most investigations of spatio-temporal aspects of the nociceptive system have largely focused on intensity coding as consequence of spatial or temporal summation. Graphesthesia, the identification of numbers "written" on the skin, and assessment of the two-point discrimination thresholds were used to compare the exteroceptive capabilities of the tactile and nociceptive systems. Numbers were "written" on the forearm and the abdomen by tactile stimulation and by painful non-contact infrared laser heat stimulation. Subjects performed both graphesthesia tasks better than chance. The tactile graphesthesia tasks were performed with 89\% (82-97\%) correct responses on the forearm and 86\% (79-94\%) correct responses on the abdomen. Tactile graphesthesia tasks were significantly better than painful heat graphesthesia tasks that were performed with 31\% (23-40\%) and 44\% (37-51\%) correct responses on the forearm and abdomen, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the central nervous system is capable of assembling complex spatio-temporal patterns of nociceptive information from the body surface into unified mental objects with sufficient accuracy to enable behavioral discrimination.},

Latest Developments               Increasing recognition of neurologic complications and their adverse impact on long-term outcomes has led to increased neurology involvement in non-neurologic intensive care units. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of having a structured clinical approach to neurologic complications of critical illness as well as the critical care management of patients with chronic neurologic disabilities.                                         Essential Points               Critical illness is often accompanied by neurologic complications. Neurologists need to be aware of the unique needs of critically ill patients, especially the nuances of the neurologic examination, challenges in diagnostic testing, and neuropharmacologic aspects of commonly used medications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Communication during clinical encounters can be challenging with patients with communication disabilities. Physicians have the potential to positively affect the encounter by using communication strategies that engage the patient in patient-centered communication. OBJECTIVE: We engaged patients and their physicians in defining their preferences for patient-centered communication strategies, then evaluated the use of the identified strategies during observed clinical encounters. METHODS: We video-recorded 25 clinical encounters with persons with aphasia. All encounters were previously scheduled with community physicians and a companion was present. Following each encounter, physicians completed a brief questionnaire and the person with aphasia and his or her companion participated in a video elicitation interview. RESULTS: While many of the communication strategies identified and described by physicians, patients and companions were similar, patients and companions identified three additional key communication strategies. These strategies included (1) using visual aids, (2) writing down key words while speaking, and (3) using gestures. In the video recorded clinical encounters, no physicians wrote down key words while speaking and only one used a visual aid during the clinical encounter. The frequency with which physicians used gestures varied greatly, even within the same patient, suggesting the use of gestures was independent of patient or companion characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize patient-centered communication with patients with communication disabilities, physicians should use "disability-specific" communication strategies. Our study suggests that physicians should routinely ask patients and companions about communication preferences and then incorporate identified communication strategies into their communication style.},

Such pathology most often affects the anterior portion of the nerve and is visible on funduscopic examination. Ischemic optic neuropathy is associated with typical vascular risk factors and with one systemic disease in particular: giant cell arteritis (GCA). This article provides an overview of the three major classes of ischemic optic neuropathy, including information on risk factors, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Optical coherence tomography provides precise anatomic imaging in ischemic optic neuropathy, showing neural loss weeks before it is visible on examination. Refinements of optical coherence tomography reveal optic nerve microvasculature and may assist in understanding pathogenesis and verifying diagnosis. New diagnostic algorithms and cranial vascular imaging techniques help define the likelihood of GCA in patients with ischemic optic neuropathy. Finally, intraocular drug and biological agent delivery holds promise for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, whereas newer immunologic agents may provide effective steroid-sparing treatment for GCA.                                         SUMMARY               It is essential to recognize ischemic optic neuropathy upon presentation, especially to determine the likelihood of GCA and the need for immediate steroid therapy. A broad differential diagnosis should be considered so as not to miss alternative treatable pathology, especially in cases with retrobulbar optic nerve involvement.},

The basic premise of the PST is that changes in the relative level of physical stress cause a predictable adaptive response in all biological tissue. Specific thresholds define the upper and lower stress levels for each characteristic tissue response. Qualitatively, the 5 tissue responses to physical stress are decreased stress tolerance (eg, atrophy), maintenance, increased stress tolerance (eg, hypertrophy), injury, and death. Fundamental principles of tissue adaptation to physical stress are described that, in the authors' opinion, can be used to help guide physical therapy practice, education, and research. The description of fundamental principles is followed by a review of selected literature describing adaptation to physical stress for each of the 4 main organ systems described in the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice (ie, cardiovascular/pulmonary, integumentary, musculoskeletal, neuromuscular). Limitations and implications of the PST for practice, research, and education are presented.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                FSHD has a wide range of severity, yet a distinct phenotype characterized by weakness of the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles, followed by weakness of the trunk and leg muscles. It can be caused by two genetic mechanisms that share a common downstream pathway, namely, the epigenetic derepression and subsequent misexpression of the myotoxic                 DUX4                 transcription factor. Treatment is currently supportive and outlined in evidence-based guidelines. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of FSHD are paving the way for targeted therapy development. Approaches for targeted therapies to reduce                 DUX4                 expression that are currently being explored include small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, vector-based RNA interference, and gene therapy.

When clinicians apply the results of a systematic review or meta-analysis to patient care, they should start by evaluating the credibility of the methods of the systematic review, ie, the extent to which these methods have likely protected against misleading results. Credibility depends on whether the review addressed a sensible clinical question; included an exhaustive literature search; demonstrated reproducibility of the selection and assessment of studies; and presented results in a useful manner. For reviews that are sufficiently credible, clinicians must decide on the degree of confidence in the estimates that the evidence warrants (quality of evidence). Confidence depends on the risk of bias in the body of evidence; the precision and consistency of the results; whether the results directly apply to the patient of interest; and the likelihood of reporting bias. Shared decision making requires understanding of the estimates of magnitude of beneficial and harmful effects, and confidence in those estimates.},

However, only a relatively small number of studies have investigated the relationship between frontal lobe lesions and performance on the PIT. We compared 52 patients with unselected focal frontal lobe lesions with 52 closely matched healthy controls on a proverb interpretation task. Participants also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, including a fluid intelligence task (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices). Lesions were firstly analysed according to a standard left/right sub-division. Secondly, a finer-grained analysis compared the performance of patients with medial, left lateral and right lateral lesions with healthy controls. Thirdly, a contrast of specific frontal subgroups compared the performance of patients with medial lesions with patients with lateral frontal lesions. The results showed that patients with left frontal lesions were significantly impaired on the PIT, while in patients with right frontal lesions the impairments approached significance. Medial frontal patients were the only frontal subgroup impaired on the PIT, relative to healthy controls and lateral frontal patients. Interestingly, an error analysis indicated that a significantly higher number of concrete responses were found in the left lateral subgroup compared to healthy controls. We found no correlation between scores on the PIT and on the fluid intelligence task. Overall our results suggest that specific regions of the frontal lobes contribute to the performance on the PIT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are characterized by abnormal lipid metabolism manifested as altered fatty acid (FA) profiles of synovial fluid and tissues and in the way dietary FA supplements can influence the symptoms of especially RA. In addition to classic eicosanoids, the potential roles of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA)-derived specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) have become the focus of intensive research. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of the roles of FA and oxylipins in the degradation or protection of synovial joints. RECENT FINDINGS: There exists discordance between the large body of literature from cell culture and animal experiments on the adverse and beneficial effects of individual FA and the lack of effective treatments for joint destruction in OA and RA patients. Saturated 16:0 and 18:0 induce mostly deleterious effects, while long-chain n-3 PUFA, especially 20:5n-3, have positive influence on joint health. The situation can be more complex for n-6 PUFA, such as 18:2n-6, 20:4n-6, and its derivative prostaglandin E2, with a combination of potentially adverse and beneficial effects. SPM analogs have future potential as analgesics for arthritic pain. Alterations in FA profiles and their potential implications in SPM production may affect joint lubrication, synovial inflammation, pannus formation, as well as cartilage and bone degradation and contribute to the pathogeneses of inflammatory joint diseases. Further research directions include high-quality randomized controlled trials on dietary FA supplements and investigations on the significance of lipid composition of microvesicle membrane and cargo in joint diseases.},

Population encoding networks have the following intrinsic properties that provide an orderly explanation for normal and degraded language: (1) a capacity for settling into stable ``attractor'' states; (2) processing occurs in and knowledge (long-term memories) is stored in exactly the same network; (3) a capacity for incorporating statistical regularities of experience, frequency, and age of acquisition; (4) support of content-addressable memory; and (5) graceful degradation, such that lesions increase the probability of errors but do not fundamentally transform network operations. Knowledge in parallel distributed processing networks resides in the strength of connections between units (synapses in the brain). Aphasia, whether stemming from stroke or dementing disorders, can be understood in terms of the degradation of one or more domains of knowledge.                                         SUMMARY               Understanding the brain as a population encoding machine incorporating vast interconnectivity provides an orderly explanation for language function, both normal and abnormal.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The shoulder manual resistance test is one of the common clinical assessments for patients with muscle weakness. However, there have been no studies investigating the threshold for muscle weakness. The purpose of this study was to clarify the threshold for muscle weakness in the shoulder manual muscle resistance test. METHODS: Fifty-three patients (37.9~{\textpm}~20.6~years old) with either rotator cuff tear (21 patients), superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesion (7 patients), or Bankart lesion (25 patients) of one shoulder were administered three manual muscle resistance tests (abduction strength, external rotation, and belly press tests). Positive results in these tests were defined as a subjective weakness in the involved shoulder compared to the opposite shoulder. Based on this result, the patients were divided into positive and negative groups. Another observer measured isometric strength using a hand-held dynamometer and calculated the side-to-side ratio. Comparing instrument measurement with manual measurement, the cut-off point, at which we can recognise that there is a side-to-side difference, was calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The cases with less than 60\% of the muscle strength in the contralateral shoulder were judged as positive in all examinations, whereas among the cases with 60-90\% of muscle strength, there was a mixture of negative and positive determinations. The cut-off point was 78.9\% in the abduction strength test, 73.8\% in the external rotation test, and 84.0\% in the belly press test. CONCLUSION: The side-to-side difference could be manually detected, when muscle strength was less than 75-85\% of that on the contralateral side. This finding suggests that it is necessary to understand the limitation of these manual tests in the case of clinical examinations. Therefore, care must be taken for the shoulder manual muscle resistance test as muscle weakness cannot be fully detected by manual measurement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case-control study, Level IV.},

Despite their unique features, TACs often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for several years, leading to unnecessary pain and suffering. A significant proportion of TAC presentations may have secondary causes.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The underlying pathophysiology of TACs is likely rooted in hypothalamic dysfunction and derangements in the interplay of circuitry involving trigeminovascular, trigeminocervical, trigeminoautonomic, circadian, and nociceptive systems. Recent therapeutic advancements include a better understanding of how to use older therapies more effectively and the identification of new approaches.                                         SUMMARY               TAC syndromes are rare but important to recognize because of their debilitating nature and greater likelihood for having potentially serious underlying causes. Although treatment options have remained somewhat limited, scientific inquiry is continually advancing our understanding of these syndromes and how best to manage them.},

In many cases, test results are obtained as continuous values and require a process of conversion and interpretation and into a dichotomous form to determine the presence of a disease. The primary method used for this process is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is used to assess the overall diagnostic performance of a test and to compare the performance of two or more diagnostic tests. It is also used to select an optimal cut-off value for determining the presence or absence of a disease. Although clinicians who do not have expertise in statistics do not need to understand both the complex mathematical equation and the analytic process of ROC curves, understanding the core concepts of the ROC curve analysis is a prerequisite for the proper use and interpretation of the ROC curve. This review describes the basic concepts for the correct use and interpretation of the ROC curve, including parametric/nonparametric ROC curves, the meaning of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the partial AUC, methods for selecting the best cut-off value, and the statistical software to use for ROC curve analyses.},

Virtual Reality Training (VRT) may provide an interactive medium of rehabilitation, preventing a reduction in active participation of the patients while allowing for the training of sitting balance. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of VRT to conventional therapy in improving sitting balance in persons with SCI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a single blinded randomized control trial conducted on 21 subjects with SCI (level of injury: D10 or below). They were randomly allocated into two groups; both groups received their routine exercise program. In addition, the intervention group, that is, Group B (n = 11) received 30 min of VRT in the seated position using Xbox-Kinect, while the conventional therapy group, that is, Group A (n = 10) received 30 min of additional conventional therapy to equalize the duration of the intervention (3 days/week, 4 weeks). The modified functional reach test and T-shirt test were measured at the beginning and at the end of 4 weeks. RESULTS: MFRT changes for forward (Group A: 1.7 {\textpm} 1.09 cm; Group B: 4.83 {\textpm} 2.95 cm), right lateral (Group A: 2.43 {\textpm} 2.81 cm, Group B: 5.08 {\textpm} 1.85 cm), left lateral (Group A: 3.05 {\textpm} 4.65 cm, Group B: 6.19 {\textpm} 1.51 cm) were statistically significant for Group B (P {$<$} 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the two groups for T-shirt test (P {$>$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: VRT can be used as a part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program to improve sitting balance post-SCI.},

We assess a short alternative, the Sickness Impact Profile 68 (SIP68), for retest and proxy reliability, validity, and scaling properties, in a population of adults with disability (PWD). For convergent validity, the SIP68 was compared to the instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), activities of daily living (ADLs) and the short-form 36 (SF-36). We completed 398 interviews with PWD, 131 index-proxy sets, and 40 retests. Retest intraclass correlations were above 0.75 for all scales and dimensions except the physical dimension (0.61). Proxy reliability ranged from 0.26 (psychological autonomy and communication) to 0.85 (somatic autonomy). Correlation between the SIP68 and SIP was 0.94 overall; between the SIP68 and similar scales of the SF-36 correlations was moderate, and highest for physical health scales. We repeated the SIP68 development factor analysis and reproduced a structure of the full SIP that included 65 of SIP68 items. However, 36 additional items were retained that are not part of the SIP68. Overall, the SIP68 shows promise for use as a disability outcomes tool.},

  abstract = {Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a modality with growing interest in the last decade and has been recognized as a critical tool in rehabilitation medicine, athletic and clinical populations. Besides its potential for positive benefits, BFRT has the capability to induce adverse responses. BFRT may evoke increased blood pressure, abnormal cardiovascular responses and impact vascular health. Furthermore, some important concerns with the use of BFRT exists for individuals with established cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease patients). In addition, considering the potential risks of thrombosis promoted by BFRT in medically compromised populations, BFRT use warrants caution for patients that already display impaired blood coagulability, loss of antithrombotic mechanisms in the vessel wall, and stasis caused by immobility (e.g., COVID-19 patients, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, orthopedic post-surgery, anabolic steroid and ergogenic substance users, rheumatoid arthritis, and pregnant/postpartum women). To avoid untoward outcomes and ensure that BFRT is properly used, efficacy endpoints such as a questionnaire for risk stratification involving a review of the patient's medical history, signs, and symptoms indicative of underlying pathology is strongly advised. Here we present a model for BFRT pre-participation screening to theoretically reduce risk by excluding people with comorbidities or medically complex histories that could unnecessarily heighten intra- and/or post-exercise occurrence of adverse events. We propose this risk stratification tool as a framework to allow clinicians to use their knowledge, skills and expertise to assess and manage any risks related to the delivery of an appropriate BFRT exercise program. The questionnaires for risk stratification are adapted to guide clinicians for the referral, assessment, and suggestion of other modalities/approaches if/when necessary. Finally, the risk stratification might serve as a guideline for clinical protocols and future randomized controlled trial studies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               COVID-19 is the clinical syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It can affect the entire neuraxis, and presentations in the acute phase are variable, although anosmia is a common manifestation. Encephalopathy is common in patients who are hospitalized and is often associated with multiorgan involvement. Immune-mediated encephalitis is probably underrecognized; however, viral encephalitis is rare. Other manifestations include stroke, seizures, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathies, including Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, which sometimes has atypical manifestations. Treatment is symptomatic, and immunotherapies have been used successfully in some patients. Long-term complications include dysautonomia, exercise intolerance, malaise, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 may occur in the acute setting and may be independent of respiratory manifestations. Immune-mediated syndromes and cerebrovascular complications are common. Large populations of patients are expected to have long-term neurologic complications of COVID-19, many of which may emerge only after recovery from the acute illness.},

We performed both quantitative and qualitative syntheses in which the results were summarized on the basis of the reported measurement properties and study quality. Results: Ten eligible studies were included. The pooled PSFS reliability measure was excellent (intra-class correlation coefficient~=~0.89; 95\% CI: 0.75, 0.95). Validity measures displayed correlations that ranged from -0.47 to 0.69 when compared with other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) or other tests.

While the bleeding risks are low, the morbidity or mortality associated with a hemorrhagic event is not insignificant. The objective of this article is to review the natural history of these vascular entities, the risk factors for hemorrhage, preventive treatment options, and the risks of treatment.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Randomized trials to inform preventive treatment strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs are ongoing. Higher angiographic obliteration rates of unruptured intracranial aneurysms have been reported with the flow-diversion technique compared with alternative standard techniques. One randomized trial for unruptured brain AVMs showed a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent interventional treatment compared with observation.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               The decision to treat a patient with a brain aneurysm should consider patient factors, the patient's life expectancy, aneurysm anatomical factors, and treatment risks. Patients with unruptured brain AVMs should be observed in light of recent clinical trial data or enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial.},

  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging data embodies a massive multiple testing problem, where 100,000 correlated test statistics must be assessed. The familywise error rate, the chance of any false positives is the standard measure of Type I errors in multiple testing. In this paper we review and evaluate three approaches to thresholding images of test statistics: Bonferroni, random field and the permutation test. Owing to recent developments, improved Bonferroni procedures, such as Hochberg's methods, are now applicable to dependent data. Continuous random field methods use the smoothness of the image to adapt to the severity of the multiple testing problem. Also, increased computing power has made both permutation and bootstrap methods applicable to functional neuroimaging. We evaluate these approaches on t images using simulations and a collection of real datasets. We find that Bonferroni-related tests offer little improvement over Bonferroni, while the permutation method offers substantial improvement over the random field method for low smoothness and low degrees of freedom. We also show the limitations of trying to find an equivalent number of independent tests for an image of correlated test statistics.},

For studies that test multiple hypotheses or make multiple comparisons, the probability of at least 1 Type I error (family-wise error rate; FWER) increases as the number of hypotheses/comparisons increase. It is generally best practice to set the acceptable threshold for FWER to be less than or equal to {$\alpha$}.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous individual, temporal, injury- and surgery-specific factors impact the functional capacity during rehabilitation, return to sports (RTS), and re-injury prevention after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. PURPOSE: This multicentre cohort study evaluated the isolated and interactive contributions of time between injury and surgery, time since reconstruction, age, gender, pain, graft type, and concomitant injuries as to inertial sensor-assessed motor function after ACL reconstructions in multiple linear mixed model regressions. METHODS: Anonymized data were retrieved from a nationwide German registry. In this cohort study, patients with an acute unilateral ACL rupture, with or without concomitant ipsilateral knee injuries, and having passed an arthroscopically assisted anatomic reconstruction were included. Potential predictors were age [years], gender/sex, time since reconstruction [days], time between injury and reconstruction [days], concomitant intra-articular injuries (isolated ACL tear, meniscal tear, lateral ligament, unhappy triad), graft type (hamstrings, patellar, or quadriceps tendon autograft), and pain during each measurement (visual analogue scale 0-10~cm). Repeated inertial motion unit-assessments of a comprehensive battery of classic functional RTS test were performed in the course of the rehabilitation and return to sports: Joint position sense/kinesthesia (Angle reproduction error [degrees]), Dynamic Balance Composite score [cm] of the Y-Balance test), drop jumps (Knee displacement [cm]), Vertical hop (Hopping height [mm]), Speedy jumps (Duration [seconds]), Side hops (Number of hops [n]), single leg hop for distance (hopping distance [cm]). Repeated measures multiple linear mixed models investigated the impact and nesting interaction of the potential predictors on the functional outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 1441 persons (mean age 29.4, SD 11.8~years; 592 female, 849 male) were included. Most had an isolated ACL rupture: n\,=\,938 (65.1\%). Minor shares showed lateral ligament involvement: n\,=\,70 (4.9\%), meniscal tear: n\,=\,414 (28.7\%), or even unhappy triad: n\,=\,15 (1\%). Several predictors such as time between injury and reconstruction, time since reconstruction (estimates for ndays ranged from\,+\,.05 (i.e., an increase of the hopping distance of 0.05~cm per day since reconstruction occurs) for single leg hop for distance to\,+\,0.17 for vertical hopping height; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), age, gender, pain, graft type (patellar tendon graft: estimates between\,+\,0.21 for Y-balance and\,+\,0.48 for vertical hop performance; p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and concomitant injuries contribute to the individual courses of functional abilities of the reconstructed side after ACL reconstruction. The unimpaired side was mostly influenced by sex, age, the time between injury and reconstruction (estimates between -\,0.0033 (side hops) and\,+\,0.10 (vertical hopping height), p\,{$<$}\,0.001)), and time since reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Time since reconstruction, time between injury and reconstruction, age, gender, pain, graft type, and concomitant injuries are not independent but nested interrelating predictors of functional outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. It might not be enough to assess them isolated; the knowledge on their interactive contribution to motor function is helpful for the management of the reconstruction (earlier reconstructions should be preferred) deficit-oriented function-based rehabilitation (time- and function based rehabilitation instead of solely a time- or function based approach) and individualized return to sports strategies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: People exhibiting post-stroke lateropulsion actively push their body across the midline to the more affected side and/or resist weight shift toward the less affected side. Despite its prevalence and associated negative rehabilitation outcomes, no clinical practice guidelines exist for the rehabilitation of post-stroke lateropulsion. We aimed to develop consensus-based clinical practice recommendations for managing post-stroke lateropulsion using an international expert panel. DESIGN: This Delphi panel process conformed with Guidance on Conducting and Reporting Delphi Studies recommendations. PARTICIPANTS: Panel members had demonstrated clinical and/or scientific background in the rehabilitation of people with post-stroke lateropulsion. MAIN MEASURES: The process consisted of four electronic survey rounds. Round One consisted of 13 open questions. Subsequent rounds ascertained levels of agreement with statements derived from Round One. Consensus was defined a priori as {$\geq$}75\% agreement (agree or strongly agree), or {$\geq$}70\% agreement after excluding 'unsure' responses. RESULTS: Twenty participants completed all four rounds. Consensus was achieved regarding a total of 119 recommendations for rehabilitation approaches and considerations for rehabilitation delivery, positioning, managing fear of falling and fatigue, optimal therapy dose, and discharge planning. Statements for which 'some agreement' (50\%-74\% agreement) was achieved and those for which recommendations remain to be clarified were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations build on existing evidence to guide the selection of interventions for post-stroke lateropulsion. Future research is required to elaborate specific rehabilitation strategies, consider the impact of additional cognitive and perceptual impairments, describe positioning options, and detail optimal therapy dose for people with lateropulsion.},

Hand-held dynamometry is a practical alternative to electromechanical dynamometry but demonstrates insufficient reliability and criterion validity in healthy and ACL-reconstructed participants respectively. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reliability and concurrent validity of inline dynamometry for measuring quadriceps strength. The hypotheses are that intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values will be {$>$}0.90 for reliability and concurrent validity. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study using a within-participant, repeated measures design. Isometric quadriceps testing was performed at 60{$^\circ$} knee flexion in 50 healthy and 52 ACL-reconstructed participants. Interrater reliability, intrarater reliability, and concurrent validity of inline dynamometry was investigated through calculation of ICCs, Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression, standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC). RESULTS: The lower bounds of the 95\% confidence intervals were {$>$}0.90 for all reliability and validity ICCs in healthy and ACL-reconstructed participants, except for intrarater reliability in healthy participants using absolute scores (ICC~=~0.936 [95\% CI 0.890-0.963]). In ACL-reconstructed participants, Bland-Altman bias was 0.01 Nm/kg for absolute and average scores, limits of agreement were -11.74\% to 12.59\% for absolute scores, the SEM was 0.13Nm/kg (95\% CI 0.10-0.17) and the MDC was 0.36Nm/kg (95\% CI 0.28 - 0.47). CONCLUSION: Inline dynamometry is a reliable and economical alternative to electromechanical dynamometry for the assessment of quadriceps strength following ACL-reconstruction.

The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) allows the patient to identify specific self-reported items. This study evaluated the validity of the PSFS to assess outcome in patients with hand fractures or dislocations. METHODS: Adults with hand fractures or dislocations, who completed hand therapy between January 2012 and January 2013, were eligible for inclusion. At the initial and final assessment, each patient was asked to complete the PSFS. Each patient identified three items that were difficult or they were unable to perform, and the degree of difficulty was ranked from 0 to 10 (able to perform at pre-injury level). We excluded patients with an incomplete PSFS. Statistical analyses evaluated the relationships between the PSFS and the independent variables. RESULTS: There were 63 patients (37 men, 26 women); 21 of the 63 patients underwent surgery for fracture fixation. The mean duration of hand therapy treatment was 2.2\,{\textpm}\,1.4~months. The mean PSFS scores were as follows: initial 3.2\,{\textpm}\,2.2; final 8.1\,{\textpm}\,2.2. There was a significant improvement in PSFS scores from initial to final assessment (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and a moderate correlation (r\,=\,0.3, p\,=\,0.02). There was no statistical difference in PSFS scores between men and women or surgery and no surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In these patients with hand fractures or dislocations, the PSFS indicated significant improvement in function. Using items identified by the patient, the PSFS provides a valuable perspective of outcome and may be used in conjunction with generic disease-specific questionnaire for assessment of the upper extremity.},

The nonphysical factors germane to successful return to play (RTP) are being increasingly recognized. PURPOSE: To (1) evaluate the available evidence base for psychological factors relating to RTP after ACLR, (2) identify psychological factors affecting RTP after ACLR, and (3) understand currently available metrics used to assess psychological RTP readiness. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A review of the MEDLINE database was performed for studies reporting RTP after ACLR. Studies reporting on the psychological determinants of RTP were included. Demographic, methodological, and psychometric properties of the included studies were extracted. Weighted analysis was performed after patients were pooled across included studies. RESULTS: Of 999 studies identified in the initial search, 28 (2.8\%) studies, comprising 2918 patients, were included; 19 studies (n = 2175 patients) reported RTP rates. The mean time for RTP was 17.2 months. There was a 63.4\% rate of RTP, and 36.6\% of patients returning to sport were not able to perform at their prior level of play. Of the 795 patients who did not achieve RTP, 514 (64.7\%) cited a psychological reason for not returning. Fear of reinjury was the most common reason (n = 394; 76.7\%); other psychological factors included lack of confidence in the treated knee (n = 76; 14.8\%), depression (n = 29; 5.6\%), and lack of interest/motivation (n = 13; 2.5\%). The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury scale, and the Knee Self-Efficacy Scale were reported measures for assessing the influence of psychology on RTP. CONCLUSION: Psychological factors play an important role in RTP after ACLR. Among studies evaluating the impact of psychology on RTP, there was a delay in returning as well as lower RTP rates compared with the previously reported normative literature. Fear of reinjury was the most commonly reported impediment to RTP. The psychosocial measures identified in this review may have a role in RTP protocols for assessing mental resiliency; however, their roles need to be further investigated and validated in patients who have undergone ACLR.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To present the results of a return to sports bridge program designed to reduce knee injuries following ACL reconstruction and physical therapy. METHODS: One hundred and fifty (male\,=\,83, female\,=\,67) patients participated in a whole body neuromuscular control, progressive resistance strength and agility training program. Post-program testing included functional movement form, dynamic knee stability, lower extremity power, agility, and sports skill assessments. Participants completed the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale (KOS-SAS) before and after program initiation. Pre-participation scores were re-estimated following program completion. RESULTS: Global rating KOS-SAS score at program entry was 75\,{\textpm}\,13. Post-program global rating and calculated KOS-SAS were 91.0\,{\textpm}\,9.8 and 90.9\,{\textpm}\,9.7, respectively (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Pre-participation KOS-SAS score re-estimates at program completion were 54.5\,{\textpm}\,23.3 and 57.3\,{\textpm}\,18.5, respectively. The approximately 20\% lower pre-program KOS-SAS score re-estimates (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) observed at program completion suggests that subjects had inaccurately high sports readiness perceptions at program entry. Perceived overall sports activity knee function ratings improved from 2.9\,{\textpm}\,0.6 (abnormal) at program entry to 1.3\,{\textpm}\,0.5 (normal) at completion (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Most subjects returned back to sports at or above their pre-injury performance skill/performance level (84\%, 126/150). By 6.8\,{\textpm}\,3.2~years (range\,=\,2-13~years) post-surgery, ten subjects had sustained an ipsilateral knee re-injury or contralateral knee injury (6.7\%). The 2.7\% non-contact contralateral and 1.3\% non-contact ipsilateral knee injury rates observed were significantly lower than those cited~in previous reports. CONCLUSION: Supplementing primary ACL reconstruction and standard physical therapy with a return to sports bridge program prior to release to unrestricted sports performance was effective at improving patient outcomes and decreasing ipsilateral knee re-injury and contralateral knee injury rates.

Its incidence is expected to rise because of the age-related incidence of atrial fibrillation and an aging population. This article summarizes the different causes of cardioembolism and outlines current management guidelines.                                         Recent Findings:               Since cardioembolic stroke is not a single disease entity, its diagnosis requires initial clinical suspicion and a comprehensive evaluation, including ECG, echocardiography, brain imaging, and cardiac monitoring. Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended. This article reviews risk stratification models to assist in the decision-making process and highlights the increased use of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. New data support the importance of prolonged cardiac monitoring for diagnosing occult atrial fibrillation. Current data on other mechanisms of cardioembolic stroke, such as prosthetic heart valves and aortic arch atherosclerosis, are also presented, and the available evidence regarding patent foramen ovale closure in cryptogenic stroke is summarized.                                         Summary:               Cardioembolism is an important cause of ischemic stroke, with diverse underlying mechanisms requiring a tailored approach to diagnosis, management, and prevention.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Although children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often display motor deficits, the nature of these motor deficits remains unspecified. The purpose of this study was to establish a robust motor profile in children with ASD across a wider range of motor skills by using two professionally administered standardized motor assessments alongside a parent report measure to capture a comprehensive view of motor performance compared to a group of neurotypical peers. METHODS: Complex motor skills, balance and global motor performance were compared in twenty-four children, between the ages of 5-12\,years, split into two groups: ASD and typically developing. The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2) and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (MABC-2) were used to examine skill performance. Motor proficiency was also collected using the parent/caregiver form of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd edition (Vineland-3). RESULTS: Children with ASD presented with significant differences in complex motor skills, balance skills, and global motor performance when compared to their neurotypical peers across all three measures. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study indicated that the children with ASD had greater difficulty with global motor performance, including more difficulty performing complex motor tasks and balance tasks compared to their neurotypical peers. The parents of the children with ASD reported decreased proficiency of motor skills. Overall, the children with ASD demonstrated deficits performing tasks that targeted strength, speed, agility, coordination and both static and dynamic balance. While manifestations of motor skill deficits specific to the ASD population are variable, physical therapists should be included in the ongoing assessment and implementation of comprehensive therapeutic plans for children with ASD.},

More effective approaches to enhance motor recovery following stroke are needed. This article reviews the rehabilitative principles and strategies that can be used to maximize post-stroke recovery.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Evidence dictates that mobilization should not begin prior to 24 hours following stroke, but detailed guidelines beyond this are lacking. Specific classes of potentially detrimental medications should be avoided in the early days poststroke. Patients with stroke who are unable to return home should be referred for evaluation to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Research suggests that a substantial increase in both the dose and intensity of upper and lower extremity exercise is beneficial. A clinical trial supports vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunct to occupational therapy for motor recovery in the upper extremity. The data remain somewhat mixed as to whether robotics, transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation are better than dose-matched traditional exercise. No current drug therapy has been proven to augment exercise poststroke to enhance motor recovery.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists will collaborate with rehabilitation professionals for several months following a patient's stroke. Many questions still remain about the ideal exercise regimen to maximize motor recovery in patients poststroke. The next several years will likely bring a host of new research studies exploring the latest strategies to enhance motor recovery using poststroke exercise.},

Diagnostic criteria for MS have evolved over time, and the latest version facilitates earlier diagnosis of MS in those presenting with typical clinical syndromes. This article summarizes the current diagnostic criteria for MS, typical and atypical presentations of MS, and when diagnostic criteria should be applied with caution.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent version of the MS diagnostic criteria has the benefits of simplicity and greater sensitivity in comparison to previous iterations. However, misdiagnosis remains a significant issue in MS clinical care, even at MS specialty centers. It is, therefore, evident that careful clinical application of the current version of the diagnostic criteria is necessary and that tools improving the diagnostic accuracy of MS would be of substantial clinical utility. Emerging diagnostic biomarkers that may be useful in this regard, including the central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and fluid biomarkers, are discussed.                                         SUMMARY               Current MS diagnostic criteria facilitate the early diagnosis of MS in people presenting with typical clinical syndromes but should be used cautiously in those presenting with atypical syndromes and in special populations. Clinical judgment and existing paraclinical tools, including sequential MRIs of the neuraxis and laboratory tests, are useful in minimizing misdiagnosis and facilitating the accurate diagnosis of MS. Diagnostic biomarkers that may facilitate or refute a diagnosis of MS in these settings, and emerging imaging and fluid biomarkers may eventually become available for use in clinical settings.},

The main aim of the present study was to characterize the morphology (origin and insertion) and frequency of occurrence of the FTM and to use these findings as the basis for a new classification of the fibularis tertius tendon. Classical anatomical dissection was performed on 106 lower limbs fixed in 10\% formalin. The presence of the FTM and the morphology of both its origin and its insertion were described. The FTM was present in 91 limbs (85.8\%). Three types of origin were observed: Type 1, the most common type, with its origin on the distal half fibula (67\%); Type 2, with the origin on the distal third fibula (22\%); and Type 3, with an origin from the tendon of the extensor digitorum longus (11\%). In addition, six types of insertion were distinguished. The most common was Type I (45\%), a single distal attachment where the tendon inserts into the shaft of the fifth metatarsal bone. The rarest was Type VI, characterized by fusion with an additional band of the fibularis brevis tendon, which gives rise to the fourth interosseus dorsalis muscle. Two morphological variants of insertion could be distinguished, fan-shaped and band-shaped. Both the origin and insertion of the FTM are very morphologically variable, with three types of origin (Types 1-3) and six types of insertion point (Types I-VI) observed. Knowledge of such variations is essential for both clinicians and anatomists. Clin. Anat. 32:1082-1093, 2019. {\copyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

An understanding of the features specific to each type of toxic-metabolic and hereditary optic neuropathy, and of the underlying mechanism of insult to the optic nerve, could lead to earlier recognition, diagnosis, and treatment (when available).

Despite multiple studies assessing this treatment regime little is known about the mechanism of effect. This lack of understanding may be hindering therapeutic care and preventing optimal rehabilitation. Of the mechanisms proposed, most relate to tendon adaptation and fail to consider other possibilities. The current consensus is that tendon adaptation does not occur within timeframes associated with clinical improvements, therefore the clinical benefits must occur through another unidentified pathway. This clinical commentary critically reviews each of the proposed theories and highlights that muscle alterations are observed prior to onset of Achilles Tendinopathy and during the disease. Evidence shows that the observed muscle alterations change with treatment and that these adaptations have the ability to reduce tendon load and thereby improve tendon health. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to review previous theories regarding the mechanisms by which eccentric exercise might affect Achilles tendinopathy and offers a novel mechanism by which the plantarflexor muscles may shield the Achilles tendon.

  abstract = {We propose a biomechanical model to explain the pathogenesis of iliotibial band friction syndrome in distance runners. The model is based on a kinematic study of nine runners with iliotibial band friction syndrome, a cadaveric study of 11 normal knees, and a literature review. Friction (or impingement) occurs near footstrike, predominantly in the foot contact phase, between the posterior edge of the iliotibial band and the underlying lateral femoral epicondyle. The study subjects had an average knee flexion angle of 21.4 degrees +/- 4.3 degrees at footstrike, with friction occurring at, or slightly below, the 30 degrees of flexion traditionally described in the literature. In the cadavers we examined, there was substantial variation in the width of the iliotibial bands. This variation may affect individual predisposition to iliotibial band friction syndrome. Downhill running predisposes the runner to iliotibial band friction syndrome because the knee flexion angle at footstrike is reduced. Sprinting and faster running on level ground are less likely to cause or aggravate iliotibial band friction syndrome because, at footstrike, the knee is flexed beyond the angles at which friction occurs.},

Such effects relate to inflammation, immune responses, wound healing, and prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this report is two-fold: to 1) inform researchers about what appears to be a new perspective to the study of inflammation, and 2) alert researchers that the length of time and degree (resistance to ground) of grounding of experimental animals is an important but usually overlooked factor that can influence outcomes of studies of inflammation, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. Specifically, grounding an organism produces measurable differences in the concentrations of white blood cells, cytokines, and other molecules involved in the inflammatory response. We present several hypotheses to explain observed effects, based on current research results and our understanding of the electronic aspects of cell and tissue physiology, cell biology, biophysics, and biochemistry. An experimental injury to muscles, known as delayed onset muscle soreness, has been used to monitor the immune response under grounded versus ungrounded conditions. Grounding reduces pain and alters the numbers of circulating neutrophils and lymphocytes, and also affects various circulating chemical factors related to inflammation.},

During the period when this research was getting started, approximately 2000 to the present, scientists from around the world were establishing connections between inflammation and virtually all chronic diseases (Table 1) using the c-reactive protein assay developed by Ridker and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School. This article reviews Earthing, a safe therapy that optimizes (balances) each person's unique physiological functions; and that provides relief from the major diseases of the aging population; and that may slow the aging process itself. This statement is made because of the recognition that cumulative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS), sometimes referred to as free radicals, is one of the most widely studied theories of the cause of aging. Because the continuous semiconducting fabric of the body reaches into every part of the body, including the interiors of all cells and their nuclei, mobile electrons in the grounded or earthed person are thought to be capable of rapidly neutralizing ROS produced by oxidative metabolism taking place in every cell and tissue.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Establishing whether the cause of orthostatic hypotension is a pathologic lesion in sympathetic neurons (ie, neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) or secondary to other medical causes (ie, non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension) can be achieved by measuring blood pressure and heart rate at the bedside. Whereas fludrocortisone has been extensively used as first-line treatment in the past, it is associated with adverse events including renal and cardiac failure and increased risk of all-cause hospitalization. Distinguishing whether neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is caused by central or peripheral dysfunction has therapeutic implications. Patients with peripheral sympathetic denervation respond better to norepinephrine agonists/precursors such as droxidopa, whereas patients with central autonomic dysfunction respond better to norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.                                         SUMMARY               Management of orthostatic hypotension is aimed at improving quality of life and reducing symptoms rather than at normalizing blood pressure. Nonpharmacologic measures are the key to success. Pharmacologic options include volume expansion with fludrocortisone and sympathetic enhancement with midodrine, droxidopa, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Neurogenic supine hypertension complicates management of orthostatic hypotension and is primarily ameliorated by avoiding the supine position and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated.},

This article presents an up-to-date summary of the clinical presentation, investigations, and treatment options for urogenital dysfunction in patients with neurologic disease.                                         Recent Findings:               The pattern of lower urinary tract dysfunction is influenced by the site of the neurologic lesion. The risk for developing upper urinary tract damage is considerably less in patients with slowly progressive nontraumatic neurologic disorders, as compared to those with spinal cord injury or spina bifida.

Early in their clinical course, PSP and CBS may be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson disease and several other illnesses, but it is crucial to do so because of implications for management and prognosis.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Early accurate diagnosis of PSP and CBS remains a challenge because of heterogeneity in presenting symptoms and high frequency of coexisting pathologies (especially Alzheimer disease and vascular disease). It is increasingly recognized that patients with PSP, CBS, and other parkinsonian disorders require multidisciplinary care for optimal outcomes. With the recent proliferation of biomarker studies and therapeutic trials for tauopathies, there is growing hope that better treatments for PSP and CBS are on the horizon.                                         SUMMARY               Although PSP and CBS currently lack disease-modifying therapies, it is important to diagnose them as early as possible so that the patient can benefit from the many available symptomatic therapies, support groups, and a growing number of clinical trials.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of meralgia paresthetica (MP) and its relationship to diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity. METHODS: A population-based study was performed within Olmstead County Minnesota, from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999. MP incidence and its association with age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and DM were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 262 patients with MP, 262 normal controls, and 262 BMI-matched normal controls with mean age of 50 years were identified (51\% men). The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of MP was 32.6 per 100,000 patient years, whereas the incidence of MP in people with DM was 247 per 100,000 patient years, 7 times the occurrence of MP in the general population. Of the patients with MP, 28\% had DM vs 17\% of BMI-matched controls and the majority of people with MP developed DM after the diagnosis of MP. Patients with MP are 2 times more likely to develop DM (odds ratio 2, 95\% confidence interval 1.3-3.0, p = 0.0027). The mean BMI of patients with MP (30.1 kg/m(2), obese class I) was significantly higher than that of age- and gender-matched controls (27.3 kg/m(2), overweight). MP incidence increased 12.9 per 100,000 patient years in the hemidecade study period with an associated increase in both BMI (2.2 kg/m(2)) and average age (3 years). CONCLUSIONS: MP is a frequent painful neuropathy associated with obesity, advancing age, and DM. The incidence rate of MP is predicted to increase as these demographics increase in world populations. Because MP associates with DM beyond weight- and age-matched controls, more aggressive counseling of these patients in prevention of DM may be warranted.},

  abstract = {Grounding is a therapeutic technique that involves doing activities that ``ground'' or electrically reconnect us to the earth. The physiological effects of grounding have been reported from a variety of perspectives such as sleep or pain. However, its anti-stress efficacy is relatively unknown. The present study investigated the stress-related behavioral effects of earthing mat and its neurohormonal mechanisms in the Sprague-Dawley male rat. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: the na{\"i}ve normal (Normal), the 21 days immobilization stressed (Control), the 21 days stressed + earthing mat for 7 days (A7) or 21 days (A21) group. The depressive-and anxiety like behaviors were measured by forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze (EPM). Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and c-Fos immunoreactivity were analyzed in the brain. In the EPM, time spent in the open arm of the earthing mat groups was significantly increased compared to the Control group (p {$<$} 0.001), even though there were without effects among groups in the FST and TST. The expression of CRF immunoreactive neurons in the earthing mat group was markedly decreased compared to the Control group. Overall, the earthing mat reduced stress-induced behavioral changes and expression of c-Fos and CRF immunoreactivity in the brain. These results suggest that the earthing mat may have the potential to improve stress-related responses via the regulation of the corticotrophinergic system.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and although restoring striatal dopamine levels may improve symptoms, no treatment can cure or reverse the disease itself. Stem cell therapy has a regenerative effect and is being actively studied as a candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Mesenchymal stem cells are considered a promising option due to fewer ethical concerns, a lower risk of immune rejection, and a lower risk of teratogenicity. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives on motor function, memory, and preservation of dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease animal model. We searched bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles and included only peer-reviewed               in vivo               interventional animal studies published in any language through June 28, 2023. The study utilized the random-effect model to estimate the 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of the standard mean differences (SMD) between the treatment and control groups. We use the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation's risk of bias tool and the collaborative approach to meta-analysis and review of animal studies checklist for study quality assessment. A total of 33 studies with data from 840 Parkinson's disease model animals were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved motor function as assessed by the amphetamine-induced rotational test. Among the stem cell types, the bone marrow MSCs with neurotrophic factor group showed largest effect size (SMD [95\% CI] = --6.21 [--9.50 to --2.93],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 0.0 \%). The stem cell treatment group had significantly more tyrosine hydroxylase positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum ([95\% CI] = 1.04 [0.59 to 1.49],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 65.1 \%) and substantia nigra (SMD [95\% CI] = 1.38 [0.89 to 1.87],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 75.3 \%), indicating a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Subgroup analysis of the amphetamine-induced rotation test showed a significant reduction only in the intracranial-striatum route (SMD [95\% CI] = --2.59 [--3.25 to --1.94],               P               = 0.0001,               I               2               = 74.4 \%). The memory test showed significant improvement only in the intravenous route (SMD [95\% CI] = 4.80 [1.84 to 7.76],               P               = 0.027,               I               2               = 79.6 \%). Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to positively impact motor function and memory function and protect dopaminergic neurons in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required to determine the optimal stem cell types, modifications, transplanted cell numbers, and delivery methods for these protocols.},

The aim of this study was to assess which tools best predict the risk of falls in the elderly. Electronic searches were performed using Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, etc., using the following keywords: "fall risk assessment", "elderly fall screening", and "elderly mobility scale". The QUADAS-2 was applied to assess the internal validity of the diagnostic studies. Selected studies were meta-analyzed with MetaDisc 1.4. A total of 33 studies were eligible out of the 2,321 studies retrieved from selected databases. Twenty-six assessment tools for fall risk were used in the selected articles, and they tended to vary based on the setting. The fall risk assessment tools currently used for the elderly did not show sufficiently high predictive validity for differentiating high and low fall risks. The Berg Balance scale and Mobility Interaction Fall chart showed stable and high specificity, while the Downton Fall Risk Index, Hendrich II Fall Risk Model, St. Thomas's Risk Assessment Tool in Falling elderly inpatients, Timed Up and Go test, and Tinetti Balance scale showed the opposite results. We concluded that rather than a single measure, two assessment tools used together would better evaluate the characteristics of falls by the elderly that can occur due to a multitude of factors and maximize the advantages of each for predicting the occurrence of falls.},

Furthermore, the study aimed to compare pop-up performance between stronger and weaker surfers. Eighteen female (n = 9) and male (n = 9) surfers (age = 28.1 {\textpm} 6.4 years, mass = 69.6 {\textpm} 10.4 kg, and height = 172.5 {\textpm} 6.7 cm) completed a battery of upper-body strength assessments, of which exhibited high between-day reliability: IPU, (coefficient of variation [CV\%] = 4.7, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96), DPU (CV\% = 5.0, ICC = 0.90), and FP POP (CV\% = 4.4, ICC = 0.90). Participants were subsequently split into stronger (n = 9) and weaker (n = 9) surfers based on normalized peak force (PF) attained in the IPU. Pop-up performance was measured both in the water and during the FP POP and was referred to as time to pop-up (TTP). Significant between-group differences were observed for normalized PF during IPU (d = 1.59, p {$<$} 0.01) and DPU (d = 0.94 p = 0.04). Although not significant, there was a large magnitude difference in FP POP (d = 0.80, p = 0.08) and FP TTP (d = 0.85, p = 0.07). Significant correlations were identified between normalized IPU PF and normalized DPU FP (r = 0.69, p = 0.03) and FP TTP (r = 0.73, p = 0.02) in the stronger group. The weaker group exhibited a significant inverse correlation between normalized IPU PF and in-water TTP (r = -0.77, p {$<$} 0.01). The results suggest improvements in pop-up performance may be elicited by improving dynamic strength for stronger surfers, whereas pop-up performance in weaker surfers may be elicited by improving maximum strength. The upper-body strength assessments provided a novel insight into strength qualities that are associated with in-water performance of surfers (TTP).},

RECENT FINDINGS               Pediatric brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of tumors that differ from adult brain cancers despite similar nomenclature. With the added complexity of the developing brain, treatment regimens are tailored to protect neurocognitive outcomes without sacrificing long-term survival. The 2016 World Health Organization's classification incorporated molecular characteristics to aid in defining the diagnosis and prognosis of these tumors. These changes have enabled providers to stratify patients, thus intensifying therapies in those with high-risk diseases and modifying treatments to reduce morbidity for children and to provide better outcomes. Recent published findings from clinical trials have been especially helpful for gliomas, embryonal tumors, and ependymomas. By using this new information, molecular factors that correlate with survival have been identified in patients. In addition, genetic findings in tumor tissue have also led to revelations in predisposing germline mutations.                                         SUMMARY               New findings from clinical trials and molecular stratification will shape the next generation of therapies in hopes of improving overall outcome, identifying pathways in tumorigenesis, and aiding in genetic counseling for children and their families.},

Large-scale genetic testing has become much less expensive, and free testing has become available for many of the rare conditions because of increased research and the availability of effective therapies for these rare disorders.                                         SUMMARY               The approach to muscle and neuromuscular junction disorders depends on the clinical pattern of muscle weakness. By classifying patients into one of 10 muscle patterns, diagnostic testing can be targeted and gene testing yield will be optimized. With the increased accessibility and reduced cost of genetic testing (eg, gene panels, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, and chromosomal microarray), this clinical approach to muscle weakness and targeted gene testing will ensure a cost-effective investigational plan. This clinical approach should also assist clinicians in making a timely and accurate diagnosis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Contrary to popular belief, many congenital CNS infections are preventable and treatable. Treatment options exist for congenital cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis, although the efficacy of these treatments and the populations that may benefit from treatment are variable. Zika virus has recently emerged as a pathogen affecting the fetal brain, and new data suggest that the pathogenesis of Zika virus involves direct infection of neuronal progenitor cells leading to destruction of CNS tissue. The incidence of congenital syphilis has been increasing in the United States over the past decade as a direct result of new syphilis cases among adults and poor access to adequate maternal health care.                                         SUMMARY               Congenital CNS infections often result in significant neurologic morbidity in pediatric patients. Therefore, early identification of maternal illness and implementation of preventive measures are important in improving developmental outcomes and quality of life.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are approximately 2.1 million recreational surfers in the United States. However, little has been reported on surfing-related injuries and, to date, no study has utilized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to characterize injury patterns. OBJECTIVE: To use MRI to perform a descriptive analysis of surfing injuries in patients who presented to an urban tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital. This was not a hypothesis-driven study. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. METHODS: A retrospective review of the picture archiving and communication system as well as the electronic medical record was performed to identify patients with surfing-related injuries who presented to a tertiary care musculoskeletal hospital for treatment. The search included participants over a 10-year period who presented between January 1, 2009, and August 1, 2018. Descriptive data analyses were performed to determine frequency of body part injured, diagnosis, and operative versus nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: The search yielded 109 patients with surfing-related injuries and MRIs. A total of 90 patients presented within 6 months of their surfing injury and were included in the final analysis. The median age was 36 years (range, 12-66 years). A majority of the patients included were male (74\%; n = 67). Acute surfing injuries were diagnosed via imaging in 72\% (n = 65) of patients. The joints injured most commonly were the shoulder (46\%; n = 30) and the knee (28\%; n = 18). Only 17\% (n = 11) of acute surfing injuries required surgery, while 83\% (n = 54) were treated nonoperatively. CONCLUSION: The most common surfing-related injuries occurred in the shoulder and knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study helps characterize the risk of injury for surfers and informs healthcare providers on common surfing injuries.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review measurement properties, including acceptability, feasibility, and interpretability, and current uses of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). DESIGN: Systematic review of a patient-reported outcome measure using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched 11 databases from January 2010 to July 2020 for articles on measurement properties or use of PSFS. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Published primary articles without language restrictions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers screened all records, extracted data, and performed risk of bias assessments using COSMIN guidelines. We qualitatively synthesized findings for each measurement property in musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal conditions, and 2 reviewers independently performed Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation assessments. This study was preregistered with the Open Science Framework (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/42UZT). RESULTS: Of the 985 articles screened, we included 57 articles on measurement properties and 255 articles on the use of PSFS. The PSFS had sufficient test-retest reliability in musculoskeletal (22 studies, 845 participants, low-to-moderate certainty) and nonmusculoskeletal conditions (6 studies, 197 participants, very low certainty), insufficient construct validity as a measure of physical function (21 studies, 2 945 participants, low-to-moderate certainty), and sufficient responsiveness (32 studies, 13 770 participants, moderate-to-high certainty). The standard error of measurement ranged from 0.35 to 1.5. The PSFS was used in 87 unique health conditions, some without prior evidence of validity. CONCLUSION: The PSFS is an easy-to-use, reliable, and responsive scale in numerous musculoskeletal conditions, but the construct validity of PSFS remains uncertain. Further study of the measurement properties of the PSFS in nonmusculoskeletal conditions is necessary before clinical use. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2022;52(5):262-275.

RECENT FINDINGS               Systemic autoimmune diseases can be associated with a wide spectrum of neurologic comorbidities involving the central and peripheral nervous systems. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be associated with a number of manifestations predominantly affecting the central nervous system (CNS), whereas peripheral neuropathy is less common. Sj{\"o}gren syndrome can be associated with peripheral neuropathy in 10\% of cases and CNS disease in 2\% to 5\% of cases. The risk of stroke is increased in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Systemic vasculitides present most commonly with mononeuritis multiplex but can also affect the CNS. Cognitive dysfunction is a common symptom among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, most commonly seen in patients with SLE or Sj{\"o}gren syndrome.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologic manifestations of systemic autoimmune disease are important to recognize, as they may often be the presenting manifestation leading to diagnosis of the systemic disease or may be associated with increased morbidity, other complications, or mortality. Timely diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment, often requiring multidisciplinary care, is essential to minimize morbidity and decrease the risk of permanent neurologic deficits.},

Understanding the presentation of headache in women in relation to hormonal changes both during the menstrual cycle and throughout the life span is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Although perimenstrual migraine attacks are generally without aura, the diagnosis of migraine with aura has been added to the headache classification for menstrual migraine to account for women with the diagnosis of migraine with aura who experience menstrual migraine attacks. Emerging knowledge regarding the differences between menstrual and nonmenstrual attacks, the variability of attack triggering within and between women, and the response of women with menstrually related migraine to new migraine drug classes is contributing to better understanding and more effective treatment of these particularly burdensome and refractory attacks. Given the burden of migraine, almost one-fourth of women with migraine avoid or delay pregnancy. Women who experience migraine during pregnancy are more likely to have a hypertensive disorder and stroke during pregnancy and/or delivery and the postpartum period. Treatment of headache in general and migraine in particular in pregnancy is challenging because of fetal and maternal risks; however, a 2021 systematic review suggests that triptans and low-dose aspirin may not be associated with fetal/child adverse effects and could be more strongly considered for headache treatment in pregnancy.                                         SUMMARY               Headache in general and migraine in particular are extraordinarily common in women of reproductive age and fluctuate with hormonal changes and phases of life. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and response to treatment of perimenstrual attacks is essential for more effective response to this most burdensome headache type.

RECENT FINDINGS                                The 2018 Neurosarcoidosis Consortium diagnostic criteria emphasize that biopsy is key for diagnosis and determines the level of diagnostic certainty. Thus,                 definite neurosarcoidosis                 requires nervous system biopsy and                 probable neurosarcoidosis                 requires biopsy from extraneural tissue. Without biopsy,                 possible neurosarcoidosis                 can be diagnosed if the clinical, imaging, and laboratory picture is compatible and other causes are ruled out. Recent large retrospective studies from the United States and France established that infliximab appears to be efficacious when other treatments are inadequate.                                                        SUMMARY                                Sarcoidosis is a multisystem noninfectious granulomatous disorder that is immune mediated, reflecting the response to an as-yet unidentified antigen or antigens. Neurosarcoidosis refers to neurologic involvement due to sarcoidosis that clinically manifests in 5\% of cases of sarcoidosis, with asymptomatic involvement in as many as another one in five patients with sarcoidosis. Sarcoid granulomas can occur in any anatomic substrate in the nervous system, causing protean manifestations that have earned neurosarcoidosis the sobriquet                 the great mimic                 . Nevertheless, central nervous system sarcoidosis occurs in well-defined presentations that can be classified as cranial neuropathies, meningeal disease, brain parenchymal (including pituitary-hypothalamic) disease, and spinal cord disease. In addition, the peripheral nervous system is affected in the form of peripheral neuropathy and myopathy. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment, especially in the acute stage, whereas steroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine are used for prolonged therapy to minimize steroid toxicity. Anti--tumor necrosis factor agents may help in refractory cases.},

SUMMARY               The clinical spectrum of pediatric movement disorders is broad and heterogeneous, ranging from acute or transient self-limited conditions to conditions that cause profound lifelong motor disability. Most movement disorders in childhood are chronic, and the large number of rare, genetic conditions associated with pediatric movement disorders can pose a significant diagnostic challenge. Recognition of distinctive diagnostic clues in the history and examination can facilitate the diagnosis of potentially treatable disorders.},

METHODS: Using a systematic review methodology, the electronic databases PubMed, Virtual Health Library, PEDro, Scielo, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for eligible articles from 2011 up to September 2021. Quality assessment of eligible studies was performed using the PEDro scale. RESULTS: There were 239 identified studies. Eight clinical trials were selected. The total sample consisted of 264 individuals, with 134 allocated to the experimental group (hippotherapy) and 130 individuals to the control group (conventional therapy). Most studies had moderate to high methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: Hippotherapy can be an effective intervention to improve several aspects related to postural control, such as static balance (especially in the sitting posture), dynamic balance, and alignment (body posture) in children aged 3 to 16 years, particularly with spastic hemiplegia or diplegia. WHAT THIS ADDS TO THE EVIDENCE: This review summarizes studies that explore potential effects of hippotherapy on postural control in children with cerebral palsy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) are often associated with aural manifestations. However, it is not clear whether aural fullness could be induced by TMD. The purpose was to investigate the TMD and effectiveness of TMD treatments in patients with mainly or exclusively aural fullness complaint. METHODS: One hundred and twelve patients, who had aural fullness as the main or sole complaint, presented to the Otolaryngology Department, PLA Army General Hospital, Beijing, China, between January 2010 and January 2015. Patients' medical history indicated that they had previously been diagnosed and treated for otitis media or sensorineural hearing loss but without positive results. Patients were subjected to pure tone audiometry and acoustic immittance screening using GSI-61 clinical audiometer and GSI TympStar middle ear analyzer respectively. Patients were examined by questionnaire, X-ray and/or computed tomography scan of temporomandibular joint. TMD was categorized according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Patients were then treated for TMD. RESULTS: All the patients showed normal eardrum and type A tympanogram. The patients of 60.7\% (68/112) were classified as group I TMD disorders (muscle disorders), 34.8\% (39/112) were group II (disc displacements), and 4.5\% (5/112) were group III (arthralgia, osteoarthritis, and osteoarthrosis). Aural fullness was completely resolved or significantly improved in 67 and 34 patients respectively following treatments aimed at improving TMD, with a combined effectiveness of 90.2\% (101/112). TMD treatments are especially effective (94.1\%) in group I TMD. CONCLUSION: TMD as a potential cause of aural fullness should be considered in otolaryngology practice.},

Five different sausage formulations were produced: i) Control negative (CN): no nitrate added; ii) Control positive (CP) 150 mg/kg potassium nitrate; Group with celery powder (GSe): 3 g/kg celery powder; iii) Group with celery powder and beet powder (GSeB): 3 g/kg of celery and beet powder, respectively; iv) Group with spinach powder and beet powder (GSpB): 3 g/kg of spinach and beet powder, respectively. There was no significant difference between the residual nitrite contents of the samples at the end of the storage period. From microbiological analysis no target pathogenic bacterium has been isolated and the lactic bacteria microflora showed a similar trend in all of the lots. Suggested storage periods for CP, GSe and GSeB were over 60 days by taking into consideration the microbiology and sensory evaluation. Sensory evaluation scores of samples with celery powder, in fact, were comparable to those of CP during storage. The GSpB samples showed similar and higher values regarding the structural attributes, the related attribute to colour showed decidedly lower values due to a greenish coloration of the slice to the presence of spinach.},

Sclerosis and fragmentation have been supposed to represent signs of inflammation due to tractions from the Achilles tendon. The clinical findings, diagnostic criteria, and studied population are often poorly defined. We sought to define diagnostic criteria by analyzing clinical and radiographic characteristics in a population with Sever's injury and to compare the findings with those of a control group of matched, symptom-free children. METHODS: We assessed 30 consecutive children with Sever's injury with high levels of pain but high physical activity levels in sports activities and 15 pain-free matched controls. RESULTS: One-leg heel standing showed 100\% sensitivity; the squeeze test, 97\%; and the palpation test, 80\%. All three tests showed 100\% specificity. All of the patients and controls showed increased density of the apophysis. Half of the pain-free controls showed fragmentation versus almost 90\% of children with heel pain. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Sever's injury is clinical, not radiologic. Radiologic findings of increased density and fragmentation are found also in pain-free controls with high levels of physical activity and may, therefore, represent normal growth and development. We suggest that the diagnosis of Sever's injury should be based on patient history and the results of two specific clinical tests.},

In the United States, 1.5 million TBIs occur annually, 75\% of TBIs are classified as mild, and costs~are generated of \$17 billion each year. Most patients that suffer from TBI will have spontaneous resolution of symptoms, but for some patients, symptoms may linger and negatively affect daily cognitive function. Post-concussive syndrome (PCS) demarcates the constellation of symptoms seen most often in~prolonged~mild TBI, however, it may also occur following moderate and severe TBI. Clinical criteria for PCS are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). PCS is a constellation of physical, cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symptoms occurring after TBI. These symptoms include a headache, fatigue, vision changes, disturbances in balance, confusion, dizziness, insomnia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and difficulty with concentration.~Approximately 90\% of concussion symptoms are transient, with symptoms resolving within 10 to 14 days but may linger for weeks. Persistent PCS occurs when symptoms persist past 3 months. Fifteen percent of mild TBI patients will suffer from PCS, and a small minority of those patients will experience persistent PCS requiring further evaluation and treatment. Research has shown that mild TBI resulting in persistent PCS has lasting effects on cognition, memory, learning, and executive function. Patients who suffer more than one~brain injury are at increased risk for PCS. Due to limited diagnostic tools, those permanent changes in executive function can go undocumented. Thus, the 15\% incidence of PCS is an underestimation of the true incidence.},

Twenty seven were managed by delayed cholecystectomy between 8 weeks and 6 months of the acute episode. Early surgery required a longer operating time (120 +/- 15 minutes vs 90 +/- 15 minutes), more skill and had a marginally higher operative blood loss (150 vs 100ml). Early surgery did not after the decision or outcome of bile duct exploration. There were no fatalities or major complications.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevation of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF frequently occurs during active and acute CNS inflammatory processes and presumably is associated with B cell-related immune activation. Elevation levels, however, vary a lot and "leaking" of CXCL13 from blood across dysfunctional brain barriers is a possible source. The aim was to clarify the relation between CXCL13 concentrations in CSF, CXCL13 concentrations in serum and blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) function for a correct interpretation of the intrathecal origin of CXCL13. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed CXCL13 of banked CSF/serum samples (n\,=\,69) selected from patient records and categorized the CSF CXCL13 elevations as CXCL13 negative ({$<$}\,30~pg/ml), low (30-100~pg/ml), medium (101-250~pg/ml), or high ({$>$}\,250~pg/ml). CXCL13 concentrations in CSF and serum and the corresponding CSF/serum CXCL13 quotients (Qcxcl13) were compared to CSF/serum albumin quotients (QAlb) as a measure for BCSFB function. The CXCL13 negative category included two subgroups with normal and dysfunctional BCSFB. RESULTS: Serum CXCL13 concentrations were similar across categories with median levels around 100~pg/ml but differed between individuals (29 to {$>$}\,505~pg/ml). Despite clear evidence in serum, CXCL13 was detectable only at trace amounts (medians 3.5 and 7.5~pg/ml) in CSF of the two CXCL13 negative subgroups irrespective of a normal or pathological QAlb. Moreover, we found no association between CSF and serum CXCL13 levels or between QAlb and CSF CXCL13 levels in any of the CSF CXCL13-delineated categories. CXCL13 apparently does not "leak" from blood into CSF. This implies an intrathecal origin also for low CSF CXCL13 levels and a caveat for analyzing the Qcxcl13, because higher serum than CSF concentrations arithmetically depress the Qcxcl13 resulting in misleadingly low CSF/serum quotients. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that CXCL13 does not cross from blood into CSF, not even during severe BCSFB dysfunction. CSF CXCL13 elevations therefore most likely always are CNS-derived, which highlights their relevance as indicator of inflammatory CNS processes. We recommend data should not be corrected for BCSFB permeability (QAlb) and not to calculate CSF/serum quotients for CXCL13 as these may introduce error.},

This article describes the most common respiratory viruses that have neurologic manifestations, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               In vitro and in vivo studies have better elucidated the neurotropism of various respiratory viruses. Understanding host cell receptors that mediate viral binding and entry not only demonstrates how viruses enter host cells but also provides possible mechanisms for therapeutic interventions. Elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 binding and fusion with host cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor may also provide greater insights into its systemic and neurologic sequelae. Respiratory virus neurotropism and collateral injury due to concurrent inflammatory cascades result in various neurologic pathologies, including Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and seizures.                                         SUMMARY               Numerous respiratory viruses can infect the cells of the peripheral and central nervous systems, elicit inflammatory cascades, and directly and indirectly cause various neurologic manifestations. Patients with neurologic manifestations from respiratory viruses are often critically ill and require mechanical ventilation. Neurologists and neurointensivists should be familiar with the common neurologic manifestations of respiratory viruses and the unique and still-evolving sequelae associated with COVID-19.},

Anecdotal evidence, clinical and laboratory, suggests that OA bone contains more fat. However, conversion of osteoblasts to adipocytes is reported in OP and this would suggest that the more porous OP cancellous bone would have a high fat content. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that OA bone contains more fat than OP bone. METHODS: Cores of cancellous bone were obtained from femoral heads of patients undergoing surgery for either OA or OP. Lipids were extracted using chloroform-methanol, weighed and expressed as a fraction of core mass and volume. A fatty acid analysis was performed using gas chromatography. RESULTS: OA bone contained twice as much fat per unit volume of tissue as OP. Levels of n-6 fatty acids were elevated in OA, especially arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) which was almost double that found in OP. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that lipids may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of OA and may provide part of the key to understanding why OA and OP lie at opposite ends of the spectrum of bone masses.},

Objectives To characterize the prevalence of scapular dyskinesis in participants with and without shoulder pain, and to determine the influence of blinding to the presence of shoulder pain on prevalence of scapular dyskinesis. Methods Participants (n = 135), 67 with shoulder pain and 68 healthy controls, were included in this study. The SDT was performed by 2 examiners, from a total of 21 physical therapists. The second examiner was blinded to the participant's presence of shoulder pain. The SDT involved participants performing 5 repetitions of shoulder flexion and abduction, while the clinician observed for scapular dyskinesis, as characterized by scapular winging or dysrhythmia. Dyskinesis was rated as normal, subtle, or obvious. Ratings were collapsed into 2 groups, dyskinesis (subtle and obvious) and no dyskinesis (normal), as recommended by expert consensus. Results There were no significant differences for scapular dyskinesis prevalence between the shoulder pain group and control group during the SDT in abduction (shoulder pain, 67.2\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 52.9\%; 95\% CI: 0.41, 0.64; P = .09) or flexion (shoulder pain, 67.2\%; 95\% CI: 0.55, 0.77 and control group, 61.8\%; 95\% CI: 0.50, 0.72; P = .51). There were significant differences (P {$\leq$}001) between the examiners' SDT ratings in the shoulder pain group. The unblinded examiner reported a higher prevalence when testing the involved shoulder for dyskinesis in flexion (blinded, 67.7\%; 95\% CI: 0.56, 0.78 and unblinded, 80\%; 95\% CI: 0.69, 0.88) and during abduction (blinded, 66.2\%; 95\% CI: 0.54, 0.76 and unblinded, 78.5\%; 95\% CI: 0.67, 0.87). Conclusion Scapular dyskinesis as assessed with the SDT is not more prevalent in those with shoulder pain. Rating was influenced by an examiner's knowledge of shoulder pain presence. Scapular dyskinesis may represent normal movement variability. Level of Evidence Diagnosis, level 4. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2017;47(8):530-537. Epub 6 Jul 2017. doi:10.2519/jospt.2017.7268.},

  abstract = {Background               . The effect of thermal stress on the physiological parameters of young overweight and sedentary men who sporadically use the sauna remains insufficiently investigated.               Aim               . The aim of the study was to determine the effect of sauna bathing on the physiological parameters of young overweight, physically inactive men and to test the correlations between physiological parameters versus anthropometric features and body composition parameters.               Materials and Methods               . Forty-five overweight and sedentary men aged 20.76{\textpm}2.4 y were exposed to four sauna sessions of 10 minutes each (temperature: 90-91{$^\circ$}C; relative humidity: 14-16 \%) with four 5-minute cool-down breaks. Body composition was determined before sauna, and body mass and blood pressure were measured before and after sauna. Physiological parameters were monitored during four 10-minute sauna sessions.               Results               . A significant (p{$<$}0.0001) increase in all analyzed physiological parameters was observed during four successive 10-minute sauna sessions. Heart rate, energy expenditure, blood pressure, and body mass loss were most strongly correlated with anthropometric parameters (body mass, body mass index, and body surface area) and body composition parameters (percent body fat, body fat mass, and visceral fat level). The 60-minute treatment resulted in a significant reduction in body mass (0.65 kg).               Conclusions               . Repeated use of Finnish sauna induces significant changes in the physiological parameters of young sedentary overweight men, and these changes are intensified during successive treatments. Deleterious cardiovascular adaptations were most prevalent in men characterized by the highest degree of obesity and the largest body size.},

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this paper are to describe emerging ideas relating to the development and testing of new measures in health fields, to present a revised measurement taxonomy that builds upon COSMIN, and to explore the extent to which the new measurement concepts have played a role in psychometric assessments in nursing. DESIGN: A descriptive analysis of a sample of psychometric papers published in three major nursing journals was undertaken. METHODS: A new measurement taxonomy is presented and explained. A sample of 105 studies, representing a consecutive sample of psychometric studies published in the International Journal of Nursing Studies, Nursing Research, and Research in Nursing \& Health between 2010 and 2014 was reviewed to ascertain the extent to which psychometric assessments in nursing map onto the new taxonomy. RESULTS: Most nursing studies reviewed adhered to traditional concepts of psychometric assessment, which focus on reliability and validity. The studies in the sample rarely involved assessments of longitudinal measurement aspects, namely the reliability and validity of change scores (responsiveness). CONCLUSIONS: Many constructs of interest to nurse researchers are amenable to change-and these constructs are frequently the target of nursing interventions designed to foster change. Future psychometric work by nurse researchers would benefit from assessments of the psychometric adequacy of change scores.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Significant advances are being made in the recognition and characterization of the syndromically diverse AD variants. These variants are identified by the predominant cognitive and clinical features: early-onset amnestic syndrome, aphasia, visuospatial impairments, dysexecutive and behavioral disturbance, or motor symptoms. Although understanding of regional susceptibility to disease remains in its infancy, visualizing amyloid and tau pathology in vivo and CSF examination of amyloid-{$\beta$} and tau proteins are particularly useful in atypical AD, which can be otherwise prone to misdiagnosis. Large-scale research efforts, such as LEADS (the Longitudinal Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease Study), are currently ongoing and will continue to shed light on our understanding of these diverse presentations.                                         SUMMARY               Understanding the clinical, neuroimaging, and biomarker profiles of the heterogeneous group of atypical AD syndromes improves diagnostic accuracy in patients who are at increased risk of misdiagnosis.

This review summarizes potential neurologic complications in patients who have undergone treatment for neurologic and systemic malignancies.                                         Latest Developments               Radiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy along with other targeted therapies continue to be the mainstay of cancer treatment. These advances in cancer care have led to improved outcomes and increased the need to understand the spectrum of neurologic complications that may arise from treatment. While radiation and older therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapies have side effect profiles that are widely known and well understood, this article serves as a review of the more commonly associated neurologic complications of both traditional and newer treatments being offered to this patient population.                                         Essential Points               Neurotoxicity is a common complication of cancer-directed treatment. In general, neurologic complications of radiation therapy are more common in central nervous system malignancies, and neurologic complications of chemotherapy are more common in non-neurologic malignancies.

For each disorder, a historical perspective is offered and relevant neuroscientific studies are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Careful analysis of the consequences of lesions that disrupt visual functions such as facial recognition and written language processing has improved understanding of the role of key regions in these networks. In addition, modern imaging techniques have built upon prior lesion studies to further elucidate the functions of these cortical areas. For example, functional MRI (fMRI) has identified and characterized the response properties of ventral regions that contribute to object recognition and dorsal regions that subserve motion perception and visuospatial attention. Newer network-based functional imaging studies have shed light on the mechanisms behind various causes of spontaneous visual hallucinations.

It provides a clinical approach to the most commonly affected patient groups based on clinicoanatomic presentation and disease-specific risks resulting from immune deficits and drugs received.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The clinical presentations, associated neuroimaging findings, and CSF abnormalities of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompromised may differ from those of patients with central nervous system infections who are immunocompetent and may be confused with noninfectious processes. Triggering of brain autoimmunity with emergence of neurotropic antibodies has emerged as a recognized parainfectious complication. New unbiased metagenomic assays to identify obscure pathogens help clinicians navigate the increasing range of conditions affecting the growing population of patients with altered immunity.                                         SUMMARY               Despite evidence-based prophylactic regimens and organism-specific antimicrobials, central nervous system infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in an increasing range of patients who are immunocompromised by their conditions and therapies. Multiple new drugs put patients at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which has numerous imaging and clinical manifestations; patients at risk include those with multiple sclerosis, for whom infection risk is becoming one of the most important factors in therapeutic decision making. Efficient, early diagnosis is essential to improve outcomes in these often-devastating diseases.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The incidence of ischemic stroke in young adults has been increasing since the 1980s, which has occurred in parallel with increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors and substance abuse among the younger population. Young adults have a considerably wider range of risk factors than older patients, including age-specific factors such as pregnancy/puerperium and oral contraceptive use. Behavioral risk factors such as low physical activity, excess alcohol consumption, and smoking are factors as well. More than 150 identified causes of early-onset ischemic stroke exist, including rare monogenic disorders. Several recent advances have been made in diagnosis and management of stroke in young adults, including molecular characterization of monogenic vasculitis due to deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 and transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale for secondary prevention. Compared with the background population of the same age and sex, long-term mortality in patients remains fourfold higher with cardiovascular causes underlying most of the deaths. The cumulative rate of recurrent stroke extends up to 15\% at 10 years. Patients with atherosclerosis, high-risk sources of cardioembolism, and small vessel disease underlying their stroke seem to have the worst prognosis regarding survival and recurrent vascular events. Young stroke survivors also often have other adverse outcomes in the long term, including epilepsy, pain, cognitive problems, and depression.                                         SUMMARY               Systematic identification of risk factors and causes and the motivation of patients for long-term prevention and lifestyle changes are of utmost importance to improve the prognosis of early-onset ischemic stroke.},

This article describes the epidemiology, genetic and environmental risk factors, clinical diagnosis, biomarkers, and treatment of late-onset AD, defined by age of onset of 65 years or older.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with AD dementia, with the number of affected individuals growing rapidly because of an aging population. Vascular risk factors, sleep disorders, and traumatic brain injury are associated with an increased risk of AD, while increased cognitive and physical activity throughout the lifespan reduce the risk of disease. The primary genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the apolipoprotein E (                 APOE                 ) {$\varepsilon$}4 allele. AD typically presents with early and prominent episodic memory loss, although this clinical syndrome is neither sensitive nor specific for underlying AD neuropathology. Emerging CSF and imaging biomarkers can now detect the key neuropathologic features of the disease (amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration) in living people, allowing for characterization of patients based on biological measures. A comprehensive treatment plan for AD includes use of symptomatic medications, optimal treatment of comorbid conditions and neuropsychiatric symptoms, counseling about safety and future planning, and referrals to community resources.                                                        SUMMARY               AD is very common in older neurologic patients. Neurologists should set the standard for the diagnosis and care of patients with AD and should be familiar with emerging biomarkers that have transformed AD research and are primed to enter the clinical arena.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               Autonomic hyperactivity is a relatively common consequence of severe acute brain injury and can also be seen with spinal cord and peripheral nerve disorders. This article reviews basic pathophysiologic concepts regarding autonomic hyperactivity, its various forms of clinical presentation, and practical management considerations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is most common after traumatic brain injury but can also occur after other forms of severe acute diffuse or multifocal brain injury. Formal criteria for the diagnosis and severity grading of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity have now been proposed. A growing body of literature is beginning to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this disorder, but treatment remains based on observational data. Our mechanistic understanding of other distinct forms of autonomic hyperactivity, such as autonomic dysreflexia after traumatic spinal cord injury and dysautonomia after Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, remains rudimentary, yet clinical experience shows that their appropriate management can minimize the risk of serious complications.                                         SUMMARY               Syndromes of autonomic hyperactivity can result from injury at all levels of the neuraxis. Much more research is needed to refine our understanding of these disorders and guide optimal management decisions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Immobilization of the spine and spine clearance should be individualized depending on the ability to perform a reliable neurologic examination, the presence of neck pain, and the imaging findings. Early surgery (within 24 hours) to achieve definitive cord decompression and spine stabilization may be beneficial. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and perfusion and avoiding secondary systemic complications remain the goals of the critical care of these patients. No neuroprotective treatment has been shown to improve outcomes. In fact, the use of high-dose methylprednisolone is now generally discouraged because of its major systemic adverse effects. Survivors of severe cervical traumatic spinal cord injury typically sustain substantial long-term functional impairment. Advances in our understanding of neuroregenerative strategies, especially stem cell transplantation, can offer the future hope of functional improvement to the many patients currently living with the consequences of traumatic spinal cord injury. Yet, at present, these therapies remain strictly investigational.                                         SUMMARY               The treatment of traumatic spinal cord injury remains supportive, and prognosis is still poor for patients who are severely affected. While much remains to be learned about how to optimize the acute management of these patients, future efforts would be most useful if focused on injury prevention and the development of effective neuroregenerative therapies.},

Recent Findings:               The results of several randomized controlled trials consistently and conclusively demonstrating that previously functional patients with disabling strokes from a proximal intracranial artery occlusion benefit from prompt recanalization with mechanical thrombectomy using a retrievable stent have changed the landscape of acute stroke therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of symptom onset should now be considered the preferred treatment for these patients along with IV thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within the first 4.5 hours for all patients who do not have contraindications for systemic thrombolysis. Patients who are ineligible for IV rtPA can also benefit from mechanical thrombectomy.

ABSTRACT               PURPOSE OF REVIEW               This article provides an update on the state of the art of the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with particular emphasis on the indications for reperfusion therapy.               RECENT FINDINGS               In addition to the previously established indications for intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset and endovascular therapy with mechanical thrombectomy for patients with large artery occlusion who can be treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, recent randomized controlled trials have now established new indications for emergency reperfusion in patients with wake-up stroke or delayed presentation (up to 24 hours from last known well in the case of mechanical thrombectomy). Identification of patients who may benefit from acute reperfusion therapy within this extended time window requires screening with perfusion brain imaging or, in the case of IV thrombolysis for wake-up strokes, emergency brain MRI. Collateral status and time to reperfusion remain the primary determinants of outcome.

RECENT FINDINGS               Therapy for LEMS has seen significant advances in recent years due to the approval of amifampridine-based compounds. LEMS is likely still underdiagnosed, particularly when no underlying malignancy is identified. Clinicians must have a strong suspicion for LEMS in any patient presenting with proximal weakness and autonomic dysfunction. Botulism is another rare disorder of presynaptic neuromuscular transmission that is most commonly associated with improper storage or preservation of food products. Over the past 2 decades, wound botulism has been increasingly reported among users of black tar heroin. A high degree of clinical suspicion and electrodiagnostic studies can be beneficial in distinguishing botulism from other acute neurologic disorders, and early involvement of state and federal health authorities may assist in confirming the diagnosis and obtaining treatment. When botulism is suspected, electrodiagnostic studies can provide clinical evidence of disordered neuromuscular transmission in advance of serologic confirmation, and providers should not wait for confirmation of the diagnosis to initiate treatment.                                         SUMMARY               A targeted clinical history and a thorough neurologic examination with support from serologic and electrodiagnostic studies are key to early diagnosis of LEMS and botulism. Early diagnosis of both conditions creates opportunities for therapy and improves outcomes.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although the historical use of MRI in dementia diagnosis has been supportive to exclude structural etiologies, recent innovations allow for quantification of atrophy patterns that improve sensitivity for supporting the diagnosis of dementia causes. Neuronuclear approaches allow for localization of specific amyloid and tau neuropathology on PET and are available for clinical use, in addition to dopamine transporter scans in dementia with Lewy bodies and metabolic studies with fludeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET).                                         SUMMARY               Using computerized software programs for MRI analysis and cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations of hippocampal, ventricular, and lobar volumes improves sensitivity in support of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. MRI protocol requirements for such quantification are three-dimensional T1-weighted volumetric imaging protocols, which may need to be specifically requested. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and 3.0T susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences are useful for the detection of white matter hyperintensities as well as microhemorrhages in vascular dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. PET studies for amyloid and/or tau pathology can add additional specificity to the diagnosis but currently remain largely inaccessible outside of research settings because of prohibitive cost constraints in most of the world. Dopamine transporter PET scans can help identify Lewy body dementia and are thus of potential clinical value.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and stabilization exercises in an attempt to prevent fatigue and improve muscle activation in patients with lumbar disk herniation associated with low back pain. METHODS: This study involved 29 patients (age range 25-58 years) randomized into 2 groups: the segmental stabilization group (n = 15), who received stabilization exercises on the transversus abdominis (TrA) and lumbar multifidus muscles; and the TENS group (n = 14), who received electrotherapy. Groups underwent 16 sessions, for 60 minutes, twice per week, and they were evaluated before and after intervention. Pain was measured using a visual analog scale, functional disability using the Oswestry Disability Index, muscle activation and fatigue with electromyography, and patients' ability to contract the TrA with a pressure biofeedback unit. Analyses within and between groups were performed. RESULTS: The stabilization group improved lumbar multifidus fatigue (median frequency [MF] initial [P = .002], MF final [P {$<$} .001], MF slope [P = .001], and resistance time [P {$<$} .001]), ability to contract the TrA (P {$<$} .001), pain (P {$<$} .001), and functional disability (P {$<$} .001). TENS only was effective for pain (P = .012). CONCLUSION: Although it relieved pain, TENS was not effective as a single treatment to prevent fatigue, increase TrA contraction, and reduce functional disability in herniated disk patients. Stabilization exercises alone improved all measured outcomes.},

  abstract = {Genistein, an isoflavonoid, is found in a plethora of plant-based foods, and has been approved for use in various therapies. A couple of studies in adult men observed a negative correlation between genistein exposure and reproductive parameters. To assess the effects of genistein exposure on reproduction and fertility in males and females, we performed quantitative meta-analyses by pooling data from published studies on animals that assessed various reproductive parameters. Pooled analysis showed significant decreases in sperm count in males exposed to genistein during adulthood (Hedges's g~=~-2.51, p =\,0.013) and in utero (Hedges's g~=~-0.861, p =\,0.016) compared with controls. In males exposed to genistein in utero, serum testosterone levels decreased (Hedges's g~=~-6.301, p =\,0.000) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (Hedges's g~=~7.127, p =\,0.000) and FSH (Hedges's g~=~6.19, p =\,0.000) levels increased in comparison with controls. In females, the number of corpora lutea (Hedges's g~=~-2.103, p =\,0.019) and the litter size (Hedges's g~=~-1.773, p-value~=~0.000) decreased; however, female reproductive hormones remained unaffected. These meta-analyses show that genistein has detrimental effects on male reproductive system and on the progression and sustenance of pregnancy, with more pronounced adverse impact in males, particularly when exposed in utero.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Adaptive, or closed-loop, deep brain stimulation is a promising therapy that can detect ongoing circuit changes and deliver appropriate stimulation based on the patient's dominant symptom and level of dopaminergic medication.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with PD can benefit from surgical interventions that can be added to their medication regimen. These patients should be referred to comprehensive centers that offer complete multidisciplinary screening evaluation to ensure appropriate patient selection and intervention selection. With the appropriate surgical intervention and continued management from their care team, patients with PD can maximize their quality of life.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Recent functional neuroimaging studies focusing on the nonpainful symptoms of migraine have identified key areas of the central nervous system implicated in the early phases of a migraine attack. Clinical studies of spontaneous and provoked migraine attacks, together with preclinical studies using translational animal models, have led to a better understanding of the disease and the development of disease-specific and targeted therapies.                                         SUMMARY               Our knowledge of the pathophysiology of migraine has advanced significantly in the past decades. Current evidence supports our understanding of migraine as a complex cyclical brain disorder that likely results from dysfunctional sensory processing and dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Although the mechanisms of many of the neurologic complications discussed here remain unclear, our understanding of the impacts of diabetes and hypothyroidism on the nervous system and muscle, including complications of rapid correction of chronic hyperglycemia, has advanced in recent years. Recent large studies have not demonstrated a convincing association between subclinical or overt hypothyroidism and cognitive decline.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Neurologists must become familiar with the neurologic complications of endocrine disorders not only because they are common and treatable (and often reversible) but also because they may be iatrogenic, as is the case with adrenal insufficiency in the setting of long-term corticosteroid therapy.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Bell's palsy is a common outpatient problem, and while the diagnosis is usually straightforward, a number of diagnostic pitfalls can occur, and a lengthy differential diagnosis exists. Recognition and management of Bell's palsy relies on knowledge of the anatomy and function of the various motor and nonmotor components of the facial nerve. Avoiding diagnostic pitfalls relies on recognizing red flags or features atypical for Bell's palsy, suggesting an alternative cause of peripheral facial palsy.                                         Recent Findings:               The first American Academy of Neurology (AAN) evidence-based review on the treatment of Bell's palsy in 2001 concluded that corticosteroids were probably effective and that the antiviral acyclovir was possibly effective in increasing the likelihood of a complete recovery from Bell's palsy. Subsequent studies led to a revision of these recommendations in the 2012 evidence-based review, concluding that corticosteroids, when used shortly after the onset of Bell's palsy, were ``highly likely'' to increase the probability of recovery of facial weakness and should be offered; the addition of an antiviral to steroids may increase the likelihood of recovery but, if so, only by a very modest effect.                                         Summary:               Bell's palsy is characterized by the spontaneous acute onset of unilateral peripheral facial paresis or palsy in isolation, meaning that no features from the history, neurologic examination, or head and neck examination suggest a specific or alternative cause. In this setting, no further testing is necessary. Even without treatment, the outcome of Bell's palsy is favorable, but treatment with corticosteroids significantly increases the likelihood of improvement.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data were obtained from a cohort of 603 patients with neuropathic pain undergoing analgesic treatment with gabapentin who completed four health scales: Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, Covi Anxiety Scale, and Raskin Depression scale. After calculating MID and SEM values for all scales, patients were classified into three categories: improvement, no change, and worsening. Agreement between the two criteria was assessed using Cohen's kappa index of agreement and Kendall's tau-b linear correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The 1 SEM criterion showed the highest agreement (kappa=0.68-1.00) and correlation (tau-b=0.75-1.00) with the MID criterion. Sensitivity analysis performed in gabapentin responders and nonresponders confirmed the results of the main analysis. CONCLUSION: The 1 SEM criterion is a valid alternative to the MID criterion to evaluate the magnitude of the change produced in patient-reported health outcomes measures.},

  abstract = {Previously published results showed that both in vitro and in vivo coconut oil (CNO) treatments prevented combing damage of various hair types. Using the same methodology, an attempt was made to study the properties of mineral oil and sunflower oil on hair. Mineral oil (MO) was selected because it is extensively used in hair oil formulations in India, because it is non-greasy in nature, and because it is cheaper than vegetable oils like coconut and sunflower oils. The study was extended to sunflower oil (SFO) because it is the second most utilized base oil in the hair oil industry on account of its non-freezing property and its odorlessness at ambient temperature. As the aim was to cover different treatments, and the effect of these treatments on various hair types using the above oils, the number of experiments to be conducted was a very high number and a technique termed as the Taguchi Design of Experimentation was used. The findings clearly indicate the strong impact that coconut oil application has to hair as compared to application of both sunflower and mineral oils. Among three oils, coconut oil was the only oil found to reduce the protein loss remarkably for both undamaged and damaged hair when used as a pre-wash and post-wash grooming product. Both sunflower and mineral oils do not help at all in reducing the protein loss from hair. This difference in results could arise from the composition of each of these oils. Coconut oil, being a triglyceride of lauric acid (principal fatty acid), has a high affinity for hair proteins and, because of its low molecular weight and straight linear chain, is able to penetrate inside the hair shaft. Mineral oil, being a hydrocarbon, has no affinity for proteins and therefore is not able to penetrate and yield better results. In the case of sunflower oil, although it is a triglyceride of linoleic acid, because of its bulky structure due to the presence of double bonds, it does not penetrate the fiber, consequently resulting in no favorable impact on protein loss.},

This study investigated the duration, mechanisms, body locations and types of gradual-onset injuries in a sample of New Zealand surfers. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional online survey. METHODS: Self-identified surfers reported gradual-onset surfing-related injuries experienced in the preceding 12 months. RESULTS: Respondents (n=1473, age range 8-74 years) reported a total of 550 gradual-onset major injuries: 44\% acute duration ({$<$}3 months) and 56\% chronic ({$\geq$}3 months). The injury incidence proportion was 27\%. Shoulder (146 injuries, 64\% chronic), low back (115 injuries, 58\% chronic) and neck (105 injuries, 46\% chronic) were the most commonly reported injury locations. Prolonged paddling was the most commonly reported mechanism of injury (40\% of all injuries). Incidence proportion for gradual-onset major injuries was 6\% higher for greater surfing abilities compared to lower abilities (p=0.01), and 13\% higher for long boarders compared to short boarders (p=0.001). Respondents reporting any gradual-onset surfing injury, compared to those with no injury, averaged 3 more years surfing experience (p{$<$}0.001), were 3 years older (p{$<$}0.001), and reported 43h more surfing exposure in the preceding 12 months (p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The most common gradual-onset surfing injuries involved the shoulder, low back, and neck, most frequently attributable to paddling. Risk factors for these injuries included board type, higher ability, older age, more hours/year, and years of surfing. These findings affirm the existence of sufficient injury burden to justify investigation of surfing injury prevention initiatives.},

  abstract = {In conclusion, instability as a cause of shoulder pain in the young athlete is a difficult and often missed diagnosis. These young patients often seek treatment of shoulder pain but do not recall any episodes of shoulder instability. As a result, these uncommon, poorly described forms of instability are often misdiagnosed. A heightened clinical suspicion and an accurate, prompt diagnosis of instability is of paramount importance in this athletic group. It dictates appropriate treatment of the condition, avoids treatment delays and failure, provides better outcomes, and ensures timely return to play. UPS and MDI are two forms of this diagnosis. In UPS, patients at risk are young hyperlax athletes with a history of direct trauma or forceful overextension of the shoulder. They have shoulder pain that is described as deep anterior, reproduced with an anterior apprehension test and relieved with a relocation test. Soft tissue and/or bony lesions consistent with instability (observed on imaging or at arthroscopy) are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of UPS. Once the diagnosis is made, standard arthroscopic techniques with labrum reinsertion and/or anteroinferior capsule plication can lead to predictable good results and return to sport. In MDI, patients at risk are also young hyperlax athletes. However, these patients often do not have a history of trauma. They have shoulder pain that is often somewhat vague in location and is reproduced with a sulcus and/or hyper abduction test. Soft tissue and/or bony lesions consistent with instability are uncommon, with the exception of capsular laxity. The mainstay of treatment is physiotherapy rehabilitation. When surgery is necessary, open capsular shift and arthroscopic capsular plication are effective.},

The secondary objective was to investigate which palpatory clinical tests of sacroiliac mobility exist in the literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Medline, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database were searched. There was no restriction on the study design or participants. The data extracted from each study were sample size, study deign, and clinical test used. If there was information on reliability values, number of examiners, concurrent validity values, gold standard used, or inferential statistical test used, that was also extracted. For intraexaminer reliability, the data were expressed as {$\kappa$} values that were meta-analyzed using random effects. RESULTS: Fifteen palpatory clinical tests of sacroiliac mobility were identified from 28 studies; 14 studies performed inferential statistical analysis, all including analysis of interexaminer reliability, with {$\kappa$} values ranging from -0.05 to 0.77. Analysis of intraexaminer reliability was performed in 8 studies, with {$\kappa$} values ranging from 0.08 to 0.73. No study included in this systematic review verified the concurrent validity of the tests. Our meta-analysis of intraexaminer reliability showed moderate to good agreement results for the Gillet test ({$\kappa$}\,=\,0.46), the standing flexion test ({$\kappa$}\,=\,0.61), and the sitting flexion test ({$\kappa$}\,=\,0.68). CONCLUSION: We found 15 palpatory clinical tests of sacroiliac mobility in this systematic review. According to our meta-analysis, only the sitting flexion test obtained a good and statistically significant intraexaminer agreement. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the reliability and validity of these tests.},

RECENT FINDINGS               With a lifetime prevalence estimated at 2.5\%, OCD is a common condition that can also present comorbidly with neurologic disease. The core symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive repetitive thoughts, urges, images, or impulses that trigger anxiety and that the individual is not able to suppress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts occurring in response to an obsession with the intention of reducing the distress caused by obsessions. Neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and pharmacologic studies suggest that the expression of OCD symptoms is associated with dysfunction in a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit. Evidence-based treatments for OCD comprise pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line drugs recommended for OCD, but significant differences exist in their use for OCD compared to their use for other mood and anxiety conditions, including the need for higher dosage, longer trials necessitated by a longer lag for therapeutic response, and typically lower response rates. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, based on the principles of exposure and response prevention, shows results superior to pharmacologic treatments with lower relapse rates on long-term follow-up and thus should be considered in the treatment plan of every patient with OCD.                                         SUMMARY               OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are frequently encountered in the neurologic clinic setting and require a high index of suspicion to effectively screen for them and an illness-specific therapeutic approach.},

DATA SOURCES: Information was drawn from an extensive MEDLINE search of the scientific literature conducted in the areas of proprioception, neuromuscular control, and mechanisms of functional joint stability for the years 1970 through 1999. An emphasis was placed on defining pertinent nomenclature based on the original references. DATA SYNTHESIS: Afferent proprioceptive input is conveyed to all levels of the central nervous system. They serve fundamental roles in optimal motor control and sensorimotor control over functional joint stability. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATIONS: Sensorimotor control over the dynamic restraints is a complex process that involves components traditionally associated with motor control. Recognizing and understanding the complexities involved will facilitate the continued development and institution of management strategies based on scientific rationales.},

  abstract = {Tendinopathy can be resistant to treatment and often recurs, implying that current treatment approaches are suboptimal. Rehabilitation programmes that have been successful in terms of pain reduction and return to sport outcomes usually include strength training. Muscle activation can induce analgesia, improving self-efficacy associated with reducing one's own pain. Furthermore, strength training is beneficial for tendon matrix structure, muscle properties and limb biomechanics. However, current tendon rehabilitation may not adequately address the corticospinal control of the muscle, which may result in altered control of muscle recruitment and the consequent tendon load, and this may contribute to recalcitrance or symptom recurrence. Outcomes of interest include the effect of strength training on tendon pain, corticospinal excitability and short interval cortical inhibition. The aims of this concept paper are to: (1) review what is known about changes to the primary motor cortex and motor control in tendinopathy, (2) identify the parameters shown to induce neuroplasticity in strength training and (3) align these principles with tendon rehabilitation loading protocols to introduce a combination approach termed as tendon neuroplastic training. Strength training is a powerful modulator of the central nervous system. In particular, corticospinal inputs are essential for motor unit recruitment and activation; however, specific strength training parameters are important for neuroplasticity. Strength training that is externally paced and akin to a skilled movement task has been shown to not only reduce tendon pain, but modulate excitatory and inhibitory control of the muscle and therefore, potentially tendon load. An improved understanding of the methods that maximise the opportunity for neuroplasticity may be an important progression in how we prescribe exercise-based rehabilitation in tendinopathy for pain modulation and potentially restoration of the corticospinal control of the muscle-tendon complex.},

  abstract = {Degeneration of the intervertebral discs (IVDs) is a major contributor to back, neck and radicular pain. IVD degeneration is characterized by increases in levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6 and IL-17 secreted by the IVD cells; these cytokines promote extracellular matrix degradation, chemokine production and changes in IVD cell phenotype. The resulting imbalance in catabolic and anabolic responses leads to the degeneration of IVD tissues, as well as disc herniation and radicular pain. The release of chemokines from degenerating discs promotes the infiltration and activation of immune cells, further amplifying the inflammatory cascade. Leukocyte migration into the IVD is accompanied by the appearance of microvasculature tissue and nerve fibres. Furthermore, neurogenic factors, generated by both disc and immune cells, induce expression of pain-associated cation channels in the dorsal root ganglion. Depolarization of these ion channels is likely to promote discogenic and radicular pain, and reinforce the cytokine-mediated degenerative cascade. Taken together, an enhanced understanding of the contribution of cytokines and immune cells to these catabolic, angiogenic and nociceptive processes could provide new targets for the treatment of symptomatic disc disease. In this Review, the role of key inflammatory cytokines during each of the individual phases of degenerative disc disease, as well as the outcomes of major clinical studies aimed at blocking cytokine function, are discussed.},

This article reviews the importance of proper diagnosis, natural history, and management of headache disorders in pregnant and postpartum women.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Red flags for secondary headache specifically among pregnant women include elevated blood pressure and lack of a previous headache history, as well as a prolonged duration of the headache attack in those with a prior history of migraine. Migraine improvement is typical for most pregnant women, but the prognosis for women who have migraine with aura or chronic migraine is less predictable. Migraine is now an established risk factor for the development of preeclampsia. Recent data suggest hazards for compounds containing butalbital and possibly a better safety profile for triptans than previously believed during pregnancy. Peripheral nerve blocks and noninvasive neurostimulation devices are procedural and emerging therapies that have promising safety profiles for pregnant women with headache disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Acute headache occurring in pregnancy and the postpartum period is a red flag requiring diagnostic vigilance. Migraine frequency in women typically improves during pregnancy, although this trend is less certain when aura is present and after delivery. Acute and preventive treatment plans during pregnancy and lactation are plausible but may require shifts in therapeutic hierarchy. Relatively safe oral, parenteral, and procedural therapies are available for pregnant women. Noninvasive neuromodulation devices are already available and will likely play a greater role in the coming years. Migraine is associated with medical and obstetrical complications during pregnancy, and women with frequent migraine attacks may need to be considered high risk.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Most cases of trigeminal neuralgia are related to vascular compression, a demyelinating plaque, or a compressive mass affecting the trigeminal nerve. However, recent studies have shown that up to 11\% of patients have a family history of trigeminal neuralgia, suggesting that some patients may have a genetic predisposition to demyelination or nerve hyperexcitability. In these patients, trigeminal neuralgia may occur at a younger age, on both sides of the face, or in combination with other neuralgias.                                         SUMMARY               When a patient presents with neuralgic pain, the diagnosis is made by careful history and neurologic examination, with attention to the dermatome involved, the triggers, and the presence of any associated sensory deficit. All patients with new neuralgia or neuropathic facial pain warrant a careful evaluation for a secondary cause. The presence of sensory deficit on bedside examination is particularly concerning for an underlying secondary etiology.},

  abstract = {When simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses, the usual approach in the context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al~(2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making~k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this article, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on three clinical trial case studies.},

In one study, 21 physically active men strength trained for 12 weeks (2 days per week), with either 10 min of CWI or active recovery (ACT) after each training session. Strength and muscle mass increased more in the ACT group than in the CWI group (P {$<$} 0.05). Isokinetic work (19\%), type II muscle fibre cross-sectional area (17\%) and the number of myonuclei per fibre (26\%) increased in the ACT group (all P {$<$} 0.05), but not the CWI group. In another study, nine active men performed a bout of single-leg strength exercises on separate days, followed by CWI or ACT. Muscle biopsies were collected before and 2, 24 and 48 h after exercise. The number of satellite cells expressing neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (10-30\%) and paired box protein (Pax7) (20-50\%) increased 24-48 h after exercise with ACT. The number of NCAM(+) satellite cells increased 48 h after exercise with CWI. NCAM(+) - and Pax7(+) -positive satellite cell numbers were greater after ACT than after CWI (P {$<$} 0.05). Phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase(Thr421/Ser424) increased after exercise in both conditions but was greater after ACT (P {$<$} 0.05). These data suggest that CWI attenuates the acute changes in satellite cell numbers and activity of kinases that regulate muscle hypertrophy, which may translate to smaller long-term training gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy. The use of CWI as a regular post-exercise recovery strategy should be reconsidered.},

Wrist arthroscopy can be diagnostic and therapeutic for ulnar-sided wrist pain. Two systematic reviews showed equivalent outcomes between open and arthroscopic repair of the TFCC. There is scant proof to advise one technique over the other in clinical practice. TFCC repair and reconstruction are contraindicated when there is a bony deformation of the radius or ulna or osteoarthritis of the DRUJ. With the advancement of implant arthroplasty, salvage procedures are less desirable. Constrained distal radioulnar arthroplasty is stable, and the longevity is encouraging.},

Due to the high degree of variability in their presentation and outcomes, treatment must be tailored according to factors such as patient demographics, the severity of the damage, and long-term improvement profile. When it comes to ACL injuries, low-quality data have been produced that reveals no difference in patient-reported knee function results between surgical ACL restoration and conservative therapy. However, these results must be evaluated in the perspective of the fact that many individuals with an ACL rupture remained symptomatic after rehabilitation and eventually underwent ACL reconstruction surgery.

A background will be provided, and information on the combined complex knee injuries, selected aspects of surgical treatments, and rehabilitation strategies will be presented. Combined complex ligament injuries are devastating injuries and are not very common compared to other knee injuries. No meta-analysis or systematic review studies exist regarding the best treatments for these patients. This article's emphasis is on the stages in the rehabilitation program with documentation of the scientific and clinical rationale for the treatment techniques in each stage. Treatment interventions are described and documented with the limited evidence available in treating these patients. Guidelines for treatment, surgery, and a clinical protocol for treating patients with combined complex ligament injuries are provided for the practicing clinician to use as a template for treating these complicated patients.},

He had exhibited clinical and radiographic signs of paranasal sinusitis. Before his physiotherapy, the patient received standard treatment with natural and synthetic antibiotics and steroids. After acute signs of infection resolved without any functional improvement, the patient was referred to a rehabilitation unit to undergo neuromuscular re-education of the paralyzed extraocular muscles. Periorbital hydrocortisone iontophoresis and visuomotor exercises with intense ideomotor stimulation led to complete and rapid resolution of extraocular muscle paralysis and diplopia. Physiotherapy can be an effective treatment of choice after failed pharmacological treatment in patients with damage to cranial nerves III and VI. It has many theoretical advantages, including noninvasiveness and avoidance of first-pass metabolism of drugs administered systemically.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The most recent guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease were published in 2020 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Rheumatology.                                         SUMMARY               The most common neurologic complications of Lyme disease are cranial neuritis (most often a unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy), meningitis, and radiculoneuritis/mononeuropathy multiplex. Testing for Lyme disease begins with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the ELISA is positive or borderline, Western blots should be performed for both IgM and IgG antibodies. As a general rule, in infectious diseases, an IgM antibody response is followed by an IgG antibody response. A central nervous system infection has either a CSF pleocytosis or pathogen-specific intrathecal antibody production. Lyme meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or other peripheral nervous system manifestations are treated with oral doxycycline or IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G. No additional antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome or patients with concern for chronic Lyme disease with no evidence of previous or current Lyme infection.},

The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from paraneoplastic syndromes that progress quite rapidly to unidentified genetic disorders that progress slowly over the course of decades. This article highlights the diagnostic process, including the differential diagnosis, as well as treatment approaches and symptomatic management. The pillars of treatment are physical, occupational, and speech therapy as well as counseling and discussions of disease prognosis, genetics, and reproductive choices. There are many ways to help patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and improve their quality of life.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent years have seen significant improvements in genetic testing, with reductions in cost of both Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing and increasing availability of the latter. These improvements increase clinicians' ability to identify the etiology of neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and suggest future treatments. Although no medication has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of cerebellar ataxia, research and clinical trials for these diseases are increasing.                                         SUMMARY               Neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia is characterized by dysarthria, dysmetria, oculomotor abnormalities, and ataxic gait. It has a broad differential diagnosis, and numerous options exist for managing symptoms. Although no medications have been approved specifically for cerebellar ataxia, treatment options are available to improve patients' quality of life.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Initial screening EEG has been validated as a tool to predict which patients are at risk of future seizures. However, accepted definitions of seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus encourage a treatment trial when the diagnosis on EEG is indeterminate because of periodic or rhythmic patterns or uncertain clinical correlation. Similarly, recent data have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of intracranial EEG in increasing the yield of seizure detection. EEG has additionally been validated as a diagnostic biomarker of covert consciousness, a predictive biomarker of cerebral ischemia and impending neurologic deterioration, and a prognostic biomarker of coma recovery and status epilepticus resolution. A recent randomized trial concluded that patients allocated to continuous EEG had no difference in mortality than those undergoing intermittent EEG but could not demonstrate whether this lack of difference was because of studying heterogeneous conditions, examining a monitoring tool rather than a therapeutic approach, or examining an outcome measure (mortality) perhaps more strongly associated with early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy than to a sustained response to pharmacotherapy.                                         SUMMARY               Seizures and status epilepticus are events of synchronous hypermetabolic activity that are either discrete and intermittent or, alternatively, continuous. Seizures and status epilepticus represent the far end of a continuum of ictal-interictal patterns that include lateralized rhythmic delta activity and periodic discharges, which not only predict future seizures but may be further classified as status epilepticus on the basis of intracranial EEG monitoring or a diagnostic trial of antiseizure medication therapy. In particularly challenging cases, neuroimaging or multimodality neuromonitoring may be a useful adjunct documenting metabolic crisis. Specialized uses of EEG as a prognostic biomarker have emerged in traumatic brain injury for predicting language function and covert consciousness, cardiac arrest for predicting coma recovery, and subarachnoid hemorrhage for predicting neurologic deterioration due to delayed cerebral ischemia.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The phakomatoses are a phenotypically and genetically diverse group of multisystem disorders that primarily affect the skin and central nervous system.

SUMMARY               Neurologists require a basic knowledge of and familiarity with a wide variety of neurocutaneous disorders because of the frequent involvement of the central and peripheral nervous systems.

RECENT FINDINGS               Cerebral small vessel disease is increasingly prevalent and highly heterogeneous in neuroimaging and clinical presentation. Small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, cortical microinfarcts, and white matter hyperintensity of presumed vascular origin represent the major neuroimaging markers of small vessel disease. Increasing small vessel disease burden is associated with risk of incident stroke and dementia, as well as other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Current research strategies are targeting elucidation of the mechanisms of small vessel disease pathogenesis and pursuing clinical trials of therapeutic agents to reduce the clinical manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease.                                         SUMMARY               Cerebral small vessel disease is common in aging adults and represents a major risk factor for multiple acute and chronic neurologic diseases. Increased awareness of cerebral small vessel disease as a modifiable risk factor holds potential for reducing neurologic disease morbidity and mortality across diverse populations in the United States and worldwide.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, that still lacks of a disease-modifying treatment. Consistent evidence proved the benefits of physical therapy on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients, leading the scientific community to propose physical activity as disease-modifying therapy for PD and suggesting the involvement of neurotrophic factors (NFs) as key mediators of neuroplasticity. However, the lack of standardized exercise training and methodological flaws of clinical trials have limited the evidence demonstrating the exercise-induced changes in serum and plasma neurotrophic factors concentration. A systematic search, covering 20 years of research in this field and including randomized and non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs and non-RCTs), which reported changes in serum and plasma NFs after a specific intervention, were reviewed. Pooled effect sizes (p-ESs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CIs) were calculated using a random effects model with R software. A total of 18 articles, of which exercise programs of interventions were codified in terms of type, intensity and duration adopting a standardisation methodology, were included in the systematic review. Six papers, describing the effect of different training programs on BDNF and IGF-1 levels, were included and independently analysed in two meta-analyses. Quantitative analysis for BDNF indicated a statistically significant improvement in serum concentration of PD patients (MD: 5.99~ng/mL; 95\%IC: 0.15~-11.83; I2 = 77\%) performing physical activity compared with control conditions in RCTs. Preliminary evidence supported the hypothesis that a moderate intensity aerobic exercise (MIAE) would be necessary to induce the changes in NFs. However, sensitivity analysis of meta-analysis and the few studies included in subgroup analysis did not support these results. Alongside, meta-analysis followed by sensitivity analysis revealed a potential change in serum IGF-1 (MD: 33.47~ng/mL; 95\%IC: 8.09-58.85) in PD patients performing physical activity with respect controls in RCT studies. Considering the limited evidence to support or refute the increase in NFs levels in PD patients performing physical activity, there is a need to develop a rigorous controlled randomized trial, with standardization for loading intensity of physical activity, greater sample size, and a correct stratification of PD patients to establish a well-defined correlation between physical activity and NFs levels.},

The flexion-extension angle of the knee was recorded during a range of functional activities performed as part of a circuit in and around the hospital. The functions analysed including gait, walking on slopes, stair negotiation, the use of standard and low chairs and a bath. The data were used to produce the pattern of joint angulation against the percentage of the cycle for each individual conducting each activity. Further the maximum and minimum knee joint angles and the excursion of the joint during the cycle were identified. The results indicate gait and slopes require less than 90 degrees of knee flexion, stairs and chairs 90-120 degrees of flexion and a bath approximately 135 degrees of flexion. The data suggests that 110 degrees of flexion would seem a suitable goal for the rehabilitation of motion in the knee. It is concluded that flexible electrogoniometry is a suitable and practical method for evaluating knee motion during a range of functional activities.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Specific recent advances in the study of nystagmus and saccadic intrusions include (1) improved understanding of the underlying etiologies and mechanisms of nystagmus enhanced or unmasked by provocative maneuvers such as supine position or head shaking; (2) recognition of the differences in behavior and treatment responsivity of acquired pendular nystagmus in demyelinating disease versus oculopalatal myoclonus; (3) recognition that oculopalatal myoclonus results from a dual mechanism of abnormal inferior olivary gap junction connection formation and maladaptive cerebellar learning; and (4) well-controlled clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions, such as memantine for acquired pendular nystagmus and 4-aminopyridine for downbeat nystagmus.                                         SUMMARY               Accurate recognition of nystagmus and saccadic intrusions, including familiarity with the subtleties of examination techniques that allow such eye movements to be unmasked, is critical to proper diagnosis and ultimate alleviation of the visual impairment these patients experience.},

This article provides a practical approach to the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and unruptured brain AVMs and reviews the risk of rupture, risk factors for rupture, preventive treatment options with their associated risks, and the approach of treatment versus observation for both types of vascular malformations.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, scoring systems on the risk of rupture can help with choosing preventive treatment or observation with follow-up imaging. Although the literature provides detailed information on the complication risks of preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, individualized predictions of these procedural complication risks are not yet available. With observation with imaging, growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms can be monitored, and prediction scores for growth can help determine the optimal timing of monitoring. The past years have revealed more about the risk of complications of the different treatment modalities for brain AVMs. A randomized clinical trial and prospective follow-up data have shown that preventive interventional therapy in patients with brain AVMs is associated with a higher rate of neurologic morbidity and mortality compared with observation.                                         SUMMARY               The risk of hemorrhage from both unruptured intracranial aneurysms and brain AVMs varies depending on the number of risk factors associated with hemorrhage. For both types of vascular malformations, different preventive treatment options are available, and all carry risks of complications. For unruptured intracranial aneurysms, the consideration of preventive treatment versus observation is complex, and several factors should be included in the decision making. Overall, it is recommended that patients with unruptured asymptomatic brain AVMs should be observed.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Persistent ({$>$}4 weeks) postconcussion symptoms (PPCS) are challenging for both patients and clinicians. There is uncertainty about the effect of commonly applied nonpharmacological treatments for the management of PPCS. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess and summarize evidence for outcomes related to 7 nonpharmacological interventions for PPCS in adults (aged {$>$}18 years) and provide recommendations for clinical practice. DATA SOURCES: Systematic literature searches were performed via Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PEDro, OTseeker, and Cochrane Reviews (via MEDLINE and Embase) from earliest possible publication year to March 3, 2020. The literature was searched for prior systematic reviews and primary studies. To be included, studies had to be intervention studies with a control group and focus on PPCS. STUDY SELECTION: A multidisciplinary guideline panel selected interventions based on frequency of use and need for decision support among clinicians, including early information and advice, graded physical exercise, vestibular rehabilitation, manual treatment of neck and back, oculomotor vision treatment, psychological treatment, and interdisciplinary coordinated rehabilitative treatment. To be included, studies had to be intervention studies within the areas of the predefined clinical questions, include a control group, and focus on symptoms after concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Extraction was performed independently by multiple observers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for data abstraction and data quality assessment. Included studies were assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the Cochrane Risk of Bias (randomized clinical trials) tool. Meta-analysis was performed for all interventions where possible. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled estimates of effects. The level and certainty of evidence was rated and recommendations formulated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All outcomes were planned before data collection began according to a specified protocol. The primary outcomes were the collective burden of PPCS and another outcome reflecting the focus of a particular intervention (eg, physical functioning after graded exercise intervention). RESULTS: Eleven systematic reviews were identified but did not contribute any primary studies; 19 randomized clinical trials comprising 2007 participants (1064 women [53.0\%]) were separately identified and included. Evidence for the 7 interventions ranged from no evidence meeting the inclusion criteria to very low and low levels of evidence. Recommendations were weak for early information and advice, graded physical exercise, vestibular rehabilitation, manual treatment of the neck and back, psychological treatment, and interdisciplinary coordinated rehabilitative treatment. No relevant evidence was identified for oculomotor vision treatment, so the panel provided a good clinical practice recommendation based on consensus. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on very low to low certainty of evidence or based on consensus, the guideline panel found weak scientific support for commonly applied nonpharmacological interventions to treat PPCS. Results align with recommendations in international guidelines. Intensified research into all types of intervention for PPCS is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on evoked dopamine release and activity of the ventral striatum using positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging in Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: Thirty-five participants were randomly allocated to a 36-session aerobic exercise or control intervention. Each participant underwent an functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while playing a reward task before and after the intervention to determine the effect of exercise on the activity of the ventral striatum in anticipation of reward. A subset of participants (n = 25) completed [11 C] raclopride positron emission tomography scans to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked release of endogenous dopamine in the dorsal striatum. All participants completed motor (MDS-UPDRS part III, finger tapping, Timed-up-and-go) and nonmotor assessments (Starkstein Apathy Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, reaction time, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Trail Making Test [A and B], and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) before and after the interventions. RESULTS: The aerobic group exhibited increased activity in the ventral striatum during functional magnetic resonance imaging in anticipation of 75\% probability of reward (P = 0.01). The aerobic group also demonstrated increased repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked dopamine release in the caudate nucleus (P = 0.04) and increased baseline nondisplaceable binding potential in the posterior putamen of the less affected repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation-stimulated hemisphere measured by position emission tomography (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise alters the responsivity of the ventral striatum, likely related to changes to the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, and increases evoked dopamine release in the caudate nucleus. This suggests that the therapeutic benefits of exercise are in part related to corticostriatal plasticity and enhanced dopamine release. {\copyright} 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successful return to sport after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction requires optimal physical and psychological recovery. The main validated tool to quantify a patient's psychological readiness to return to sport after this surgery is the Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scale. PURPOSE: The primary aim was to analyze the progression of the ACL-RSI score from preoperatively to 2-year follow-up. A secondary goal was to identify the factors associated with returning to the same preinjury sport. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: This prospective study included athletes older than 16 years in all sports and levels of play who underwent primary and revision isolated ACL reconstruction from 2012 to 2015 and responded to all study questionnaires at 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome was the ACL-RSI score obtained preoperatively and at 4-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up. The secondary outcomes were return to sport (running and the same preinjury sport) and various functional scores. The optimal threshold value of the ACL-RSI score for returning to the same preinjury sport was determined with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify other factors associated with returning to the same sport at 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 681 patients were analyzed (467 men, 214 women; mean age, 30.2 {\textpm} 9.5 years); 298 (43.8\%) patients were professional or competitive athletes. The ACL-RSI score improved significantly over time: 41.3 {\textpm} 25.4 preoperatively, 55.1 {\textpm} 21.3 at 4 months, 58.3 {\textpm} 22.3 at 6 months, 64.7 {\textpm} 24.2 at 1 year, and 65.2 {\textpm} 25.3 at 2 years (P {$<$} .00001). At 2-year follow-up, 74.9\% of patients had returned to running and 58.4\% to their same preinjury sport. The ACL-RSI score was significantly higher in patients who had returned to sport and in those who returned to the same level of play or higher (P {$<$} .00001). The optimal ACL-RSI score threshold to return to the same sport at 2-year follow-up was {$\geq$}65. Multivariate analysis showed that the predictive factors of returning to the same preinjury sport at 2-year follow-up were primary reconstruction, professional or competitive level of play, an ACL-RSI score {$\geq$}60 at 6-month follow-up, and the absence of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: The psychological ACL-RSI score improved regularly after ACL reconstruction and was strongly and significantly associated with return to sport.

As health care professionals, you will often encounter women of childbearing age who may be pregnant, or you may have children of your own, or maybe it is a friend who is pregnant. In any case, pregnancy and childbirth are relevant to all of us, and unfortunately, these processes often culminate in negative outcomes. For example, 50\% of all embryos are spontaneously aborted. Furthermore, prematurity and birth defects are the leading causes of infant mortality and major contributors to disabilities. Fortunately, new strategies can improve pregnancy outcomes, and health care professionals have a major role to play in implementing these initiatives. However, a basic knowledge of embryology is essential to the success of these strategies, and with this knowledge, every health care professional can play a role in providing healthier babies. To accomplish its goal of providing a basic understanding of embryology and its clinical relevance, Langman's Medical Embryology retains its unique approach of combining an economy of text with excellent diagrams and clinical images.

RECENT FINDINGS: Specific autoimmune vestibulocerebellar syndromes may now be tested for, and this article discusses the antibodies known to cause such syndromes. Superficial siderosis can be more accurately diagnosed with imaging studies, and treatment using iron chelation has recently been studied but has not yet been established as an effective treatment. Central autonomic network damage in the brain can cause central orthostatic hypotension in some neurodegenerative diseases, and medication has been approved for treatment. SUMMARY: CNS causes of vertigo are numerous and important for clinicians to recognize. Examination findings are still an extremely valuable way to diagnose central vertigo; therefore, learning how to differentiate central from peripheral vertigo based on examination is an important skill.

This article reviews the pathophysiology, etiology and risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes of spontaneous cervical artery dissection.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Cervical artery dissection is believed to be a multifactorial disease, with environmental factors serving as possible triggers in patients who have a genetic predisposition to dissection formation. Cervical artery dissection can cause local symptoms or ischemic events, such as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Neuroimaging is used to confirm the diagnosis; classic findings include a long tapered arterial stenosis or occlusion, dissecting aneurysm, intimal flap, double lumen, or intramural hematoma. Patients with cervical artery dissection who present with an acute ischemic stroke should be evaluated for IV thrombolysis, endovascular therapy eligibility, or both. Antithrombotic therapy with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment is used to prevent stroke from cervical artery dissection. The risk of recurrent ischemia appears low and is mostly limited to the first two weeks after symptom onset.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               Cervical artery dissection is a known cause of ischemic strokes. Current data show no difference between the benefits and risks of anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy in the acute phase of symptomatic extracranial cervical artery dissection, thereby supporting the recommendation that clinicians can prescribe either treatment. Further research is warranted to better understand the pathophysiology and long-term outcomes of cervical artery dissection.},

METHODS: Between 2008 and 2013, 6 patients were referred to our hospital with chest injuries sustained during surfing. Clinical data were collected from their medical records and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 35 to 52 years. Five of the 6 patients were male. Four patients were injured in August, and the other two were injured in September and October. Rib fractures were observed in 3 of the 6 patients. The other 3 patients were diagnosed with chest contusions only. Hemothorax occurred in one patient. No lacerations were observed in any of the 6 patients. CONCLUSION: Chest injuries associated with surfing are usually blunt chest injuries; however, they may occasionally be life-threatening.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Whereas neurologic complications from traditional chemotherapy are widely recognized, newer cancer therapies, in particular immunotherapies, have unique and distinct patterns of neurologic adverse effects. Anticancer drugs may cause central or peripheral nervous system complications. Neurologic complications of therapy are being seen with increasing frequency as patients with cancer are living longer and receiving multiple courses of anticancer regimens, with novel agents, combinations, and longer duration. Neurologists must know how to recognize treatment-related neurologic toxicity since discontinuation of the offending agent or dose adjustment may prevent further or permanent neurologic injury. It is also imperative to differentiate neurologic complications of therapy from cancer progression into the nervous system and from comorbid neurologic disorders that do not require treatment dose reduction or discontinuation.                                         SUMMARY               Neurotoxicity from cancer therapy is common, with effects seen on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy are new cancer treatments with distinct patterns of neurologic complications. Early recognition and appropriate management are essential to help prevent further neurologic injury and optimize oncologic management.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether lumbar spine flexion during lifting is a risk factor for low back pain (LBP) onset/persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP. DESIGN: Etiology systematic review with meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: Database search of ProQuest, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase up to August 21, 2018. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: We included peer-reviewed articles that investigated whether lumbar spine position during lifting was a risk factor for LBP onset or persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lifting-task comparison data were tabulated and summarized. The meta-analysis calculated an n-weighted pooled mean {\textpm} SD of the results in the LBP and no-LBP groups. If a study contained multiple comparisons (ie, different lifting tasks that used various weights or directions), then only 1 result from that study was included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Four studies (1 longitudinal study and 3 cross-sectional studies across 5 articles) included in meta-analysis measured lumbar flexion with intralumbar angles and found no difference in peak lumbar spine flexion when lifting (1.5{$^\circ$}; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.7{$^\circ$}, 3.7{$^\circ$}; P = .19 for the longitudinal study and -0.9{$^\circ$}; 95\% CI: -2.5{$^\circ$}, 0.7{$^\circ$}; P = .29 for the cross-sectional studies). Seven cross-sectional studies measured lumbar flexion with thoracopelvic angles and found that people with LBP lifted with 6.0{$^\circ$} less lumbar flexion than people without LBP (95\% CI: -11.2{$^\circ$}, -0.9{$^\circ$}; P = .02). Most (9/11) studies reported no significant between-group differences in lumbar flexion during lifting. The included studies were of low quality. CONCLUSION: There was low-quality evidence that greater lumbar spine flexion during lifting was not a risk factor for LBP onset/persistence or a differentiator of people with and without LBP.

Coconut sugar is a healthier, sweetener option than the majority of other sugars that are commercially available. Sap is collected from trees to be transported, stored, and evaporated during processing, which are labor- and resource-intensive operations. Consequently, the cost of production is higher than it is for cane sugar. Given its high nutritional value and low glycemic index, people are willing to pay higher prices for it. However, one barrier is ignorance of its health benefits. This review examines and deals in-depth with the most significant features of coconut sugar chemical analyses to focus on several analytical methodologies given the increasing demand for naturally derived sweeteners in the last 10 years. A deeper understanding of the quality control, safety, health effects, nutritional profile, and sustainability issues corresponding to coconut sugar is necessary to effectively implement them in the food industry.},

SETTING: Tertiary care, institutional. PATIENTS: Inclusion criteria included patients who presented with unilateral knee pain and were seen by pediatric sports medicine physicians. Patients were excluded if their knee pain was related to any underlying conditions. Three hundred patient charts were reviewed, and 183 patients (age range: 8-18 years, mean: 14 years; 74 male) met the inclusion criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Symptoms at initial visit (knee pain). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of a meniscal tear using the McMurray test. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent (160/191) of patients had a McMurray test documented as performed by the physician, and 17\% (27/160) elucidated a positive response. Of 26 patients who had a positive McMurray and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 16 (62\%) showed a meniscal tear on their MRI. However, of the 87 patients who had a negative McMurray and still underwent MRI, 25 (29\%) had a positive meniscal tear. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 39\%, 86\%, 62\%, and 71\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In a pediatric and adolescent population, the McMurray test was negative for 61\% (23/38) of meniscal tears identified on MRI. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although the test can be a useful tool as a part of a thorough evaluation, combining it with mechanical symptoms, patient history and imaging may be more helpful to diagnose a meniscus tear.},

We have also described the terminologies that have been replaced, redefined or removed to have a clear view of the previous and the current classification models. We have recommended the use of multidimensional classification model which incorporated the clinical semiology, disease location, etiology and associated comorbidities. The benefits of this model is for prompt diagnosis which will results into early management and then better patient outcomes. It would also have a profound effects on the kind of treatment patients might receive especially in developing countries where there are scarcity of the diagnostic techniques.

The major neurosurgical subspecialty procedures (cerebrovascular neurosurgery, neuro-oncology, epilepsy neurosurgery, functional neurosurgery, CSF diversion, endovascular neurosurgery, and spinal surgery) are broadly included under craniotomy procedures, endovascular/vascular procedures, and spinal procedures. This article focuses on the range of complications inherent in these approaches with specific scenarios addressed as applicable.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The morbidity and mortality related to neurosurgical procedures remains high, necessitating ongoing research and quality improvement efforts in perioperative screening, intraoperative management, surgical approaches, and postoperative care of these patients. Emerging research continues to investigate safer and newer options for routine neurosurgical approaches, such as coiling over clipping for amenable aneurysms, endoscopic techniques for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, and minimally invasive spinal procedures; postoperative monitoring and care of patients after these procedures continues to be a key component in the continuum of care for improving outcomes.

These rare diagnoses include cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. Recent investigations have led to an understanding of the autoimmune underpinnings of these conditions and their specific associated antibodies. As the presentation of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes includes muscle stiffness, twitches, and spasms, which are also shared with certain central nervous system and myopathic conditions, the differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes is reviewed.                                         Recent Findings:               Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes share clinical and electrodiagnostic evidence of motor nerve instability; however, their clinical presentations are varied. Case reviews have helped us understand the spectrum of symptoms associated with the three peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes reviewed here: cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, and Morvan syndrome. More recently, research has focused on understanding the voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies as well as neoplasms associated with these conditions.                                         Summary:               The diagnosis of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes requires a high index of suspicion, support from the physical examination, familiarity with the spectrum of symptoms associated with peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndromes, and recognition of diagnostic EMG features. Voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies are associated with these conditions. Optimum treatment and autoimmune pathogenesis remain areas of active research.},

However, neurologic complications of HIV remain common; can affect any part of the neuraxis; and are due to direct effects of the virus, immunosuppression because of untreated HIV infection, aberrant immune responses in the setting of ART initiation, and ART toxicities.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains one of the most common neurologic complications of HIV encountered today, but milder forms predominate in people on ART. No specific treatments for HAND exist, but small trials and epidemiologic evidence suggest paroxetine, intranasal insulin, and maraviroc may have utility in its treatment; further trials of these agents are ongoing. Widespread ART use has decreased the incidence of central nervous system opportunistic infections, but prognosis often remains poor in those who develop opportunistic infections. High-titer positive serum cryptococcal antigen is strongly predictive of cryptococcal meningitis and provides a tool to enhance diagnosis in areas with limited resources. HIV is an independent risk factor for stroke, and accelerated aging associated with HIV infection results in neurologic diseases of older age occurring at much younger ages in individuals infected with HIV. Ongoing HIV replication in the CSF despite peripheral virologic suppression may contribute to the development of HAND and may not improve despite adjusting the ART regimen to increase central nervous system penetrance.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists are likely to encounter patients infected with HIV in clinical practice.

RECENT FINDINGS                                Central nervous system (CNS) TB remains common and associated with significant mortality and neurologic sequelae worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is strongly associated with both the development of and mortality due to CNS TB.                 Strongyloides                 co-infection is associated with reduced CNS inflammation and improved outcomes in the setting of tuberculous meningitis. Stroke remains a common complication of tuberculous meningitis, and emerging evidence suggests aspirin may be used in this context. Although a recent nucleic acid amplification test has demonstrated suboptimal sensitivity in the diagnosis of CNS TB, emerging diagnostic techniques include cell-free DNA, peripheral blood microRNA, metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and advanced imaging techniques, but these are not yet well validated. CNS TB is associated with high mortality even with current treatment regimens, although novel, promising strategies for treatment are under investigation, including a combination of IV isoniazid and ethambutol and high-dose rifampicin.                                                        SUMMARY               TB can affect the nervous system in various ways and is associated with high mortality. Diagnosis remains challenging in endemic settings, with empiric treatment often initiated without a definitive diagnosis. Furthermore, optimal treatment regimens remain uncertain because current treatment for all forms of CNS TB is extrapolated from trials of tuberculous meningitis whereas the role of steroids in people with HIV and tuberculous meningitis remains controversial.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle hypertrophy can be induced by hormones and growth factors acting directly as positive regulators of muscle growth or indirectly by neutralizing negative regulators, and by mechanical signals mediating the effect of resistance exercise. Muscle growth during hypertrophy is controlled at the translational level, through the stimulation of protein synthesis, and at the transcriptional level, through the activation of ribosomal RNAs and muscle-specific genes. mTORC1 has a central role in the regulation of both protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis. Several transcription factors and co-activators, including MEF2, SRF, PGC-1{$\alpha$}4, and YAP promote the growth of the myofibers. Satellite cell proliferation and fusion is involved in some but not all muscle hypertrophy models.},

Estimates of associations of NHL with 21 pesticide chemical groups and 80 active ingredients were extracted from 44 papers, all of which reported results from analyses of studies conducted in high-income countries. Random effects meta-analyses showed that phenoxy herbicides, carbamate insecticides, organophosphorus insecticides and the active ingredient lindane, an organochlorine insecticide, were positively associated with NHL. In a handful of papers, associations between pesticides and NHL subtypes were reported; B cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicides and the organophosphorus herbicide glyphosate. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positively associated with phenoxy herbicide exposure. Despite compelling evidence that NHL is associated with certain chemicals, this review indicates the need for investigations of a larger variety of pesticides in more geographic areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which, despite producing a large portion of the world's agriculture, were missing in the literature that were reviewed.},

Further, tests that are under development and likely to be used in the future are identified.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Technical improvements in assay sensitivity and precision have led to the rapid development of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) over the past several years. Studies have found that the ratio of amyloid-{$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) peptides (A{$\beta$}42/A{$\beta$}40) and concentrations of phosphorylated tau isoforms in plasma can identify individuals with AD brain pathology. Blood-based tests may enable much broader use of AD biomarkers in the evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment.                                         SUMMARY               Even after a detailed history, examination, routine laboratory testing, and brain imaging, the cause of dementia sometimes remains unclear. CSF and blood-based biomarkers can evaluate for a range of neurologic disorders that are associated with dementia, including AD. Integrating data from fluid biomarker tests and the routine dementia evaluation may improve the accuracy of dementia diagnosis.},

This article also discusses the underlying proteinopathies of neurodegenerative diseases (eg, amyloid-{$\beta$}, paired helical filament tau, {$\alpha$}-synuclein, and TDP-43 pathology) and vascular pathologies, including tissue injury (eg, infarcts, hemorrhages) with or without vessel disease.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                New criteria for AD pathologic diagnosis highlight amyloid-{$\beta$} as the                 sine qua non                 of AD; they require molecular markers of amyloid and establish a minimum threshold of Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage 3. Pathologic diagnosis is separated from clinical disease (ie, pathologic diagnosis no longer requires dementia). TDP-43 pathology, a major pathology in a frontotemporal dementia subtype, was found as a central pathology in LATE, a newly named amnestic disorder. Multiple pathologies (often co-occurring with AD) contribute to dementia and add complexity to the clinical picture. Conversely, Lewy body, LATE, and vascular dementias often have accompanying AD pathology. Pathology and biomarker studies highlight subclinical pathologies in older people without cognitive impairment. This resilience to brain pathology is common and is known as                 cognitive reserve                 .                                                        SUMMARY               The pathologies of dementia in aging are most commonly amyloid, tangles, Lewy bodies, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, and vascular pathologies. These pathologies often co-occur (mixed pathologies), which may make specific clinical diagnoses difficult. In addition, dementia-related pathologies are often subclinical, suggesting varying levels of resilience in older people.},

  abstract = {Correlation in the broadest sense is a measure of an association between variables. In correlated data, the change in the magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction. Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation coefficients are scaled such that they range from -1 to +1, where 0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the relationship in the population from which the data were sampled. The aim of this tutorial is to guide researchers and clinicians in the appropriate use and interpretation of correlation coefficients.},

Bodybuilders generally train with moderate loads and fairly short rest intervals that induce high amounts of metabolic stress. Powerlifters, on the other hand, routinely train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest periods between sets. Although both groups are known to display impressive muscularity, it is not clear which method is superior for hypertrophic gains. It has been shown that many factors mediate the hypertrophic process and that mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all can play a role in exercise-induced muscle growth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: (a) to extensively review the literature as to the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to exercise training and (b) to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal protocol for maximizing muscle growth.},

The aim of this study was to compare three-dimensional knee kinematics and gait characteristics of MLKR patients to healthy controls during level walking. METHODS: Three-dimensional optoelectronic motion capture during overground walking was performed on 16 patients with MLKR and a group of healthy controls matched individually to each patient for age, gender, height and weight. Three-dimensional knee angles were extracted from the weight acceptance and propulsion sub-phases of gait. Statistical analysis was performed using group-aggregated data, as well as for each patient-control pair using a single-case approach. RESULTS: Although group analysis detected few differences, single-case analysis revealed significant differences for a proportion of patients for all dependent variables during weight acceptance and propulsion sub-phases of stance. These kinematic differences occurred in the context of reduced gait velocity, step length and cadence, as well as increased time spent in double support. CONCLUSION: Patients with MLKR display abnormalities in knee kinematics during gait at an average of 4.5~years after surgery. The pattern of kinematic abnormalities appears individual specific and may not be related to differences in spatiotemporal gait characteristics. The current findings describe detailed functional outcomes of MLKR reconstruction at average medium-term follow-up that provide improved prognostic information for clinicians to counsel patients with these types of injuries.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PCA is usually an atypical form of Alzheimer disease with relatively young age at onset. New diagnostic criteria allow patients to be diagnosed on a syndromic basis as having a primary visual (pure) form or more complex (plus) form of PCA and, when possible, on a disease-specific basis using biomarkers or underlying pathology. Imaging techniques have demonstrated that some pathologic processes are concordant (atrophy, hypometabolism, tau deposition) with clinical symptoms and some are discordant (widespread amyloid deposition). International efforts are under way to establish the genetic underpinnings of this typically sporadic form of Alzheimer disease. In the absence of specific disease-modifying therapies, a number of practical suggestions can be offered to patients and their families to facilitate reading and activities of daily living, promote independence, and improve quality of life                                         SUMMARY               While rare, PCA is an important diagnostic entity for neurologists, ophthalmologists, and optometrists to recognize to allow for early accurate diagnosis and appropriate patient management.

RECENT FINDINGS               Current research in psychotic disorders has focused increasingly on negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in psychotic illness, as it is now recognized that these cause the greatest impact on functional deficits for patients. A number of new medications have also been introduced to target negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in psychotic illness.

RECENT FINDINGS               Lifestyle modifications and migraine trigger avoidance are recommended as preventive measures for all individuals with migraine. The decision to recommend additional migraine preventive therapy should consider the frequency of migraine attacks and headaches, extent of migraine-associated disability, frequency of using acute migraine treatments and the responsiveness to such treatments, and patient preferences. Additional therapies include prescription medications, nutraceuticals, neurostimulation, and behavioral therapy. Considering evidence for efficacy and the risk of potential side effects and adverse events, treatments with the most favorable profiles include (in alphabetical order): amitriptyline, beta-blockers (several), biofeedback, candesartan, coenzyme Q10, cognitive-behavioral therapy, magnesium citrate, onabotulinumtoxinA (for chronic migraine only), relaxation therapy, riboflavin, and topiramate. In addition, erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody, received  approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of migraine in May 2018.                                         SUMMARY               Successful migraine preventive therapy reduces the frequency and burden of attacks while causing limited side effects. Individual treatment recommendations are determined based upon evidence for efficacy, side effect and adverse event profiles, medication interactions, patient comorbidity, costs, and patient preferences. Patients must be counseled on reasonable expectations for their preventive therapy and the importance of adhering to the recommended treatment plan for a period of time that is sufficient to determine outcomes.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Myelopathy and myeloneuropathy due to vitamin B                 12                 deficiency is increasing in prevalence partly because of an aging population. Early recognition of the clinical symptoms and rapid initiation of treatment is essential. Copper deficiency is now also recognized as causing a similar clinical picture as vitamin B                 12                 deficiency. Conditions leading to copper deficiency include bariatric surgery and excessive zinc intake. Unusual conditions such as lathyrism and konzo are relevant to all neurologists because of emigration from less well-developed countries. Myelopathy can also occur from substance abuse (eg, heroin and nitrous oxide), and early diagnosis could lead to improved patient outcomes. The spinal cord may also be injured in decompression illness that occurs in sport divers and individuals who work in pressurized atmospheres.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite clear benefits of the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) approach to ensuring quality and consistency of care, its uptake within physiotherapy has been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: Synthesise the findings of research into EBP barriers, facilitators and interventions in physiotherapy and identify methods of enhancing adoption and implementation. DATA SOURCES: Literature concerning physiotherapists' practice between 2000 and 2012 was systematically searched using: Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, American Psychological Association databases, Medline, Journal Storage, and Science Direct. Reference lists were searched to identify additional studies. STUDY SELECTION: Thirty-two studies, focusing either on physiotherapists' EBP knowledge, attitudes or implementation, or EBP interventions in physiotherapy were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One author undertook all data extraction and a second author reviewed to ensure consistency and rigour. Synthesis was organised around the themes of EBP barriers/enablers, attitudes, knowledge/skills, use and interventions. RESULTS: Many physiotherapists hold positive attitudes towards EBP. However, this does not necessarily translate into consistent, high-quality EBP. Many barriers to EBP implementation are apparent, including: lack of time and skills, and misperceptions of EBP. LIMITATIONS: Only studies published in the English language, in peer-reviewed journals were included, thereby introducing possible publication bias. Furthermore, narrative synthesis may be subject to greater confirmation bias. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: There is no "one-size fits all" approach to enhancing EBP implementation; assessing organisational culture prior to designing interventions is crucial. Although some interventions appear promising, further research is required to explore the most effective methods of supporting physiotherapists' adoption of EBP.},

METHODS: Twenty elite male surfers had their lower-body muscle structure assessed with ultrasonography and completed a series of lower-body strength and jump tests including isometric midthigh pull (IMTP), CMJ, and SJ. Athletes were separated into stronger (n = 10) and weaker (n = 10) groups based on IMTP performance. RESULTS: Large significant differences were identified between the groups for vastus lateralis (VL) thickness (P = .02, ES = 1.22) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) pennation angle (P = .01, ES = 1.20), and a large nonsignificant difference was identified in LG thickness (P = .08, ES = 0.89). Furthermore, significant differences were present between the groups for peak force, relative peak force, and jump height in the CMJ and SJ (P {$<$} .01-.05, ES = 0.90-1.47) and eccentric peak velocity, as well as vertical displacement of the center of mass during the CMJ (P {$<$} .01, ES = 1.40-1.41). CONCLUSION: Stronger surfing athletes in this study had greater VL and LG thickness and LG pennation angle. These muscle structures may explain their better performance in the CMJ and SJ. A unique finding in this study was that the stronger group appeared to better use their strength and muscle structure for braking as they had significantly higher eccentric peak velocity and vertical displacement during the CMJ. This enhanced eccentric phase may have resulted in a greater production and subsequent utilization of stored elastic strain energy that led to the significantly better CMJ performance in the stronger group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective pain management after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction improves patient satisfaction and function. PURPOSE: To collect and evaluate the available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on pain control after ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, UpToDate, Cochrane Reviews, CINAHL, and Scopus following PRISMA guidelines (July 2014). Only RCTs comparing a method of postoperative pain control to another method or placebo were included. RESULTS: A total of 77 RCTs met inclusion criteria: 14 on regional nerve blocks, 21 on intra-articular injections, 4 on intramuscular/intravenous injections, 12 on multimodal regimens, 6 on oral medications, 10 on cryotherapy/compression, 6 on mobilization, and 5 on intraoperative techniques. Single-injection femoral nerve blocks provided superior analgesia to placebo for up to 24 hours postoperatively; however, this also resulted in a quadriceps motor deficit. Indwelling femoral catheters utilized for 2 days postoperatively provided superior analgesia to a single-injection femoral nerve block. Local anesthetic injections at the surgical wound site or intra-articularly provided equivalent analgesia to regional nerve blocks. Continuous-infusion catheters of a local anesthetic provided adequate pain relief but have been shown to cause chondrolysis. Cryotherapy improved analgesia compared to no cryotherapy in 4 trials, while in 4 trials, ice water and water at room temperature provided equivalent analgesic effects. Early weightbearing decreased pain compared to delayed weightbearing. Oral gabapentin given preoperatively and oral zolpidem given for the first week postoperatively each decreased opioid consumption as compared to placebo. Ibuprofen reduced pain compared to acetaminophen. Oral ketorolac reduced pain compared to hydrocodone-acetaminophen. CONCLUSION: Regional nerve blocks and intra-articular injections are both effective forms of analgesia. Cryotherapy-compression appears to be beneficial, provided that intra-articular temperatures are sufficiently decreased. Early mobilization reduces pain symptoms. Gabapentin, zolpidem, ketorolac, and ibuprofen decrease opioid consumption. Despite the vast amount of high-quality evidence on this topic, further research is needed to determine the optimal multimodal approach that can maximize recovery while minimizing pain and opioid consumption. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results provide the best available evidence from RCTs on pain control regimens after ACL reconstruction.},

Key aspects of management and the future of diagnosis and care for the disorder are highlighted.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               BvFTD is a clinical syndrome, not a disease. Patients with the syndrome share core symptoms that reflect degeneration within the most consistently affected brain regions, but accompanying features vary and reflect the precise topography of regional degeneration. The clinician must distinguish a bvFTD syndrome from psychiatric illness and other neurodegenerative syndromes that feature a prominent behavioral component. Antemortem prediction of pathologic diagnosis remains imperfect but improves with careful attention to the clinical details. Management should emphasize prevention of caregiver distress, behavioral and environmental strategies, symptom-based psychopharmacology, and genetic counseling.                                         SUMMARY               BvFTD is an important and challenging dementia syndrome. Although disease-modifying treatments are lacking, clinicians can have a profound impact on a family coping with this disorder. Treatment trials are under way for some genetic forms of bvFTD. For sporadic disease, pathologic heterogeneity remains a major challenge, and ongoing research seeks to improve antemortem molecular diagnosis to facilitate therapeutic discovery.},

Balance training resulted in performance improvements in both groups. Voxel-based morphometry revealed learning-dependent gray matter changes in the left hippocampus in healthy controls. In PD patients, performance improvements were correlated with gray matter changes in the right anterior precuneus, left inferior parietal cortex, left ventral premotor cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. Furthermore, a TIME {\texttimes} GROUP interaction analysis revealed time-dependent gray matter changes in the right cerebellum. Our results highlight training-induced balance improvements in PD patients that may be associated with specific patterns of structural brain plasticity. In summary, we provide novel evidence for the capacity of the human brain to undergo learning-related structural plasticity even in a pathophysiological disease state such as in PD.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            PURPOSE OF REVIEW               In recent years, we have observed the emergence and reemergence of a number of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Zika virus is the most recent addition to this group, first causing sporadic cases of uncomplicated febrile illness followed by sizeable outbreaks in the Pacific. However, the epidemiology and clinical features of Zika virus infection have changed rapidly and dramatically; it is now recognized as causing Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome (GBS) in children and adults and congenital abnormalities in infected fetuses. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of Zika virus--associated neurologic illness and briefly reviews features of West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Zika virus has emerged as a significant human pathogen in recent years. In 2015, it began to cause large outbreaks of febrile rash illness in South America and the Caribbean. During these large Zika virus outbreaks, a significant increase in the incidence of GBS was also observed in multiple countries/territories. Zika virus--associated GBS has several unique features, including a relatively short interval between febrile illness and GBS onset, an unusually high incidence among older people, and prominent cranial nerve abnormalities. Congenital Zika syndrome includes a myriad of abnormalities, including microcephaly, lissencephaly, hydrocephalus, arthrogryposis, and parenchymal calcifications. Currently, no treatment has been identified for Zika virus, although work on vaccines is under way.                                         SUMMARY               Arboviruses continue to surprise us with unexpected emergence in various locations, the nature of clinical illness, and outcomes.

  abstract = {The Newman-Keuls (NK) procedure for testing all pairwise comparisons among a set of treatment means, introduced by Newman (1939) and in a slightly different form by Keuls (1952) was proposed as a reasonable way to alleviate the inflation of error rates when a large number of means are compared. It was proposed before the concepts of different types of multiple error rates were introduced by Tukey (1952a, b; 1953). Although it was popular in the 1950s and 1960s, once control of the familywise error rate (FWER) was accepted generally as an appropriate criterion in multiple testing, and it was realized that the NK procedure does not control the FWER at the nominal level at which it is performed, the procedure gradually fell out of favor. Recently, a more liberal criterion, control of the false discovery rate (FDR), has been proposed as more appropriate in some situations than FWER control. This paper notes that the NK procedure and a nonparametric extension controls the FWER within any set of homogeneous treatments. It proves that the extended procedure controls the FDR when there are well-separated clusters of homogeneous means and between-cluster test statistics are independent, and extensive simulation provides strong evidence that the original procedure controls the FDR under the same conditions and some dependent conditions when the clusters are not well-separated. Thus, the test has two desirable error-controlling properties, providing a compromise between FDR control with no subgroup FWER control and global FWER control. Yekutieli (2002) developed an FDR-controlling procedure for testing all pairwise differences among means, without any FWER-controlling criteria when there is more than one cluster. The empirica example in Yekutieli's paper was used to compare the Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) method with apparent FDR control in this context, Yekutieli's proposed method with proven FDR control, the Newman-Keuls method that controls FWER within equal clusters with apparent FDR control, and several methods that control FWER globally. The Newman-Keuls is shown to be intermediate in number of rejections to the FWER-controlling methods and the FDR-controlling methods in this example, although it is not always more conservative than the other FDR-controlling methods.},

Changes in cervical posture and electromyography of upper trapezius, cervical extensor, and sternocleidomastoid muscles were compared between a resting seated posture at baseline, a low stress condition with mental concentration, and a high stress condition with mental concentration and psychosocial stress in sixty healthy office workers. Forward head posture significantly increased with mental concentration compared to baseline, but did not change with further introduction of the stressor. Muscle activity significantly increased from the low stress to high stress condition for both the dominant and non-dominant upper trapezius, with no corresponding change in activity of the cervical extensors or flexors between stress conditions. These findings suggest that upper trapezius muscles are selectively activated by psychosocial stress independent of changes in concentration or posture, which may have implications for the prevention of stress-related trapezius myalgia in the workplace.},

However, it is unclear of this lack of response is due to insufficient exercise stimulus, or an inability to mount a growth response. The purpose of this study was to compare paraspinal muscle gene expression between individuals with LSP who do and do not undergo an acute bout of resistance exercise. METHODS: Paraspinal muscle biopsies were obtained from 64 individuals with LSP undergoing spinal surgery. Eight participants performed an acute bout of machine-based lumbar extension resistance exercise preoperatively. Gene expression for 42 genes associated with adipogenic/metabolic, atrophic, fibrogenic, inflammatory, and myogenic pathways was measured, and differential expression between exercised and non-exercised groups was evaluated for (a) the full cohort, and (b) an age, gender, acuity, and etiology matched sub-cohort. Principal components analyses were used to identify gene expression clustering across clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: The exercised cohort demonstrated upregulation of inflammatory gene IL1B, inhibition of extracellular matrix components (increased MMP3\&9, decreased TIMP1\&3, COL1A1) and metabolic/adipogenic genes (FABP4, PPARD, WNT10B), and downregulation of myogenic (MYOD, ANKRD2B) and atrophic (FOXO3) genes compared to the non-exercised cohort, with similar patterns in the matched sub-analysis. There were no clinical phenotypes significantly associated with gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION: An acute bout of moderate-high intensity resistance exercise did not result in upregulation of myogenic genes in individuals with LSP. The response was characterized by mixed metabolic and fibrotic gene expression, upregulation of inflammation, and downregulation of myogenesis.},

  abstract = {Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis worldwide. Most patients present with an antecedent illness, most commonly upper respiratory tract infection, before the onset of progressive motor weakness. Several microorganisms have been associated with Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, most notably Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, and in 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In C jejuni-related Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, there is good evidence to support an autoantibody-mediated immune process that is triggered by molecular mimicry between structural components of peripheral nerves and the microorganism. Making a diagnosis of so-called classical Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome is straightforward; however, the existing diagnostic criteria have limitations and can result in some variants of the syndrome being missed. Most patients with Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome do well with immunotherapy, but a substantial proportion are left with disability, and death can occur. Results from the International Guillain-Barr{\'e} Syndrome Outcome Study suggest that geographical variations exist in Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, including insufficient access to immunotherapy in low-income countries. There is a need to provide improved access to treatment for all patients with Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, and to develop effective disease-modifying therapies that can limit the extent of nerve injury. Clinical trials are currently underway to investigate some of the potential therapeutic candidates, including complement inhibitors, which, together with emerging data from large international collaborative studies on the syndrome, will contribute substantially to understanding the many facets of this disease.},

While attributes of the disease have been recognized for over two centuries, gaps in knowledge remain related to its prevention and management. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge for CSVD.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS                                CSVD can be recognized by well-defined radiographic criteria, but the pathogenic mechanism behind the disease is unclear. Hypertension control remains the best-known strategy for stroke prevention in patients with CSVD, and recent guidelines provide a long-term blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg for patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, including those with stroke related to CSVD. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and may be increasingly recognized because of newer, more sensitive imaging modalities.                 Transient focal neurologic episodes                 is a relatively new term used to describe ``amyloid spells.'' Guidance on distinguishing these events from seizures and transient ischemic attacks has been published.                                                        ESSENTIAL POINTS               CSVD is prevalent and will likely be encountered by all neurologists in clinical practice. It is important for neurologists to be able to recognize CSVD, both radiographically and clinically, and to counsel patients on the prevention of disease progression. Blood pressure control is especially relevant, and strategies are needed to improve blood pressure control for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with CSVD.},

  abstract = {Anterior cruciate ligament surgery and rehabilitation have changed drastically during the past 30 years. The patellar tendon autograft fixed with buttons provides tight bone-to-bone placement of the graft and quick bony healing, which allows accelerated rehabilitation to obtain full range of motion and strength. Although surgical stability is easily reproducible, long-term patient satisfaction is difficult to guarantee. Full knee range of motion should be compared to that of the contralateral normal knee, including full hyperextension. We followed the progress of all patients to gauge the utility of our rehabilitation program. In order of importance, the lack of normal knee range of motion (within 2 degrees extension and 5 degrees of flexion compared with that of the normal knee), partial or total medial meniscectomy, partial or total lateral meniscectomy, and articular cartilage damage were related to lower subjective scores. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction must first strive to achieve full symmetrical knee range of motion before aggressive strengthening can begin. Our current perioperative rehabilitation starts at the time of injury and preoperatively includes aggressive swelling reduction, hyperextension exercises, gait training, and mental preparation. Goals after surgery are to control swelling while regaining full knee range of motion. After quadriceps strengthening goals are reached, patients can shift to sport-specific exercises. When using a graft from the contralateral knee, the conflicting goals of strengthening the donor site and achieving full knee range of motion are divided between the knees. Thus, normal range of motion and strength can be achieved more easily and more quickly than when using an ipsilateral graft. Regardless of the graft source, a systematic rehabilitation program that emphasizes the return to symmetrical knee motion, including hyperextension, is necessary to achieve the optimum result.},

METHODS: On two separate days (2-10\,days apart), participants provided their RPS ratings during clinical measures: 1)16 tasks from Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB\&M), 2)6-minute walk test (6MWT), and 3)self-paced gait speed. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) assessed between day test-retest reliability of RPS ratings. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC) addressed level of between day agreement. Spearman rank correlations (rs) quantified relationships between RPS, and general rating of perceived challenge, task-performance scores. RESULTS: Thirty participants with stroke (50\% female) participated. ICC ranged from 0.46 to 0.93 across tasks with 12/19 tasks showing ICCs above 0.75 (good test-retest reliability). SEM was 1-point for each task and SDC ranged from 2 to 4 across tasks. Concurrent validity between RPS and ratings of perceived challenge was good-to-excellent (rs ranged 0.78-0.94, p\,{$<$}\,0.01). Higher RPS (indicative of feeling less stable) was associated with lower balance performance scores on CB\&M tasks, negative relationships ranged in strength from fair to good-to-excellent in 10/16 tasks (rs ranged -0.46 to -0.81, p\,{$\leq$}\,0.01). CONCLUSIONS: RPS shows promise as a measure of balance intensity in people with stroke.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe RPS is a reliable and valid measure of balance intensity in ambulatory people with stroke.The RPS scale may be a useful clinical tool to address the gap in practice of measuring balance intensity during rehabilitation of walking balance post-stroke.},

When planning interventions it is fundamental to understand what constitutes a good QoL, a subjective construct, and what factors are important to consider from both parents' and children's perspectives. METHODS: We used a grounded theory methodology to explore parents' perspectives on the factors that are important for the QoL of their adolescents with CP. Fourteen parents were interviewed using a purposeful sampling strategy, followed by theoretical sampling until saturation was reached. RESULTS: Parents reflected on several important aspects of their children's QoL. In particular, they described how their trajectories as parents of a child with a disability have contributed to their adolescents' current well-being. Over time, parents' hopes for a cure were transformed into hopes for their child's happiness. This trajectory was influenced by the adolescents' intrinsic characteristics and the parents' strategies to overcome challenges and was informed by the parents' and their children's ability to make choices in pursuit of their preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' and parents' accounts should be considered when planning interventions for adolescents with disabilities. It is important to consider parents' personal characteristics, experiences and the strategies that have been proven to be efficacious in improving their children's QoL and to understand their need to make choices relating to participation and accessibility in order to promote QoL for this at-risk population. Implications for Rehabilitation Parents' trajectory on raising a child with a disability is important for understanding adolescents' QoL. Parents' characteristics and environmental factors influence adolescents' well-being. Hope and choice experiences by parents of children with CP are important for their children's QoL. Transition from pediatric to adult services are required to address disability-related aspects as well as adolescent needs for intimacy, sexuality and planning for their future during adolescence.},

However, numerous highly publicized observational studies of the effect of prevention on health outcomes have reported exaggerated relationships that were later contradicted by randomized controlled trials. A growing body of research has identified sources of bias in observational studies that are related to patient behaviors or underlying patient characteristics, known as the healthy user effect, the healthy adherer effect, confounding by functional status or cognitive impairment, and confounding by selective prescribing. In this manuscript we briefly review observational studies of prevention that have appeared to reach incorrect conclusions. We then describe potential sources of bias in these studies and discuss study designs, analytical methods, and sensitivity analyses that may mitigate bias or increase confidence in the results reported. More careful consideration of these sources of bias and study designs by providers can enhance evidence-based decision-making.},

  abstract = {Exercise and pain neuroscience education (PNE) have both been used as standalone treatments for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The evidence supporting PNE as an adjunct to exercise therapy is growing but remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of combining PNE and exercise for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, when compared with exercise alone. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted from inception to November 6, 2020. A quality effects model was used to meta-analyze outcomes where possible. Five high-quality randomized controlled studies (n = 460) were included in this review. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of individual studies, and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation analysis was conducted to determine the quality of evidence for each outcome. Meta-analyses were performed for pain intensity, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing using data reported between 0 and 12 weeks postintervention. Long-term outcomes ({$>$}12 weeks) were only available for 2 studies and therefore were not suitable for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed a significant difference in pain (weighted mean differences, -2.09/10; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -3.38 to -0.80; low certainty), disability (standardized mean difference, -0.68; 95\% CI, -1.17 to -0.20; low certainty), kinesiophobia (standardized mean difference, -1.20; CI, -1.84 to -0.57; moderate certainty), and pain catastrophizing (weighted mean differences, -7.72; 95\% CI, -12.26 to -3.18; very low certainty) that favoured the combination of PNE and exercise. These findings suggest that combining PNE and exercise in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain results in greater short-term improvements in pain, disability, kinesiophobia, and pain catastrophizing relative to exercise alone.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional movement screen (FMS) have been used to assess the movement patterns in daily sports practice. Some associations between FMS scores and physical variables have been found in some sports. Nevertheless, no study was conducted in surf. METHODS: Eighteen surf athletes (11 male) participated in the study (18.3{\textpm}6.3 years; 60.0{\textpm}9.6 kg; 168.6{\textpm}8.1 cm). All participants completed anthropometrics, knee-to-wall test, Functional Movement Screen, Isometric Knee Extension, Handgrip, Squat and Countermovement Jump. Based on that, this study investigated: 1) the variance of FMS scores between gender; 2) the association between FMS scores and physical variables of strength of upper and lower limbs, power of lower limbs and anthropometric variables; and 3) which FMS scores best explain the physical performance variables. RESULTS: The analysis of comparison between gender of each item of FMS showed significant statistical differences only in trunk stability push-up (P=0.01, ES=0.141). Kendall's Tau b correlation test between FMS scores and physical variables, revealed significant associations. After performed the stepwise multiple linear regression, FMS deep squat and trunk stability push-up explain 57\% of right side knee-to-wall test and the model is statistically significant (F(2,15)=13.097; P=0.001). In squat jump (height) the results show that FMS trunk stability push-up explains 50.3\% of this dimension and the model is statistically significant (F(1,16)=18.182; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FMS individual scores seems to better explain physical variables than total score. Only trunk stability push-up test seems to be a reliable indicator to predict physical performance in surf athletes.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Six randomized controlled trials undoubtedly confirmed the benefits of using endovascular thrombectomy on the clinical outcome of patients with stroke with large vessel occlusion within 6 hours from symptom onset compared with those receiving only standard medical care. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data, the number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on the modified Rankin Scale for one patient was 2.6. Recently, the concept of ``tissue window'' versus time window has proved useful for selecting patients for mechanical thrombectomy up to 24 hours from symptom onset. The DAWN (DWI or CTP Assessment With Clinical Mismatch in the Triage of Wake-Up and Late Presenting Strokes Undergoing Neurointervention) trial included patients at a median of 12.5 hours from onset and showed the largest effect in functional outcome ever described in any acute stroke treatment trial (35.5\% increase in functional independence). In DEFUSE 3 (Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution 3), patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy at a median of 11 hours after onset had a 28\% increase in functional independence and an additional 20\% absolute reduction in death or severe disability.                                         SUMMARY               For patients with acute ischemic stroke and a large vessel occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation who can be treated within 6 hours of stroke symptom onset, mechanical thrombectomy with a second-generation stent retriever or a catheter aspiration device should be indicated regardless of whether the patient received treatment with intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients with limited signs of early ischemic changes on neuroimaging. Two clinical trials completely disrupted the time window concept in acute ischemic stroke, showing excellent clinical outcomes in patients treated up to 24 hours from symptom onset. Time of ischemia is, on average, a good biomarker for tissue viability; however, the window of opportunity for treatment varies across different individuals because of a range of compensatory mechanisms. Adjusting time to the adequacy of collateral flow leads to the concept of tissue window, a paradigm shift in stroke reperfusion therapy.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The exponential growth of genetic testing is due to its increased speed and decreasing cost, and it is now a routine part of the clinical care for a number of neurologic patients. In addition, phenotypic pleiotropy (mutations in the same gene causing very disparate phenotypes) and genetic heterogeneity (the same clinical phenotype resulting from mutations in different genes) are now known to exist in a number of conditions, adding an additional layer of complexity for genetic testing in these disorders.                                         SUMMARY               Although the growing complexity of technical knowledge in the ordering and interpretation of genetic tests makes it necessary for neurologists to consult medical geneticists, limitations in the availability of such professionals often means neurologists will be on the front line dealing with suspected or confirmed neurogenetic conditions. The growing availability of broad genetic testing through chromosomal microarray and next-generation sequencing and the expanded phenotypic spectrum of many conditions has implications for genetic counseling and medical management. This article discusses the various forms of genetic variability and how to test for each of them. It also provides an update on the most common forms of neurologic presentations of genetic disease and a review of testing strategies.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The past several years have seen a dramatic increase in the ability to test for many inherited and autoimmune neuromuscular disorders more reliably and accurately. Similarly, numerous targeted therapies have been recently approved to treat previously untreatable disorders. Therefore, timely and accurate diagnosis is essential so that patients can receive appropriate therapy, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Muscle weakness is a common symptom resulting from dysfunction that can occur at any level of the neuraxis and is a cardinal feature of many neuromuscular disorders. An accurate and meticulous history and a thorough neurologic examination are paramount in localizing the lesion in order to generate a differential diagnosis and guide appropriate ancillary testing. The patient's age at symptom onset, any identified inciting factors, tempo of symptom progression, pattern of weakness, and associated symptoms and signs are all important diagnostic clues in the evaluation of a patient presenting with muscle weakness.},

  abstract = {This article considers the role of measurement validity within physical therapy research. The concept of measurement validity is identified as a component of internal validity, and it is differentiated from the notion of reliability; these concepts are related to systematic and random sources of error, respectively. Using examples from physical therapy and rehabilitation, four main types of validity are reviewed: face validity, criterion-related validity, content validity, and construct validity. The differing implications of these types of validity for quantitative and qualitative research are discussed. Three principal areas of concern are then addressed, based on a critical discussion of selected examples from the literature. First, it is argued that validity is often poorly distinguished from the allied concept of reliability and that purported claims for validity often only demonstrate reliability. Second, it is claimed that validity is too often neglected in favor of reliability, and specific examples relating to gait analysis are put forward to support this argument. Third, some of the methodological difficulties that may occur when attempts are made to demonstrate validity are considered. The article concludes with a plea for a closer focus on the issue of measurement validity within physical therapy research.},

Rehabilitation aims to regain symmetrical knee strength and function to minimize the risk of a second ACL injury after RTS. PURPOSE: To determine the effect of absolute quadriceps and hamstring strength, normalized by body weight, on the risk of a second ACL injury during the first 2 years after RTS in patients who have undergone ACL reconstruction (ACLR). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data from patients after index ACLR at the time of RTS were extracted from a rehabilitation registry-Project ACL. Patients who had performed isokinetic tests for quadriceps and hamstring strength and hop tests before RTS were included. The endpoint was a second ACL injury or a follow-up of 2 years after RTS after ACLR. RESULTS: A total of 835 patients (46\% women), with a mean age of 23.9 {\textpm} 7.7 years, were included. During the study period, 69 (8.3\%) second ACL injuries (ipsilateral and contralateral) occurred. Greater relative quadriceps strength in the injured leg increased the risk of a second ACL injury (relative risk [RR], 1.69 [95\% CI, 1.05-2.74]; P = .032). In patients who had recovered symmetrical quadriceps strength (limb symmetry index {$\geq$}90\%), there was no effect of quadriceps strength on the risk of second ACL injury (RR, 1.33 [95\% CI, 0.69-2.56]; P = .39). Quadriceps strength on the healthy side or hamstring strength, regardless of side, had no effect on the risk of a second ACL injury. CONCLUSION: Greater relative quadriceps strength in the injured leg at the time of RTS after ACLR was associated with an increased risk of a second ACL injury. There was no effect of relative quadriceps strength on the risk of a second ACL injury in patients who had recovered symmetrical quadriceps strength.},

Once health professionals and others realize that grounding is especially important in preventing inflammatory illness, an incredible effect on public health will be realized. The breath of validation from previous published data and real-life testimonials is a testimony of the earth's dramatic impact on healing the human body. Health information is constantly changing as a result of new research in various approaches to treating a multitude of inflammatory conditions. Sometimes, even with the most relevant published data, it is difficult to choose which advice is most conducive for healing. For example, it has been noted that perhaps one-third of the medical literature could be fraudulent.. Understanding absolute versus relative risk can also be confusing even for health professionals. And when data is reported in relative risk, only a fraction of the real science is revealed. However, one small established fact that conveys universal agreement is the simple correlation that inflammation is the root cause of almost all diseases!},

It is hoped that a greater understanding of each of these components will provide clinicians with the necessary information to deliver thoughtful and optimal care to affected individuals.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent advances include the finding that Tourette syndrome is likely due to a combination of several different genes, both low-effect and larger-effect variants, plus environmental factors. Pathophysiologically, increasing evidence supports involvement of the cortical--basal ganglia--thalamocortical circuit; however, the primary location and neurotransmitter remain controversial. Behavioral therapy is first-line treatment, and pharmacotherapy is based on tic severity. Several newer therapeutic agents are under investigation (eg, valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, cannabinoids), and deep brain stimulation is a promising therapy.                                         SUMMARY               Tics, defined as sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations, are essential components of Tourette syndrome. Although some tics may be mild, others can cause significant psychosocial, physical, and functional difficulties that affect daily activities. In addition to tics, most affected individuals have coexisting neuropsychological difficulties (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, mood disorder, disruptive behaviors, schizotypal traits, suicidal behavior, personality disorder, antisocial activities, and sleep disorders) that can further impact social and academic activities or employment.},

RECENT FINDINGS               PRES and RCVS are descriptive terms, each bringing together conditions with similar clinical-imaging manifestations. Headache, visual symptoms, seizures, and confusion occur in both syndromes. RCVS is usually heralded by recurrent thunderclap headaches, whereas encephalopathy and seizures are typical in PRES. In PRES, brain imaging shows reversible vasogenic edema that is typically symmetric and located in subcortical regions (mostly posterior predominant). In RCVS, brain imaging is often normal; cerebral angiography shows segmental vasoconstriction-vasodilatation affecting the circle of Willis arteries and their branches. Aside from shared clinical features, significant imaging overlap exists. Both PRES and RCVS can be complicated by ischemic and hemorrhagic brain lesions; angiographic abnormalities frequently occur in PRES and vasogenic edematous lesions in RCVS. Common triggers (eg, eclampsia, vasoconstrictive and chemotherapeutic agents) have been identified. Abnormal cerebrovascular tone and endothelial dysfunction may explain both syndromes. Management of these syndromes includes the removal of identified triggers, symptomatic treatment of headache or seizures, and moderate blood pressure control. Both syndromes are self-limited, with clinical recovery occurring within days to weeks. Long-term deficits and mortality are uncommon.                                         SUMMARY               PRES and RCVS have been well characterized and acknowledged to have significant overlap. Advances in our understanding of pathophysiology and risk factors for poor outcome are expected to optimize the management of these not uncommon syndromes.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common movement disorder associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Mutations in the PD-associated gene PARK7 alter the structure and function of the encoded protein DJ-1, and the resulting autosomal recessively inherited disease increases the risk of developing PD. DJ-1 was first discovered in 1997 as an oncogene and was associated with early-onset PD in 2003. Mutations in DJ-1 account for approximately 1\% of all recessively inherited early-onset PD occurrences, and the functions of the protein have been studied extensively. In healthy subjects, DJ-1 acts as an antioxidant and oxidative stress sensor in several neuroprotective mechanisms. It is also involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, regulation of apoptosis, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and dopamine homeostasis by regulating various signaling pathways, transcription factors, and molecular chaperone functions. While DJ-1 protects neurons against damaging reactive oxygen species, neurotoxins, and mutant {$\alpha$}-synuclein, mutations in the protein may lead to inefficient neuroprotection and the progression of PD. As current therapies treat only the symptoms of PD, the development of therapies that directly inhibit oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death is critical. DJ-1 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target, while oxidized DJ-1 could operate as a biomarker for PD. In this paper, we review the role of DJ-1 in the pathogenesis of PD by highlighting some of its key neuroprotective functions and the consequences of its dysfunction.},

We further show that exercise and regular physical activity decreases excitability and improves inhibition in both the central nervous system (brainstem inhibitory/facilitatory sites) and the immune system.

RECENT FINDINGS               Cough-induced headache requires neuroimaging to exclude posterior fossa pathology and recently has been reported as a common symptom in patients with CSF-venous fistula. Clinical overlap is observed between patients with primary exercise headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity. Patients with recurrent thunderclap headache associated with sexual activity should be presumed to have reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome until proven otherwise. De novo external-pressure headache is a common sequela among health care workers using personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily persistent headache is an important mimicker of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache and is distinguished by a daily-from-onset progression of persistent headache; a treatment-refractory course is often observed, and early involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including a psychotherapist, is advised.

  abstract = {Sever disease, or calcaneal apophysitis, is a common cause of heel pain in children or young athletes aged 8 to 15 with immature skeletons. Sever disease results from repetitive microtrauma to the secondary ossification center by traction of the Achilles tendon insertion on the calcaneus.~The condition frequently coincides with triceps surae shortening, which stems from the difference in growth rates between bone and muscle. Sever disease is common among children and adolescents who engage in sports that involve running and jumping. The pain occurs due to a sudden increase in sports activities, especially during a rapid growth spurt. However, the pain subsides with rest or when the activity is stopped.~Sever disease may also develop in less active adolescents who wear flat shoes. Patients affected by Sever disease usually report pain resolution during periods of rest or when the growth plate fully closes. Clinical examination demonstrates tenderness over the calcaneal insertion point of the Achilles tendon and a positive squeeze test involving manual medial and lateral compression of the posterior calcaneus.~The diagnosis of Sever disease is primarily clinical and does not necessitate imaging studies. However, plain radiographs can assist in ruling out bone fractures, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is valuable in differentiating Sever disease from infections and tumors.~ Sever disease typically follows a self-limited course, and its management involves activity modification or relative rest in response to pain. Symptom control incorporates the use of anti-inflammatory medications, ice, heel cups or heel lifts, and, in severe instances, immobilization.~A~rehabilitation regimen emphasizing heel cord stretching and strengthening should be integrated into the care plan to alleviate symptoms and address underlying biomechanical factors that may predispose the individual to the condition.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to answer the question: Does the contact of the human organism with the Earth via a copper conductor affect physiologic processes? Subjects and experiments: Five (5) experiments are presented: experiment 1-effect of earthing on calcium-phosphate homeostasis and serum concentrations of iron (N\,=\,84 participants); experiment 2-effect of earthing on serum concentrations of electrolytes (N\,=\,28); experiment 3-effect of earthing on thyroid function (N\,=\,12); experiment 4-effect of earthing on glucose concentration (N\,=\,12); experiment 5-effect of earthing on immune response to vaccine (N\,=\,32). Subjects were divided into two groups. One (1) group of people was earthed, while the second group remained without contact with the Earth. Blood and urine samples were examined. RESULTS: Earthing of an electrically insulated human organism during night rest causes lowering of serum concentrations of iron, ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus, and reduction of renal excretion of calcium and phosphorus. Earthing during night rest decreases free tri-iodothyronine and increases free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. The continuous earthing of the human body decreases blood glucose in patients with diabetes. Earthing decreases sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron, total protein, and albumin concentrations while the levels of transferrin, ferritin, and globulins {$\alpha$}1, {$\alpha$}2, {$\beta$}, and {$\gamma$} increase. These results are statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Earthing the human body influences human physiologic processes. This influence is observed during night relaxation and during physical activity. Effect of the earthing on calcium-phosphate homeostasis is the opposite of that which occurs in states of weightlessness. It also increases the activity of catabolic processes. It may be the primary factor regulating endocrine and nervous systems.},

  abstract = {Neuromodulation is a process of inhibition, stimulation, modification and regulation or therapeutic alteration of activity, electrically and chemically in the peripheral, central or autonomic nervous systems. Direct electric current or electric field alternates the function of nervous system. Coupling the human organism with the Earth directly or via a wire conductor changes the electric potential not only on the surface of the body but also inside it, changing the potential of electric environment of the human organism. Earthing refers to a direct contact with the Earth with bare feet or contact with the Earth with the use of conductive wire attached to the human body during sleeping, or daily activities. During earthing this electric potential equals to electric potential of the Earth and the value of it depends on location, time, atmospheric conditions, moisture of the surface of the Earth. The earthing which changes the density of negative charge in electric environment of the human body influences physiological processes. Our medical hypothesis states that contact with the Earth (earthing) directly or via a conductive wire plays role as a neuromodulative factor, probably primary, which enables the nervous system to be better adapted to the demands of organism and ambient environment. It helps to restore natural, electrical status of the electrical environment of the organism and thus the nervous system. Earthing generates immediate changes in electroencephalography (EEG), surface electromyography (SEMG), and somato-sensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). We hypothesize that earthing through its complex action on bioelectrical environment of human organism and alternations in electrolyte concentrations regulates correct functioning of the nervous system. Earthing significantly influences on the electrical activity of the brain.},

  abstract = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is the pathological basis of disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and other related diseases, and the lower back pain it produces lays a heavy financial burden on individuals and society. Thus, it is essential to comprehend IVDD's pathophysiology. Numerous factors, such as inflammatory factors, oxidative stress, apoptosis, matrix metalloproteinases, are linked to IVDD pathogenesis. Despite the fact that many researches has provided explanations for the pathophysiology of IVDD, these studies are typically singular, restricted, and isolated, expound only on one or two components, and do not systematically analyze and summarize the numerous influencing elements. In addition, we discovered that the incidence of many chronic diseases in the field of orthopedics may be thoroughly and systematically defined in terms of immunological systems. In order to provide a theoretical foundation for an in-depth understanding of the pathological process of IVDD and the formulation of more effective prevention and treatment measures, this review provides a comprehensive and systematic account of the pathogenesis of IVDD from the physical to the molecular barriers of the intervertebral disc, from the nucleus pulposus tissue to the cellular to the immune-molecular level.},

  abstract = {The myotome of a muscle is the basis for diagnosing spinal and peripheral nerve disorders. Despite its critical importance in clinical neurology, myotome charts presented in many textbooks, surprisingly, show non-negligible discordances with each other. Many authors do not even clearly state the bases of their charts. Studies that have presented with raw data regarding myotome identification are rather rare. A classic study in the 19th century that pursued the nerve course in cadavers still has a substantial influence on existing charts, despite its definite limitations. Other scarce studies in humans include identification by root stimulation during surgery, clinical observations in root avulsion or spinal cord injury and clinical and electromyographical investigations in patients with single radiculopathies or certain plexopathies. A few recent studies have proposed new theories regarding the myotomes of some muscles. T1 innervation of the median intrinsic hand muscles is a typical example. We have added a number of new findings, such as T1 innervation of the forearm flexor muscles innervated by the median nerve except the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis, C5 innervation of the brachioradialis, and two C6 indicator muscles, pronator teres and extensor carpi radialis brevis. Increased accuracy of the myotome charts will improve the localisation in neurology.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Growing evidence supports healthy nutrition, exercise, and emotional well-being (wellness) as foundational for MS symptom management. A stepped approach starts with healthy lifestyle practices and adds nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and procedural-based therapies balancing levels of evidence, risks, and potential benefits. The growing availability of cannabis and widespread use of dietary supplements in self-management of MS symptoms raise both therapeutic promises and challenges.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the effectiveness of two home-based exercise programs for treating multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI) in patients diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders (HSD). METHODS: Twenty-one hEDS/HSD patients with MDI were recruited from the Center for Medical Genetics of the Ghent University Hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group. Both groups received a 6-month home-based exercise program. The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario Shoulder Index (WOSI). Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), Global Rating of Change (GROC), and pain pressure thresholds. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 6\,weeks, 12\,weeks, and 24\,weeks. RESULTS: Significant main effects for time were observed for all questionnaires, except for the TSK (p\,=\,0.12). Patients improved 240 and 325 points on the WOSI after 12 (p\,=\,0.02) and 24\,weeks (p\,=\,0.001), respectively. Additionally, patients improved 8.6 points on the DASH (p\,=\,0.002), 4.3 points on the PSFS (p\,=\,0.01), and 1.02 points on the GROC (p\,=\,0.001) after 24\,weeks. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found between group A and B. Both home-based exercise programs led to significant improvements in shoulder function. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONHome-based exercise therapy may be effective for treating MDI in the hEDS/HSD population.Home-based training is beneficial for improving shoulder function, but a multidisciplinary, supervised approach might be more effective for altering kinesiophobia in this patient population.},

RECENT FINDINGS               A new approach to classifying dystonia has been created with the aim to increase the recognition and diagnosis of dystonia.

SUMMARY               Dystonia is a common movement disorder involving abnormal, often twisting, postures and is a challenging condition to diagnose. The pathophysiology of dystonia involves abnormalities in brain motor networks in the context of genetic factors. Dystonia has genetic, idiopathic, and acquired forms, with a wide phenotypic spectrum, and is a common feature in complex neurologic disorders. Dystonia can be isolated or combined with another movement disorder and may be focal, segmental, multifocal, or generalized in distribution, with some forms only occurring during the performance of specific tasks (task-specific dystonia). Dystonia is classified by clinical characteristics and presumed etiology. The management of dystonia involves accurate diagnosis, followed by treatment with botulinum toxin injections, oral medications, and surgical therapies (mainly deep brain stimulation), as well as pathogenesis-directed treatments, including the prospect of disease-modifying or gene therapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most often diagnosed degenerative pathologies within the lumbar spine. Paraspinal muscle involvement could be a possible mediator in the pathophysiology of disc herniation and influences the course of pain and disability after both surgical or nonsurgical treatment. To potentially improve treatment, it may be important to assess multifidus muscle morphology in patients diagnosed with a LDH. OBJECTIVE: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis regarding the multifidus morphology in patients diagnosed with a LDH was conducted to assess the differences in multifidus muscle morphology between persons with LDH and healthy controls, and between the involved and the uninvolved side within subjects experiencing unilateral LDH. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted of articles published up to and including November 2019 using the Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and MEDLINE Ovid search engines. The articles obtained from this search were screened based on title and abstract using the predetermined eligibility criteria. Included full text articles were assessed for their methodologic quality using the modified Downs and Black checklist. Heterogeneous data regarding multifidus muscle morphology was included in the descriptive analysis; data that was homogenous was included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 3,176 articles. Based on the screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, 18 articles were included. Studies were either cross sectional or case-control studies assessing side-to-side differences or comparing patients diagnosed with a LDH to a healthy control group. Nine studies investigated whole muscle atrophy, six looked at muscle fat infiltration, seven studies assessed microscopic muscle properties including muscle fiber size, distribution, and muscle fibrosis. From the 18 articles, 10 were included in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, a comparison was made between side-to-side differences for muscle fiber size, distribution, and whole muscle size. Descriptive analysis showed increased fat infiltration and atrophy (muscle and individual fiber) of the multifidus muscle when comparing side-to-side differences or comparing cases to controls. Meta-analysis showed a significant decrease in type I and II muscle fiber size (p=.002, .01, respectively) combined with a significant increase in the number of type I muscle fibers (p=.008) at the side of LDH. Regarding whole muscle size, no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the presence of ipsilateral multifidus muscle changes in persons with unilateral LDH.},

The phenomenology of chorea is described in addition to other common hyperkinetic movements that may be mistaken for or coexist with chorea. Chorea can be acquired or hereditary. Key historical and clinical features that can aid in determining the etiology are reviewed, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment strategies are discussed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Clinical investigations are under way to target transcription and translation of the mutant huntingtin protein as a potential disease-modifying strategy in Huntington disease (HD). Additional heritable factors have been revealed through genome-wide association studies. Symptom-focused treatments for HD are are being studied, including a third vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor for chorea attenuation and drugs to target irritability and cognitive impairment. Increased availability of genetic testing has led to increased awareness of HD mimics (eg,                 C9orf72                 and IgLON5).                                                        SUMMARY               Chorea is a relatively common hyperkinetic disorder with a broad differential. The first step in the approach to a patient with chorea is accurately defining the phenomenology. Once it has been determined that the patient has chorea, the investigation into determining an etiology can begin. Factors such as age of onset, time course, family history, unique clinical features, and imaging and laboratory findings can guide the diagnosis. Treatments for most causes of chorea are purely symptomatic, although it is important to recognize causes that are reversible or have disease-modifying interventions.},

Studies regarding exercise and cardiovascular fitness, angiogenesis, neuroinflammation in relation to IGF-1 signalling, regulation of neurotrophins, neurogenesis and plasticity, cognitive training, are briefly described. We propose that current evidence points towards a mechanism by which cardiovascular fitness improvements act to promote long-term angiogenesis and cerebral circulation. This important adaptation allows for increased delivery and upregulation of neurotrophins along with supporting factors to the brain, particularly to the hippocampal neurogenic niche, following acute exercise bouts. We propose a sequential timeline and approximate time scale for this mechanism, describing how these stages generate increased support for neurogenesis and brain plasticity in combination with cognitive training to provide long-term cognitive benefits and protection against age-related cognitive decline. Influences from age, gender and other variables are considered, and methodological factors that could be utilised in future studies to further clarify the proposed model are discussed.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The exact pathophysiologic basis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy remains somewhat elusive. Diffusion-tensor imaging has emerged as a useful imaging modality that correlates more closely with clinical severity than standard MRI. Baseline disease severity, symptom duration, age, presence of impaired gait, and smoking status are significant factors related to surgical outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS               The manufacture, distribution, and use of so-called designer drugs are increasing. These agents can induce dramatic neurologic manifestations and can evade identification on conventional drug-screening assays. Additionally, gabapentinoids, drug agents that are very familiar to neurologists, are being abused in the general population at increasing rates to achieve euphoric highs and potentiate the effects of opiates. Furthermore, even well-known illicit narcotics such as heroin are posing dangers above their baseline because of ``lacing'' with additives or substitutes such as fentanyl and related compounds. These clandestine agents increase the potency of what are thought to be typical dosages to lethal levels, thus leading to more unintentional overdose deaths.                                         SUMMARY               The potential for short- and long-term nervous system injury from drug abuse is well established. However, it is important for the practicing neurologist to possess awareness of the features and observed sequelae of the toxidromes of both traditional and nontraditional drugs of abuse. This is because the use of both is widespread in our society and conventional drug screening can miss detection of some powerful agents, thus forcing us to maintain a high index of suspicion based on recognition of the clinical features.},

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and similar derivatives have exploded in prevalence, becoming the leading cause of overdose fatalities. The higher potency of synthetic opioids compared with semisynthetic and nonsynthetic opiates poses an increased risk for unintentional overdose when found as an adulterant in other illicit drug supplies such as heroin. Conversely, misinformation about the risk of symptomatic exposure to fentanyl through casual contact with the skin and ambient air has led to misdirected fear and stigma that threatens to impede valid harm-reduction measures for fentanyl users at risk of actual overdose. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose rates and deaths continued to climb, especially among those who use opioids and methamphetamine.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               A variety of potential neurologic effects and injuries can occur with illicit drug use owing to the diverse properties and mechanisms of action of the various classes. Many high-risk agents are not detected on standard drug screens, including so-called designer drugs, and the practicing neurologist is best served by recognizing the clinical features of the traditional toxidrome and other potential idiosyncratic effects of various illicit agents.},

  abstract = {Patients with complex regional pain syndrome suffer from chronic neuropathic pain and also show a decrease in sensorimotor performance associated with characteristic central and peripheral neural system parameters. In the brain imaging domain, these comprise altered functional sensorimotor representation for the affected hand side. With regard to neurophysiology, a decrease in intracortical inhibition for the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the affected hand has been repetitively verified, which might be related to increased primary somatosensory cortex functional activation for the affected limb. Rare longitudinal intervention studies in randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that a decrease in primary somatosensory cortex functional MRI activation coincided with pain relief and recovery in sensorimotor performance. By applying a randomized wait-list control crossover study design, we tested possible associations of clinical, imaging and neurophysiology parameters in 21 patients with complex regional pain syndrome in the chronic stage ({$>$}6 months). In more detail, we applied graded motor imagery over 6 weeks to relieve movement pain of the affected upper limb. First, baseline parameters were tested between the affected and the non-affected upper limb side and age-matched healthy controls. Second, longitudinal changes in clinical and testing parameters were associated with neurophysiological and imaging parameters. During baseline short intracortical inhibition, as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation, was decreased only for hand muscles of the affected hand side. During movement of the affected limb, primary somatosensory cortex functional MRI activation was increased. Hand representation area size for somatosensory stimulation in functional MRI was smaller on the affected side with longer disease duration. Graded motor imagery intervention but not waiting, resulted in a decrease of movement pain. An increase of somatosensory hand representation size over graded motor imagery intervention was related to movement pain relief. Over graded motor imagery intervention, pathological parameters like the increased primary somatosensory cortex activation during fist movement or decreased short intracortical inhibition were modified in the same way as movement pain and hand performance improved. No such changes were observed during the waiting period. Overall, we demonstrated characteristic changes in clinical, behaviour and neuropathology parameters applying graded motor imagery in patients with upper limb complex regional pain syndrome, which casts light on the effects of graded motor imagery intervention on biomarkers for chronic neuropathic pain.},

This article reviews common inherited nervous system tumor syndromes including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The epidemiology, genetics, approach to diagnosis, neurologic and nonneurologic manifestations, and management options are reviewed.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Awareness of the more common and clinically relevant familial nervous system tumor syndromes is important. These conditions teach us about the underlying biology that drives tumor development in the central and peripheral nervous systems including peripheral nerve sheath tumors (eg, neurofibroma, schwannoma), meningioma, vestibular schwannoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, and hemangioblastoma. Knowledge of the clinical manifestations ensures that the neurologist will be able to diagnose these conditions, recommend appropriate surveillance, refer to specialists, and support optimal management. Important discoveries in the role of the underlying genetics have contributed to the launch of several novel drug trials for these tumors, which are changing therapeutic options for patients.                                         SUMMARY               Familial nervous system tumor syndromes are uncommon conditions that require specialized surveillance and management strategies. Coordination across a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, neuro-oncologists, radiologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, otolaryngologists, pathologists, neuropsychologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists, and geneticists is necessary for the optimal treatment of these patients.},

Although head injuries are frequently documented in the surfing population, an in depth assessment of the prevalence of surfing-related head injury has not been reported. A web-based survey was conducted in May of 2015. Participants were asked a series of questions regarding surfing-related injuries and demographic characteristics. A total of 50 responses were obtained, of which 35 (70\%) reported sustaining a head injury. The most common injury was laceration of the head/face (n=27), followed by concussion (n=13). Other injuries, such as skull fracture and broken nose, were also reported. Only 2 of the 50 participants reported wearing a protective helmet. Neurosurgical intervention was required in 2 instances. Increased emphasis on preventative measures by the medical community may reduce the future incidence of such injuries.

RECENT FINDINGS               The guidelines for acute and preventive treatment of migraine were updated in 2019. These guidelines summarize the available evidence and outline the questions that should be addressed in future research. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of several new classes of drugs and devices to treat adult migraine in the past few years has resulted in ongoing or planned pediatric trials.                                         SUMMARY               Headache is a common symptom in children, and it is important to take a detailed history and perform a thorough physical examination to make the diagnosis. Nearly 1 in 10 children experience recurrent headaches due to migraine, which cause significant impairment in school performance and quality of life. The acute and preventive treatments that are currently available will help at least two-thirds of children with migraine, and several trials of new therapies offer hope for the future.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Laboratory and imaging biomarkers are being developed for accurate diagnosis of neurobehavioral disorders, yet few are currently available for clinical use. Moreover, not all centers have access to these potential tools. Practicing clinicians are therefore left primarily with their skills of history taking and examination. Although geared for research, diagnostic criteria have been refined over the past several years and can nevertheless aid the clinician with the diagnosis of disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, the primary progressive aphasias, corticobasal syndrome, vascular cognitive impairment, and posterior cortical atrophy. Regularly revised criteria reflect ongoing knowledge gained from in-depth studies of these disorders.

Although some drugs and hormones can affect metabolism in skeletal muscle, this review will focus on the genetic metabolic myopathies.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Impairments in glycogenolysis/glycolysis (glycogen storage disease), fatty acid transport/oxidation (fatty acid oxidation defects), and mitochondrial metabolism (mitochondrial myopathies) represent most metabolic myopathies; however, they often overlap clinically with structural genetic myopathies, referred to as pseudometabolic myopathies. Although metabolic myopathies can present in the neonatal period with hypotonia, hypoglycemia, and encephalopathy, most cases present clinically in children or young adults with exercise intolerance, rhabdomyolysis, and weakness. In general, the glycogen storage diseases manifest during brief bouts of high-intensity exercise; in contrast, fatty acid oxidation defects and mitochondrial myopathies usually manifest during longer-duration endurance-type activities, often with fasting or other metabolic stressors (eg, surgery, fever). The neurologic examination is often normal between events (except in the pseudometabolic myopathies) and evaluation requires one or more of the following tests: exercise stress testing, blood (eg, creatine kinase, acylcarnitine profile, lactate, amino acids), urine (eg, organic acids, myoglobin), muscle biopsy (eg, histology, ultrastructure, enzyme testing), and targeted (specific gene) or untargeted (myopathy panels) genetic tests.                                         SUMMARY               Definitive identification of a specific metabolic myopathy often leads to specific interventions, including lifestyle, exercise, and nutritional modifications; cofactor treatments; accurate genetic counseling; avoidance of specific triggers; and rapid treatment of rhabdomyolysis.},

Following a two-phase evaluation, eight SRMs were selected for final review with the Qualiveen and Short-Form (SF) Qualiveen and the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score (NBDS) being recommended as supplemental, highly-recommended due to their strong psychometrics and extensive use in SCI/D. Two datasets and other SRM measures were recommended as supplemental.Conclusion: There is no one single measure that can be used to assess NBB dysfunction across all clinical research studies. Clinical and diagnostic tools are here recommended based on specific medical needs of the person with SCI/D. Following the CDE for SCI studies guidelines, we recommend both the SF-Qualiveen for bladder and the NBDS for bowel as relatively short measures with strong psychometrics. Other measures are also recommended. A combination of assessment tools (objective and subjective) to be used jointly across the spectrum of care seems critical to best capture changes related to NBB and develop better treatments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE               The objective of this study was to determine the demographics and predictors of postconcussion syndrome (PCS) in a large series of patients using a novel definition of PCS.                                         METHODS               The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 284 consecutive concussed patients, 221 of whom had PCS on the basis of at least 3 symptoms persisting at least 1 month. This definition of PCS was uniformly employed and is unique in accepting an expanded list of symptoms, in shortening the postconcussion interval to 1 month from 3 months, and in excluding those with focal injuries such as hemorrhages and contusions.                                         RESULTS                                The 221 cases showed considerable heterogeneity in clinical features of PCS. They averaged 3.3 concussions, with a range of 0 to 12 or more concussions, and 62.4\% occurred during sports and recreation. The median duration of PCS was 7 months at the time of examination, with 11.8\% lasting more than 2 years, and 23.1\% with PCS had only 1 concussion. The average patient age was 27 years (range 10--74 years). The average number of persistent symptoms was 8.1; 26.2\% had a previous psychiatric condition, attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a learning disability, or previous migraine headaches. The prevalence of arachnoid cysts and Chiari malformation in PCS exceeded the general population. Additionally, involvement in litigation, presence of extracranial injuries, amnesia and/or loss of consciousness, and female sex were predictive of reporting a high number of symptoms. A prior history of psychiatric conditions or migraines, cause of injury, number of previous concussions, and age did not significantly predict symptom number. Only the number of symptoms reported predicted the duration of PCS. To predict the number of symptoms for those who fulfilled PCS criteria according to the                 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision                 (ICD-10), and the                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition                 (DSM-IV), the number of previous concussions was significant.                                                        CONCLUSIONS               PCS is commonly associated with multiple concussions, but 23.1\% in the present series occurred after only 1 concussion. Most patients with PCS had multiple symptoms persisting for months or years. The median duration of PCS was 7 months, with a range up to 26 years. In only 11.3\%, the PCS had ended at the time of consultation. Not all predictors commonly cited in the literature align with the findings in this study. This is likely due to differences in the definitions of PCS used in research. These results suggest that the use of ICD-10 and DSM-IV to diagnose PCS may be biased toward those who are vulnerable to concussions or with more severe forms of PCS. It is thus important to redefine PCS based on evidence-based medicine.},

Recent Findings:               As most cases of acute low back pain have a favorable prognosis, current guidelines on imaging studies recommend conservative treatment for 6 weeks prior to obtaining an MRI if no red flags are present. Of these red flags, a prior history of cancer is the strongest risk factor for a malignant etiology and requires urgent evaluation with MRI. Management of acute low back pain is mainly conservative with oral non-narcotic analgesics and mobilization as the initial recommendations. For patients with radiculopathy, epidural steroids may result in short-term pain relief, but long-term effects are still unclear.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Eliciting tenderness in the region of the ulnar fovea is a possibly useful clinical test for defining the source of ulnar-sided wrist pain. Until now, no reports of the clinical sensitivity and specificity of this test have been available. Based on anecdotal observations, a hypothesis was developed stating that ulnar fovea tenderness (positive "ulnar fovea sign") is sensitive and specific in detecting two ulnar-sided wrist conditions: foveal disruption of the distal radioulnar ligaments and ulnotriquetral (UT) ligament injuries. METHODS: The clinical records of 272 consecutive patients with wrist arthroscopy performed by the senior author from 1998 through to 2005 were reviewed. Relevant clinical and surgical data were abstracted. The ulnar fovea sign test is executed by pressing the examiner's thumb distally into the interval between the ulnar styloid process and flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, between the volar surface of the ulnar head and the pisiform. A positive ulnar fovea sign is designated when there is exquisite tenderness that the patient claims replicates their pain, with comparisons made with the contralateral side. RESULTS: There were a total of 90 foveal disruptions and 68 UT ligament injuries diagnosed during wrist arthroscopy. The ulnar fovea sign was positive in 156 patients. The sensitivity of the fovea sign in detecting foveal disruptions and/or UT ligament injuries was 95.2\%. Its specificity was 86.5\%. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis stating that the ulnar fovea sign is a useful clinical maneuver to detect foveal disruptions and UT ligament tears is supported. The conditions represent 2 common sources of ulnar-sided wrist pain. The differentiation between the 2 conditions may be made clinically, where UT ligament tears are typically associated with a stable distal radioulnar joint and foveal disruptions are typically associated with an unstable distal radioulnar joint.

  abstract = {Several intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) are available to assess the interrater reliability (IRR) of observational measurements. Selecting an ICC is complicated, and existing guidelines have three major limitations. First, they do not discuss incomplete designs, in which raters partially vary across subjects. Second, they provide no coherent perspective on the error variance in an ICC, clouding the choice between the available coefficients. Third, the distinction between fixed or random raters is often misunderstood. Based on generalizability theory (GT), we provide updated guidelines on selecting an ICC for IRR, which are applicable to both complete and incomplete observational designs. We challenge conventional wisdom about ICCs for IRR by claiming that raters should seldom (if ever) be considered fixed. Also, we clarify how to interpret ICCs in the case of unbalanced and incomplete designs. We explain four choices a researcher needs to make when selecting an ICC for IRR, and guide researchers through these choices by means of a flowchart, which we apply to three empirical examples from clinical and developmental domains. In the Discussion, we provide guidance in reporting, interpreting, and estimating ICCs, and propose future directions for research into the ICCs for IRR.

RECENT FINDINGS               Abnormal vascular loops compressing cranial nerves are the most common known pathogenesis associated with the primary neuralgias.                                         SUMMARY               The most frequently encountered primary neuralgias are trigeminal neuralgia, occipital neuralgia, and, rarely, glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Nervus intermedius neuralgia is even more rare. All neuralgias merit a careful workup for secondary causes. Drug treatment generally relies on antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA can be useful in treating some cranial neuralgias. Surgical and invasive treatments include ablation, gamma knife treatment, and microvascular decompression.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: The Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) is considered a simple quantification tool to assess static foot alignment. Palpation of the foot is required for assessment of one of the six criteria that comprise the FPI-6; the remaining five criteria may be evaluated using still-frame photographs. Using only the image-based criteria may allow multiple clinicians to evaluate large groups of patients quickly. Reliability using only these five image-based criteria has not been established. The purposes of the current study were to establish the inter- and intra-rater reliability using five image-based criteria from the Foot Posture Index-6 (FPI-6) as well as to examine the agreement between the raters in identifying foot type using the composite five FPI scores. METHODS: Forty participants (23 females, 17 males; 23.67 {\textpm} 8.49 years; 64.59 {\textpm} 14.43 kg; 166.07 {\textpm} 11.79 cm) volunteered for this study. An investigator took three photos with a digital camera of the medial longitudinal arch, posterior ankle, and of the talonavicular joint approximately 45{$^\circ$} from the posterior calcaneus for both right and left feet. Two investigators assessed the five image-based criteria of the FPI-6 for both feet of 40 participants on three occasions separated by a day. Inter-and intra-rater reliability were assessed with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC3,2). The amount of agreement for classification of foot posture type between the two raters was assessed with Cohen's kappa coefficient. Significance was set a priori at P {$<$} 0.05. RESULTS: The inter-rater reliability was poor to moderate for all three sessions (ICC3,2 = 0.334-0.634). For the foot posture classification, the amount of agreement between two raters was poor for left ({$\kappa$}= 0.12) and right ({$\kappa$}= 0.19) feet. The intra-rater reliability was excellent for left (ICC3,2=0.956) and right feet (ICC3,2=0.959). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent intra-rater and poor to moderate inter-rater reliability was found using only the five image-based criteria of the FPI-6. However, the classification of foot posture did not improve the amount of agreement between raters. Therefore, caution is needed when interpreting FPI scores from five image-based criteria.

The diagnostic approach, clinical features of important acquired and genetic choreas, and therapeutic principles are also discussed. Practical clinical points and caveats are included.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                C9orf72 disease is the most common Huntington disease phenocopy, according to studies in the European population. Anti-IgLON5 disease can present with chorea. The role of immunotherapies in Sydenham chorea has increased, and further clinical studies may be useful. Benign hereditary chorea is a syndrome or phenotype due to mutations in several genes, including                 NKX2-1                 ,                 ADCY5, GNAO1,                 and                 PDE10A                 . New-generation presynaptic dopamine-depleting agents provide more options for symptomatic treatment of chorea with fewer adverse effects. Deep brain stimulation has been performed in several choreic disorders, but features other than chorea and the neurodegenerative nature should be taken into consideration. Studies on genetic interventions for Huntington disease are ongoing.                                                        SUMMARY               Clinical features remain crucial in guiding the differential diagnosis and appropriate investigations in chorea. Given the complexity of most choreic disorders, treating only the chorea is not sufficient. A comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach is required.},

  abstract = {The role of the trigeminal system in facial and dural sensitivity has been recognized for a long time. More recently, the trigeminal system has also been considered a prominent actor in brain nociceptive innervation. It is the anatomical substrate of several frequent conditions, such as primary or secondary headaches, trigeminal neuralgia, and other orofacial pains. Appreciation of the delicate anatomical arrangement of the trigeminal pathway is one of the keys to understanding these conditions' pathophysiology and to proposing innovative treatments. This review provides a structured presentation of existing knowledge about the trigeminal system, from classical anatomical data to the most recent literature. First, we present the organization of the trigeminal pathway from the trigeminal divisions, nerve, and nuclei to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex. We describe the neurons and fibers' repartition at each level, depending on the location (somatotopic organization) and the type of receptors (modal organization). Such a dual somatotopic-modal arrangement of the trigeminal fibers is especially clear for the juxtapontine segment of the trigeminal nerve and the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem. It has significant clinical consequences both for diagnosis and treatment. Second, we explore how the trigeminal system is modulated and involved in reflexes, for instance the trigemino-cardiac and the trigemino-autonomic reflexes, which could play an essential role in the autonomic symptoms observed in cluster headache. Finally, we present how to interact with this complex system to relieve pain mediated by the trigeminal system. This section covers both neuromodulatory and lesional approaches.},

  abstract = {Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder involving~a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Progressive muscle weakness, most notably of the proximal lower limbs, is the primary manifestation of this condition.~The onset of BMD symptoms varies widely between 5 and 60 years. In a study involving 67 individuals with BMD, most were found ambulant until their 40s or older, while a small group experienced earlier loss of ambulation.~BMD symptoms usually~appear at a later age~than~a similar X-linked disorder, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD and BMD may be easier to distinguish based on~the age at which patients become wheelchair-dependent. Patients with DMD are wheelchair-dependent before age 13, while individuals with BMD may remain ambulatory even after age 16.~Patients presenting with proximal muscle weakness before turning 12 may be hard to diagnose without genetic analysis. BMD is currently considered a mild form of DMD rather than a distinct clinical entity. Consequently, interventional trials are more rarely conducted for BMD than DMD. Skeletal muscle fibers (myocytes) arise from the fusion of contiguous embryonic muscle cells and are thus multinucleated. Multiple nuclei may be found close to the intracytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane (sarcolemma). Myocytes have abundant microfilaments, which give rise to the contractile apparatus of the myofibrils. The repeating units of myofibrils are the sarcomeres, composed of interlaced actin and myosin filaments and perpendicularly oriented Z-bands.~The T-tubule system is a sarcolemmal invagination into the~myocyte involved in calcium storage and release during contraction. The sarcoplasm (myocyte cytoplasm) contains myoglobin, glycogen, creatine, creatine kinase (CK), lysosomes,~mitochondria, and lipid vacuoles.~ Actin binds to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeletal protein dystrophin,~which interfaces with~the extracellular matrix through transmembrane dystrophin-associated proteins. Dystrophin normally provides mechanical reinforcement, stabilizing the cell membrane.~Dystrophin abnormality is the leading cause of BMD.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Identification of the etiology of chronic meningitis remains challenging, with no cause identified in at least one-third of cases. Often, several serologic, CSF, and neuroimaging studies are indicated, although novel diagnostic platforms including metagenomic deep sequencing may hold promise for identifying organisms. Infectious etiologies are more common in those at risk for disseminated disease, specifically those who are immunocompromised because of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplantation, or immunosuppressant medications. An important step in identifying the etiology of chronic meningitis is assembling a multidisciplinary team of individuals, including those with specialized expertise in ophthalmology, dermatology, rheumatology, and infectious diseases, to provide guidance regarding diagnostic procedures.                                         SUMMARY               Chronic meningitis is defined as inflammation involving the meninges that lasts at least 4 weeks and is associated with a CSF pleocytosis. Chronic meningitis has numerous possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies, making it challenging to definitively diagnose patients. Therefore, a multifaceted approach that combines history, physical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory analysis, including novel diagnostic platforms, is needed. This article focuses on key aspects of the evaluation of and approach to patients with chronic meningitis. Specific infectious etiologies and differential diagnoses of subacute and chronic meningitis, including noninfectious etiologies, are addressed.},

Since diet may potentially affect OA, we reviewed the literature on the relationship between nutrition and OA risk or progression, aiming to provide guidance for clinicians. For overweight/obese patients, weight reduction, ideally incorporating exercise, is paramount. The association between metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes and OA risk or progression may partly explain the apparent benefit of dietary-lipid modification resulting from increased consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty-acids from oily fish/fish oil supplements. A strong association between OA and raised serum cholesterol together with clinical effects in statin users suggests a potential benefit of reduction of cholesterol by dietary means. Patients should ensure that they meet the recommended intakes for micronutrients such as vitamin K, which has a role in bone/cartilage mineralization.

The processing methods of the electronic dynamometer-derived signal may influence the outcome measures. This study determined the influence of filtering and sample rate (SR) on isometric torque-time parameters and provides specific signal processing recommendations for future studies. Twenty-three subjects performed 49 isometric maximum voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the knee extensors on an isokinetic dynamometer. Outcome measures included peak torque (PT), and rate of torque development at peak (RTDPEAK), 50 (RTD50) and 200\,(RTD200) ms for seven filter conditions including low-pass filter cutoffs at 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 150\,Hz and a notch filter at 100 and 200\,Hz. Comparisons were also made across four SR conditions at 100, 500, 1000 and 2000\,Hz. The RTDPEAK variable was markedly changed (-5.4 to -37.9\%) for all filter frequencies compared to the 150\,Hz condition and the RTD50 variable was altered for all frequencies between 50 and 5\,Hz. No differences were found for RTD200. For SR, compared to the 2000\,Hz condition, differences were revealed for the 100\,Hz condition for the RTDPEAK and RTD50 variables. The filtering or SR did not alter PT across any of the conditions. The filter and SR applied to the signal was capable of distorting the MVC signal and skewing the torque-time parameters, specifically for the early and maximum RTD variables of the MVC curve (RTD50 and RTDPEAK). For traditional isokinetic dynamometers, a low-pass filter cutoff of 150\,Hz and a SR of at least 1000\,Hz is recommended when assessing early isometric force- or torque-time MVC parameters.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate is an active ingredient of the most widely used herbicide and it is believed to be less toxic than other pesticides. However, several recent studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptor. This study focuses on the effects of pure glyphosate on estrogen receptors (ERs) mediated transcriptional activity and their expressions. Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer, T47D cells, but not in hormone-independent breast cancer, MDA-MB231 cells, at 10{$^{-12}$} to 10{$^{-6}$}M in estrogen withdrawal condition. The proliferative concentrations of glyphosate that induced the activation of estrogen response element (ERE) transcription activity were 5-13 fold of control in T47D-KBluc cells and this activation was inhibited by an estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, indicating that the estrogenic activity of glyphosate was mediated via ERs. Furthermore, glyphosate also altered both ER{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} expression. These results indicated that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate possessed estrogenic activity. Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used for soybean cultivation, and our results also found that there was an additive estrogenic effect between glyphosate and genistein, a phytoestrogen in soybeans. However, these additive effects of glyphosate contamination in soybeans need further animal study.},

This article reviews the diagnostic criteria, clinical features, neuroimaging findings, differential diagnosis, and management options for this condition.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent population studies have found that the annual incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is increasing in association with obesity rates, whereas recent scientific studies indicate a possible role for androgen sex hormones and adipose tissue in the pathogenesis of the disease. Prospective clinical trials have demonstrated a role for weight loss, acetazolamide, and topiramate in the management of mild disease. A recently begun randomized multicenter trial of surgical interventions will provide insight into the indications for surgical intervention, optimal timing and choice of intervention, and long-term outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder producing symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure in the absence of an alternative cause. The main goals of treatment are to preserve visual function and alleviate symptoms, which can usually be achieved with a combination of weight loss, medical therapies, and surgical interventions depending on the severity of symptoms and vision loss, response to treatment, and subsequent clinical course.},

Inadequate transition planning and execution can lead to gaps in care, unexpected emergency department visits, and an increase in health care costs and patient/caregiver anxiety. Many barriers that prevent adequate transition have been identified, including insufficient time or staff to provide transition services, inadequate reimbursement, resistance from patients and caregivers, and a dearth of accepting adult providers.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Transition is distinct from transfer of care. Transition is a planned multistage process, while transfer refers to a point in time where responsibility of care shifts from one provider to another. Key differences exist between the pediatric and adult models of care. A successful transition should empower the patient to understand and take responsibility in managing his or her condition; foster independent functioning to the extent that is possible; integrate educational, legal, and community resources in the care plan; and identify appropriate adult health care providers at the time of transfer. Different models have been proposed to streamline the transition process, with improvement in patients' knowledge of their condition, self-efficacy, and confidence.                                         SUMMARY               Neurologists have a key role in supporting their patients in the transition to adulthood. This article reviews basic tenets and provides tools to assist in navigating the complex transition process. These tenets are intended to improve quality of care and decrease clinician burden and remain an active area of research.},

Latest Developments               Although most have historically been classified as autoimmune disorders, rheumatologic diseases are increasingly conceptualized as distributed along a spectrum with various contributions of autoimmune (adaptive immune dysregulation) and autoinflammatory (innate immune dysregulation) mechanisms. Our evolving understanding of systemic immune-mediated disorders has been accompanied by an expansion in our differential diagnoses and therapeutic options.                                         Essential Points               Rheumatologic disease involves both autoimmune and autoinflammatory mechanisms. Neurologic symptoms can be the first manifestation of these disorders, and familiarity with the systemic manifestations of specific diseases is essential to establish the correct diagnosis. Conversely, knowledge of the neurologic syndromes that are most likely to be associated with specific systemic disorders can help narrow the differential and increase confidence when attributing a neuropsychiatric symptom to an underlying systemic disorder.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Close Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUES test) is a low cost shoulder functional test that could be considered as a complementary and objective clinical outcome for shoulder performance evaluation. However, its reliability was tested only in recreational athletes' males and there are no studies comparing scores between sedentary and active samples. The purpose was to examine inter and intrasession reliability of CKCUES Test for samples of sedentary male and female with (SIS), for samples of sedentary healthy male and female, and for male and female samples of healthy upper extremity sport specific recreational athletes. Other purpose was to compare scores within sedentary and within recreational athletes samples of same gender. METHODS: A sample of 108 subjects with and without SIS was recruited. Subjects were tested twice, seven days apart. Each subject performed four test repetitions, with 45 seconds of rest between them. The last three repetitions were averaged and used to statistical analysis. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ICC2,1 was used to assess intrasession reliability of number of touches score and ICC2,3 was used to assess intersession reliability of number of touches, normalized score, and power score. Test scores within groups of same gender also were compared. Measurement error was determined by calculating the Standard Error of the Measurement (SEM) and Minimum detectable change (MDC) for all scores. RESULTS: The CKCUES Test showed excellent intersession reliability for scores in all samples. Results also showed excellent intrasession reliability of number of touches for all samples. Scores were greater in active compared to sedentary, with exception of power score. All scores were greater in active compared to sedentary and SIS males and females. SEM ranged from 1.45 to 2.76 touches (based on a 95\% CI) and MDC ranged from 2.05 to 3.91(based on a 95\% CI) in subjects with and without SIS. At least three touches are needed to be considered a real improvement on CKCUES Test scores. CONCLUSION: Results suggest CKCUES Test is a reliable tool to evaluate upper extremity functional performance for sedentary, for upper extremity sport specific recreational, and for sedentary males and females with SIS.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The results of several large brain bank case series among subjects with a history of contact sports or repetitive head trauma have indicated that a high frequency of CTE may exist in this population. However, the true prevalence of CTE among individuals with a history of head trauma remains unknown, given that individuals who experienced cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms during life are more likely to have their brains donated for autopsy at death and epidemiologic studies of the condition are lacking. Neuropathologic consensus criteria have been published. Research-based clinical criteria have been proposed and are beginning to be applied, but the definitive diagnosis of CTE in a living patient remains impossible without effective biomarkers for the condition, which is an active area of study.

  abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a member of the pro-inflammatory cytokine family, induces the expression of a variety of proteins responsible for acute inflammation, and plays an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of cells in humans. IL-6 signaling is mediated by building a complex of IL-6, the transmembrane IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) or with soluble forms of IL-6R (sIL-6R), and the signal-transducing subunit molecule gp130. Therefore, three modes for IL-6 signaling may occur in which IL-6 is binding to mIL-6R (classic), to sIL-6R (trans-signaling), or is joined through IL-6R to gp130 on nearby located cells (trans-presentation). These pathways, and the fact that gp130 is ubiquitously expressed, lead to the pleiotropic functions of IL-6. The control of IL-6 signaling is regulated through the induction of suppressor molecules after activation of the IL-6 pathways as well as through the presence of sIL-6R and gp130 forms in the blood. Vice versa, an overproduction of IL-6 and dysregulation of the IL-6 signaling pathways can result in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders as well as cancer development suggesting that IL-6 plays a significant role in the human cytokine network. Several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for inhibiting the cytokine itself, the signaling via the IL-6 receptor, or target kinases (e.g., JAK/STAT) associated with the signaling pathways. Amongst others, tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R humanized antibody) has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cytokine release syndrome, and idiopathic multicentric Castleman's disease (iMCD), whereas siltuximab (an IL-6 antagonist) received approval for iMCD only. Although not all IL-6-associated diseases respond to IL-6 blockade, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the IL-6 pathways may, therefore, help to find the best treatment for IL-6-associated diseases in the near future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychological readiness to return to sports (RTS) has been associated with second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, this relationship is controversial because covariates such as anatomic and knee function characteristics have not been adequately considered. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: To investigate whether psychological readiness in the early postoperative period can predict the occurrence of a second ACL injury within 24 months after primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) using propensity score analysis. It was hypothesized that patients with high ACL-RSI after injury (ACL-RSI) scores at 3 months postoperatively would have a second ACL injury within the projected postoperative period. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Included were 169 patients who underwent primary ACLR using hamstring tendon autografts between November 2017 and July 2021 and also underwent knee functional assessments at 3 months postoperatively. The ACL-RSI scale was used to assess psychological readiness for RTS. A second ACL injury was defined if ipsilateral or contralateral ACL injury was confirmed by examination within 24 months postoperatively. Based on a previous study showing that 65 was the highest cutoff value for the ACL-RSI score for RTS, we classified patients into 2 groups: those with high ACL-RSI scores ({$\geq$}65; group H) and those with low ACL-RSI scores ({$<$}65; group L). We generated 1-to-1 matched pairs using propensity score analysis and used log-rank testing to compare the rate of second ACL injury between the 2 groups. RESULTS: More patients returned to any sports activities within 12 months in group H than in group L (90\% vs 73\%; P = .03). A second ACL injury within 24 months postoperatively was identified in 7\% of patients (13/169). The rate of second ACL injury was significantly higher in group H than in group L (17.6\% vs 3.4\%; P = .001). In 43 matched pairs extracted using propensity scoring, the rate of second ACL injury was also higher in group H than in group L (18.6\% vs 4.7\%; P = .04). CONCLUSION: Patients with a higher ACL-RSI score at 3 months exhibited a significantly higher incidence of second ACL injury within 24 months after primary ACLR.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the test-retest reliability of the 4-meter walk test (4 MWT) and 10-meter walk test (10 MWT) in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery during inpatient rehabilitation. METHOD: In all, 102 patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), lower extremity fracture (LEF) and soft tissue operation were recruited. Patients performed two 4 MWT and two 10 MWT trials on the same day. The same researcher performed all the measurements to avoid inter-rater variability. RESULTS: The 4 MWT and 10 MWT were shown to have excellent test-retest reliability. The ICCs for the 4 MWT and 10 MWT were found as 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. The SEMs for the 4 MWT and 10 MWT were 2.0 and 5.5\,seconds, respectively. The smallest real difference at the 95\% confidence level (SRD95) was 5.5\,seconds for the 4 MWT and 12.2\,seconds for 10 MWT and SRD95 percentage was 31.2 for the 4 MWT and 28.5 for the 10 MWT. CONCLUSION: Both the 4 MWT and the 10 MWT have excellent reliability in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery such as TKA, THA, LEF and soft tissue operation during inpatient rehabilitation. Clinicians and researchers can be confident that changes above the SRD95s for the different patient groups, for both sexes and with regard to weight-bearing status, represent a real clinical change in rehabilitation process. Implications for Rehabilitation The 4 MWT and the 10 MWT are simple methods and were also shown to be reliable measurement methods in many patient groups. This study illustrates that the test-retest reliability of the 4 MWT and 10 MWT are excellent in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery during inpatient rehabilitation (ICC: 0.94 for 4 MWT, ICC: 0.95 for 10 MWT). Clinicians and researchers can be confident that changes above the SRD95s for the different patient groups, for both sexes and with regard to weight-bearing status represent a real clinical change in rehabilitation process.},

DATA SOURCES: Nine electronic databases searched from inception to March 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials comparing exercise interventions with each other or with no exercise control for adults with knee or hip osteoarthritis. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers evaluated eligibility and methodological quality. Main outcomes extracted were pain intensity and limitation of function. Trial sequential analysis was used to investigate reliability and conclusiveness of available evidence for exercise interventions. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to combine both direct (within trial) and indirect (between trial) evidence on treatment effectiveness. RESULTS: 60 trials (44 knee, two hip, 14 mixed) covering 12 exercise interventions and with 8218 patients met inclusion criteria. Sequential analysis showed that as of 2002 sufficient evidence had been accrued to show significant benefit of exercise interventions over no exercise control. For pain relief, strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening, flexibility plus strengthening plus aerobic, aquatic strengthening, and aquatic strengthening plus flexibility, exercises were significantly more effective than no exercise control. A combined intervention of strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise was also significantly more effective than no exercise control for improving limitation in function (standardised mean difference -0.63, 95\% credible interval -1.16 to -0.10). CONCLUSIONS: As of 2002 sufficient evidence had accumulated to show significant benefit of exercise over no exercise in patients with osteoarthritis, and further trials are unlikely to overturn this result. An approach combining exercises to increase strength, flexibility, and aerobic capacity is likely to be most effective in the management of lower limb osteoarthritis. The evidence is largely from trials in patients with knee osteoarthritis. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) No CRD42012002267.},

For decades, the conventional wisdom has been that the consumption of saturated fat (SFA) undermines cardiovascular health, clogs the arteries, increases risk of CVD, and leads to heart attacks. It is timely to investigate whether this claim holds up to scientific scrutiny. The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss recent scientific evidence on the association between dietary SFA and CVD.                                         Methods and results               PubMed, Google scholar, and Scopus were searched for articles published between 2010 and 2021 on the association between SFA consumption and CVD risk and outcomes. A review was conducted examining observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, and long-term RCTs. Collectively, neither observational studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have conclusively established a significant association between SFA in the diet and subsequent cardiovascular risk and coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or mortality nor a benefit of reducing dietary SFAs on CVD rick, events, and mortality. Beneficial effects of replacement of SFA by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat or carbohydrates remain elusive.                                         Conclusion               Findings from the studies reviewed in this paper indicate that the consumption of SFA is not significantly associated with CVD risk, events, or mortality. Based on the scientific evidence, there is no scientific ground to demonize SFA as a cause of CVD. SFA naturally occurring in nutrient-dense foods can be safely included in the diet.},

Patients with trunk trauma suffer blood loss, inflammation and hypoxia and are at risk of developing respiratory and musculoskeletal complications during their recovery. Physiotherapists are an integral part of the interprofessional team that manages patients who sustain trunk trauma. OBJECTIVES: To describe the physiotherapy management of adult patients with trunk trauma, their quality of life, post-discharge rehabilitation service provision, and outcome measures used in the physiotherapy management. METHOD: A non-systematic narrative review of published literature was performed. RESULTS: Mobilisation, functional exercises, deep breathing exercises and active coughing are used to optimise patients' respiratory and musculoskeletal functioning. Some physiotherapists educate patients on the use of pain management strategies to reduce discomfort from rib fractures, surgical sites and intercostal drainage bottle tubing. Survivors of trunk trauma experience limitations in physical function up to two years. Little is known about post-discharge rehabilitation service provision to these patients after discharge. Few physiotherapists use outcome measures as part of their daily clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Physiotherapy management of patients with blunt or penetrating trunk trauma during hospitalisation and after discharge is a field of clinical practice that is rich for high-quality research related to service provision, cost analysis and interventions used. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Physiotherapy clinicians and researchers can use the findings of this review as a guide to their management of adult patients recovering from trunk trauma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of soccer (football) injuries is among the highest in sports. Despite this high rate, insufficient evidence is available on the efficacy of preventive training programmes on injury incidence. OBJECTIVE: To systematically study the evidence on preventive exercise-based training programmes to reduce the incidence of injuries in soccer. DATA SOURCES: The databases EMBASE/MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, PEDro and SPORTDiscus™ were searched for relevant articles, from inception until 20 December 2011. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the PEDro scale. STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria for this review were (1) randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials; (2) primary outcome of the study is the number of soccer injuries and/or injury incidence; (3) intervention focusing on a preventive training programme, including a set of exercises aimed at improving strength, coordination, flexibility or agility; and (4) study sample of soccer players (no restrictions as to level of play, age or sex). The exclusion criteria were: (1) the article was not available as full text; (2) the article was not published in English, German or Dutch; and (3) the trial and/or training programme relates only to specific injuries and/or specific joints. To compare the effects of the different interventions, we calculated the incidence risk ratio (IRR) for each study. RESULTS: Six studies involving a total of 6,099 participants met the inclusion criteria. The results of the included studies were contradictory. Two of the six studies (one of high and one of moderate quality) reported a statistical significant reduction in terms of their primary outcome, i.e. injuries overall. Four of the six studies described an overall preventive effect (IRR{$<$}1), although the effect of one study was not statistically significant. The three studies that described a significant preventive effect were of high, moderate and low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicting evidence has been found for the effectiveness of exercise-based programmes to prevent soccer injuries. Some reasons for the contradictory findings could be different study samples (in terms of sex and soccer type) in the included studies, differences between the intervention programmes implemented (in terms of content, training frequency and duration) and compliance with the programme. High-quality studies investigating the best type and intensity of exercises in a generic training programme are needed to reduce the incidence of injuries in soccer effectively.},

  abstract = {Conservative non-surgical management of a herniated lumbar intervertebral disc (HLD) in athletes is a complex task due to the dramatic forces imparted on the spine during sport participation. The demands placed upon the athlete during rehabilitation and return to sport are unique not only from a sport specific perspective, but also regarding return to the sport strength and conditioning programs utilized for sport preparation. Many prescriptions fail to address postural and motor control faults specific to athletic development, which may prevent full return to sport after suffering a HLD or predispose the athlete to future exacerbations of a HLD. Strength exercises involving squatting, deadlifting, and Olympic power lifts are large components of the typical athlete's conditioning program, therefore some progressions are provided to address potential underlying problems in the athlete's technique that may have contributed to their HLD in the first place. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to propose a framework for rehabilitation that is built around the phases of healing of the disc. Phase I: Non-Rotational/Non-Flexion Phase (Acute Inflammatory Phase), Phase II: Counter rotation/Flexion Phase (Repair Phase), Phase III: Rotational Phase/Power development (Remodeling Phase), and Phase IV: Full return to sport. This clinical commentary provides a theoretical basis for these phases based on available literature as well as reviewing many popular current practice trends in the management of an HLD. The authors recognize the limits of any general exercise rehabilitation recommendation with regard to return to sport, as well as any general strength and conditioning program. It is vital that an individual assessment and prescription is made for every athlete which reviews and addresses movement in all planes of motion under all necessary extrinsic and intrinsic demands to that athlete.

RECENT FINDINGS               With a prevalence of 1\% to 3\% and substantial comorbidity, high lifetime costs, and emotional burden, intellectual developmental disorder is characterized by limitations in both intellectual functioning (IQ less than 70) and adaptive behavior starting before 18 years of age. Pinpointing the precise genetic cause is important, as it allows for accurate genetic counseling, avoidance of unnecessary testing, prognostication, and tailored  management, which, for an increasing number of genetic conditions, targets the pathophysiology and improves outcomes.                                         SUMMARY               The etiology of intellectual developmental disorder is heterogeneous, which mandates a structured approach that considers family situation, test costs, yield, and potential therapeutic tractability of the identified condition. Diagnosis of an underlying genetic cause is increasingly important with the advent of new treatments. Still, in many cases, the cause remains unknown, and research is needed to elucidate its complex molecular basis.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two radiologists independently reviewed MRIs of 212 knees performed after an acute lateral patellar dislocation to evaluate the presence of high-grade patellar osteochondral injury, femoral osteochondral injury, and medial patellofemoral ligament injury. The association of skeletal maturity (indicated by a closed distal femoral physis), age, sex, and first-time versus recurrent dislocation with each of these various lesions was analyzed using Chi-square or T test, and multivariable logistic regression with estimation of odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: Skeletal maturity was significantly associated with high-grade patellar osteochondral injury [OR=2.72 (95\% CI 1.00, 7.36); p=0.049] and femoral-side MPFL tear [OR=2.34 (95\% CI 1.05, 5.25); p=0.039]. Skeletal immaturity was significantly associated with patellar-side MPFL tear [OR=0.35 (95\% CI 0.14, 0.90); p=0.029]. CONCLUSION: Patterns of injury to the patella and medial patellofemoral ligament vary notably between the skeletally immature and mature, and these variations may be explained by the inherent weakness of the patellar secondary physis.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(3): 888-900, 2020-Combat sports (CS) are intermittent by nature and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been used as a tool to maintain and improve physical fitness among CS athletes. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis about chronic effects of HIIT in CS athletes. An electronic search was performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar using the following Boolean criteria: ("CS" OR "martial arts" OR "judo" OR "taekwondo" OR "jiu jitsu" OR "boxing" OR "karate" OR "wrestling" OR "wushu" OR "kung fu") AND ("HIIT" OR "intermittent exercise" OR "sprint interval training" OR "repeated sprint training [RST]"). To be included, the studies needed to be original, involve CS athletes, present HIIT intervention protocol (HIIT, sprint interval training [SIT] or RST), and analyze chronic physiological outcomes. From 2,211 identified studies, after screening and eligibility evaluation, 12 studies were included in this review with meta-analysis. Aerobic (aerobic capacity, heart rate, and maximum oxygen uptake), anaerobic (peak and mean power in single and successive Wingate tests, and blood lactate concentration), and anthropometric outcomes (body mass and body fat percentage) were evaluated. Data of 255 subjects from 12 studies were assessed. Regarding methodological quality, 7 studies obtained 9-10/12 on the TESTEX scale. For the interventions, 5 studies used HIIT, 4 studies used RST protocols, one used SIT protocols, and one used an intermittent protocol that could not be classified. Relating to aerobic power, was found an increase in V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, with a mean difference (MD) of 2.83 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min (CI 95\% = 0.40-5.25; p {$<$} 0.001) for striking and 2.36 ml{$\cdot$}kg{$\cdot$}min (CI 95\% = 1.05-3.66; p {$<$} 0.001) for grappling athletes. No differences on anaerobic peak power for striking (MD = 0.67 W; CI 95\% = -0.43 to 1.77; p = 0.23) were found, and a statistical improvement for grappling athletes, (MD = 0.51 W; CI 95\% = 0.03-0.98; p = 0.04) was found. Seven studies analyzed anthropometric variables, with differences for body mass in striking (MD = -0.93 kg; CI 95\% = -1.68 to -0.19; p = 0.01) and no differences for grappling (MD = -0.09 kg; CI 95\% = -2.80 to 2.62; p = 0.95). Differences in body fat percentage in striking (MD = 0.50\%; CI 95\% = 0.30-0.70; p {$<$} 0.001) and no differences in grappling (MD = -0.87\%; CI 95\% = -1.77 to 0.03; p = 0.06) were found. It was concluded that HIIT positively influences maximum oxygen uptake and anaerobic power in combat sport athletes, with a minor impact on body composition.},

  abstract = {Multi-copper oxidases (MCOs) are a small group of enzymes that oxidize their substrate with the concomitant reduction of dioxygen to two water molecules. Generally, multi-copper oxidases are promiscuous with regards to their reducing substrates and are capable of performing various functions in different species. To date, three multi-copper oxidases have been detected in humans--ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and zyklopen. Each of these enzymes has a high specificity towards iron with the resulting ferroxidase activity being associated with ferroportin, the only known iron exporter protein in humans. Ferroportin exports iron as Fe(2+), but transferrin, the major iron transporter protein of blood, can bind only Fe(3+) effectively. Iron oxidation in enterocytes is mediated mainly by hephaestin thus allowing dietary iron to enter the bloodstream. Zyklopen is involved in iron efflux from placental trophoblasts during iron transfer from mother to fetus. Release of iron from the liver relies on ferroportin and the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin which is found in blood in a soluble form. Ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and zyklopen show distinctive expression patterns and have unique mechanisms for regulating their expression. These features of human multi-copper ferroxidases can serve as a basis for the precise control of iron efflux in different tissues. In this manuscript, we review the biochemical and biological properties of the three human MCOs and discuss their potential roles in human iron homeostasis.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The epidemiology of infectious encephalitis and brain abscess has changed in recent years. Vaccination has reduced the incidence of certain viruses associated with encephalitis, while a decrease in fulminant otogenic infections has led to fewer brain abscesses associated with otitis media. However, changes in climate and human population density and distribution have enabled the emergence of newer pathogens and expanded the geographic range of others, and greater adoption of intensive immunosuppressive regimens for autoimmune conditions has increased the risk of opportunistic infections of the brain. The widespread use of early neuroimaging, along with improved diagnostic methodologies for pathogen detection, newer antimicrobial therapies with better brain penetration, and less invasive neurosurgical techniques, has resulted in better outcomes for patients with infectious encephalitis and brain abscess. Novel technologies including metagenomic next-generation sequencing are increasingly being applied to these conditions in an effort to improve diagnosis. Nevertheless, both infectious encephalitis and brain abscess continue to be associated with substantial mortality.                                         SUMMARY               Infectious encephalitis and brain abscess can present as neurologic emergencies and require rapid assessment, thorough and appropriate diagnostic testing, and early initiation of empiric therapies directed against infectious agents. Close clinical follow-up, proper interpretation of diagnostic results, and appropriate tailoring of therapeutic agents are essential to optimizing outcomes. Diagnosis and management of parenchymal brain infections are complex and often best achieved with a multidisciplinary care team involving neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, infectious disease physicians, and pathologists.},

This article provides an overview of autonomic disorders with potential autoimmune etiology.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Recent evidence highlights a close association between the autonomic nervous system and inflammation. The autonomic nervous system regulates immune function, and autonomic manifestations may occur in a number of systemic autoimmune diseases. In a few instances, autoimmunity directly influences autonomic function. Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is the prototypic antibody-mediated autonomic disorder. Over time, a better understanding of the clinical spectrum of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, the significance of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies, other immune-mediated autonomic neuropathies, and autonomic manifestations of other systemic or neurologic autoimmune disorders has emerged.                                         SUMMARY               Autoimmune autonomic disorders may be challenging, but correct identification of these conditions is important.

  abstract = {Patellar tendinopathy is a common clinical problem, but its underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood, primarily due to the absence of a representative experimental model. The most widely used method to generate such a model is collagenase injection, although this method possesses limitations. We developed an optimized rat model of patellar tendinopathy via the ultrasound-guided injection of collagenase mixed with a thermo-responsive Pluronic hydrogel into the patellar tendon of sixty male Wistar rats. All analyses were carried out at 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days post-injury. We confirmed that our rat model reproduced the pathophysiology observed in human patients through analyses of ultrasonography, histology, immunofluorescence, and biomechanical parameters. Tendons that were injured by the injection of the collagenase-Pluronic mixture exhibited a significant increase in the cross-sectional area (p {$<$} 0.01), a high degree of tissue disorganization and hypercellularity, significantly strong neovascularization (p {$<$} 0.01), important changes in the levels of types I and III collagen expression, and the organization and presence of intra-tendinous calcifications. Decreases in the maximum rupture force and stiffness were also observed. These results demonstrate that our model replicates the key features observed in human patellar tendinopathy. Collagenase is evenly distributed, as the Pluronic hydrogel prevents its leakage and thus, damage to surrounding tissues. Therefore, this model is valuable for testing new treatments for patellar tendinopathy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Bradykinesia and muscle weaknesses are common symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and are associated with impaired functional performance, increased risk of falls, and reduced quality of life. Recent studies have pointed to progressive resistance training (PRT) as an effective method to control and reduce these symptoms, increasing possibilities to treat the disease. However, few studies have focused on assessing the PRT effects in the short-term. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the short-term PRT effects on people with PD, in order to offer new parameters for a better understanding of its effects, so as an adequation and PRT use as a complementary therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty individuals diagnosed with PD from stage 1 to 3 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale took part on the study and were allocated into 2 groups; Training Group (TG) performed a 9-week RT program twice a week, and the Control Group (CG) attended disease lectures. Bradykinesia UPDRS subscale (BSS), knee extensors isokinetic strength, Ten Meters Walk Test (TMW), Timed Up\&Go Test (TUG) and 30-Second Chair Stand (T30) were measured before and after the intervention period. Statistical significance was set at p {$\leq$} 0.05. RESULTS: Significant time was noted by the group interaction for all functional tests (TUG, T30, and TWM; all p {$<$} 0.01) and BSS (p {$<$} 0.01). Post hoc analyses revealed that these differences were driven by significant improvements in these dependent variables (all p {$<$} 0.01) while the CG remained unchanged (all p {$>$} 0.05). Moreover, TUG, T30, TWM, and BSS were significantly different between TG and CG in the post-training assessments (all p {$<$} 0.01). Isokinetic muscle strength was slightly increased in the TG (2.4\%) and decreased in the CG (-2.2\%), but statistical analyses did not reach significance for interaction but only a trend (p = 0.12). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that 9 weeks of PRT reduces bradykinesia and improves functional performance in patients with mild to moderate PD. These findings reinforce this mode of exercise as an important component of public health promotion programs for PD.},

Many anatomical variations of plantaris muscle have been reported previously, including its inconstancy. Evolutional studies strongly suggest that plantaris muscle is a rudimentary muscle that plays minor role in gait biomechanics. However, plantaris muscle seems to have very important proprioceptive role since it has very high density of muscle spindles. Clinically, plantaris muscle is involved in differential diagnosis of posterior leg pain and several pathological entities such as: plantaris muscle rupture, non-insertional Achilles tendinopathy and popliteal artery compression syndrome. Different surgical specialties have recognized plantaris muscle tendon as a valuable graft. However, literature on plantaris muscle tendon biomechanical properties is rather scant and inconsistent with several limitations for proper data comparison and interpretation. Further comparative studies are needed to properly define biomechanical properties of plantaris muscle tendon grafts for various ligament and tendon reconstructive procedures.},

SUMMARY               Early recognition of neurologic adverse medication reactions can be challenging but is essential to prompt discontinuation of the offending medication or administration of specific symptomatic treatments in select cases. A high index of suspicion is needed to arrive at the correct diagnosis promptly, initiate a treatment plan, limit unnecessary testing, and reduce overall health care cost burden.},

  abstract = {We investigated whether, during maximal exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow is as high as during resting hyperpnoea at the same work of breathing. We hypothesized that during exercise, intercostal muscle blood flow would be limited by competition from the locomotor muscles. Intercostal (probe over the 7th intercostal space) and vastus lateralis muscle perfusion were measured simultaneously in ten trained cyclists by near-infrared spectroscopy using indocyanine green dye. Measurements were made at several exercise intensities up to maximal (WRmax) and subsequently during resting isocapnic hyperpnoea at minute ventilation levels up to those at WRmax. During resting hyperpnoea, intercostal muscle blood flow increased linearly with the work of breathing (R2 = 0.94) to 73.0 +/- 8.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at the ventilation seen at WRmax (work of breathing approximately 550-600 J min-1), but during exercise it peaked at 80\% WRmax (53.4 +/- 10.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1), significantly falling to 24.7 +/- 5.3 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 at WRmax. At maximal ventilation intercostal muscle vascular conductance was significantly lower during exercise (0.22 +/- 0.05 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1) compared to isocapnic hyperpnoea (0.77 +/- 0.13 ml min-1 (100 g)-1 mmHg-1). During exercise, both cardiac output and vastus lateralis muscle blood flow also plateaued at about 80\% WRmax (the latter at 95.4 +/- 11.8 ml min-1 (100 g)-1). In conclusion, during exercise above 80\% WRmax in trained subjects, intercostal muscle blood flow and vascular conductance are less than during resting hyperpnoea at the same minute ventilation. This suggests that the circulatory system is unable to meet the demands of both locomotor and intercostal muscles during heavy exercise, requiring greater O2 extraction and likely contributing to respiratory muscle fatigue.},

  abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? The work presented here focuses mostly on testing the theory of blood flow redistribution from the locomotor to the respiratory muscles during heavy exercise in healthy participants and in patients with COPD. What advances does it highlight? Studies presented and the direct experimental approach to measure muscle blood flow by indocyanine green dye detected by near infrared spectroscopy, show that exercise interferes with respiratory muscle blood flow especially in COPD, but even in healthy. ABSTRACT: We have developed an indicator-dilution method to measure muscle blood flow at rest and during exercise using the light absorbing tracer indocyanine green dye (ICG) injected as an intravenous bolus, with surface optodes placed over muscles of interest to record the ICG signal by near-infrared spectroscopy. Here we review findings for both quadriceps and intercostal muscle blood flow (measured simultaneously) in trained cyclists and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During resting hyperpnoea in both athletes and patients, intercostal muscle blood flow increased with ventilation, correlating closely and linearly with the work of breathing, with no change in quadriceps flow. During graded exercise in athletes, intercostal flow at first increased, but then began to fall approaching peak effort. Unexpectedly, in COPD, intercostal muscle blood flow during exercise fell progressively from resting values, contrasting sharply with the response to resting hyperpnoea. During exercise at peak intensity, we found no quadriceps blood flow reduction in favour of the respiratory muscles in either athletes or patients. In COPD at peak exercise, when patients breathed 21\% oxygen in helium or 100\% oxygen, there was no redistribution of blood flow observed between legs and respiratory muscles in either direction. Evidence of decrease in leg blood flow and increase in respiratory muscle flow was found only when imposing expiratory flow limitation (EFL) during exercise in healthy individuals. However, because EFL caused substantial physiological derangement, lowering arterial oxygen saturation and raising end-tidal PCO2 and heart rate, these results cannot be projected onto normal exercise.},

This article reviews the history and physical examination features pertinent for diagnosis, differential diagnoses, and treatments and approaches for optimal control of symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                Essential tremor is a syndrome with symptoms extending beyond tremor to involve disturbances in gait, speech, cognition, and mood. Although the new guidelines on the definition and biaxial classification scheme have provided clarity, some tremor experts have critiqued the recently coined term                 essential tremor plus                 . For treatment, new orthotic devices and peripheral stimulation devices are now available in addition to pharmacologic and surgical options.                                                        SUMMARY               Essential tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology with many subtleties and nuances. A detailed history with open-ended questions and focused questions encompassing medical history, social history, and family history is key for establishing the diagnosis. The presence of bilateral action tremor for 3 years and absence of isolated head and voice tremor and absence of task- and position-dependent tremor are necessary for diagnosis. Dystonic tremor, Parkinson disease tremor, physiologic tremor, and drug-induced tremor are common differential diagnoses. Differentiating these tremor disorders from essential tremor based on phenomenology and physical examination alone could be challenging; thus, clinicians should seek additional clues from a detailed history. Treatment could begin with noninvasive and nonpharmacologic therapies, especially in mild cases. As the severity increases, they can advance stepwise to include pharmacotherapies and surgical interventions. With the growing recognition that essential tremor is not a monosymptomatic disorder, management should involve a multidisciplinary team. Furthermore, treatment selection should be based on shared decision making between patients and providers that gives due consideration to severity of symptoms, level of functional disability, impact on social interactions, patient preferences, and patient expectations.},

This article reviews the phenotype and pathophysiology of the disease as well as the recent efforts in clinical outcome measures and clinical trials.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                As the name implies, FSHD involves weakness of facial muscles, muscles that fix the scapula, and muscles overlying the humerus (biceps and triceps). The distinctive phenotype of FSHD occurs secondary to two different genetic mechanisms. FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) is due to a deletion on chromosome 4q, leading to hypomethylation and derepression of                 DUX4                 . FSHD type 2 (FSHD2) is due to mutations in                 SMCHD1                 with resulting hypomethylation of the same subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q and derepression of                 DUX4                 . Understanding the central role of                 DUX4                 has opened up the possibility of disease-modifying treatments. In preparation for clinical trials of novel agents, researchers are in the process of validating a number of clinical trial outcome measures including MRI, the 6-minute walk test, the FSHD Composite Outcome Measure, reachable workspace, electrical impedance myography, and the FSHD Health Index.

While past clinical trials in FSHD have been largely disappointing, novel agents in development, including antisense oligonucleotides, gene therapy, and small molecules, hold promise for future meaningful therapies.},

This article discusses an approach to the recognition and management of seizures, stroke, and cardiac arrest as complications of other critical illnesses in the pediatric intensive care unit.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Convulsive and nonconvulsive seizures occur frequently in children after cardiac arrest or traumatic brain injury and during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Seizures may add to neurologic morbidity, and continuous EEG monitoring is needed for up to 24 hours for detection. Hypothermia has not been shown to improve outcome after cardiac arrest in children, but targeted temperature management with controlled normothermia and prevention of fever is a mainstay of neuroprotection.

In the last decade an increasing number of reports continue to support a bidirectional and symbiotic relationship between sleep and memory. Studies using procedural and declarative learning tasks have demonstrated the need for sleep after learning in the offline consolidation of new memories. Furthermore, these consolidation benefits appear to be mediated by an overnight neural reorganization of memory that may result in a more efficient storage of information, affording improved next-day recall. Sleep before learning also appears to be critical for brain functioning. Specifically, one night of sleep deprivation markedly impairs hippocampal function, imposing a deficit in the ability to commit new experiences to memory. Taken together, these observations are of particular ecologic importance from a professional and education perspective when considering that sleep time continues to decrease across all age ranges throughout industrialized nations.},

This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most commonly recommended treatment for multidirectional instability (MDI) of the glenohumeral joint is exercise-based management. The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise-based management in patients with MDI. The secondary aim was to observe the types of exercise protocols and outcomes used, as well as any adverse results associated with exercise. METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PEDro, Current Contents, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Australasian Medical Index (AMI), Ausport, and Clinical Trials Registers were searched for published and unpublished studies from the inception date to June 2012 using the keywords multidirectional instability, glenohumeral, and exercise. Selection criteria included all study designs (except case reports and case series) and participants with clinically diagnosed MDI using exercise-based management. Inclusion criteria were not limited by outcomes. The authors' own risk-of-bias tool was used for quality assessment of studies. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to synthesize the evidence. RESULTS: The risk of bias was high in all 7 included studies. For before-and-after comparisons of exercise-based management, GRADE assessment showed very low-quality evidence for improvements in shoulder kinematics, the Rowe score, overall status rating, and peak muscle strength. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of exercise-based management on MDI was variable across the included studies because of study heterogeneity and a high level of bias. There is a need for high-quality intervention studies to be undertaken to validate the effect of exercise for MDI.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The prevalence of MS has increased in recent decades, and costs of care for patients with MS have risen dramatically. Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals may be at risk for more severe MS-related disability. Multiple genetic MS risk factors have been identified. Factors such as low vitamin D levels and a history of Epstein-Barr virus, smoking, and obesity, especially during childhood, also influence MS risk. Traditionally thought to be a T-cell--mediated disease, recent research has highlighted the additional roles of B cells and microglia in both relapsing and progressive MS.                                         SUMMARY               Complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors affect the risk for MS as well as the disease course. People of color have historically been underrepresented in both MS clinical trials and literature, but current research is attempting to better clarify unique considerations in these groups. MS pathology consists of the focal inflammatory lesions that have been well characterized in relapsing MS, as well as a more widespread neurodegenerative component that is posited to drive progressive disease. Recent advances in characterization of both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative aspects of MS pathophysiology have yielded potential targets for future therapeutic options.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Joint mobilizations are often quantified using a 4-point grading system based on the physiotherapist's detection of resistance. It is suggested that the initial resistance to joint mobilizations is imperceptible to physiotherapists, but that at some point through range becomes perceptible, a point termed R1. Grades of mobilization traditionally hinge around this concept and are performed either before or after R1. Physiotherapists, however, show poor reliability in applying grades of mobilization. The definition of R1 is ambiguous and dependent on the skills of the individual physiotherapist. The aim of this study is to test a revised grading system where R1 is considered at the beginning of range, and the entire range, as perceived by the physiotherapists maximum force application, is divided into three, creating 3 grades of mobilization. METHOD: Thirty-two post-registration physiotherapists and nineteen pre-registration students assessed end of range (point R2) and then applied 3 grades of AP mobilizations, over the talus, in an asymptomatic models ankle. Vertical forces were recorded through a force platform. Intra-class Correlation Coefficients, Standard Error of Measurement, and Minimal Detectable Change were calculated to explore intra-rater reliability on intra-day and inter-day testing. T-tests determined group differences. RESULTS: Intra-rater reliability was excellent for intra-day testing (ICC 0.96-0.97), and inter-day testing (ICC 0.85-0.93). No statistical difference was found between pre- and post-registration groups. DISCUSSION: Standardizing the definition of grades of mobilization, by moving R1 to the beginning of range and separating grades into thirds, results in excellent intra-rater reliability on intra-day and inter-day tests. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3b.},

  abstract = {Bell palsy is the most common peripheral paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve with an onset that is rapid and unilateral. The diagnosis is one of exclusion and is most often made on physical exam. The facial nerve has both an intracranial,~intratemporal, and extratemporal course as its branches. The facial nerve has a motor and parasympathetic function as well as taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.~This nerve also controls salivary and lacrimal glands. The motor function of the peripheral facial nerve controls the upper and lower facial muscles. As a result, the diagnosis of Bell palsy requires special attention to forehead muscle strength. If forehead strength is preserved, a central cause of weakness should be considered. Although the utility of antivirals has been called into question, treatment is medical with most sources recommending a combination of corticosteroids and antiviral medication. Bell palsy is the most common cause of unilateral facial paralysis. Bell palsy is more common in~patients with diabetes~or who are pregnant.},

  abstract = {While cryotherapy has been shown to decrease postoperative pain after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, less is known of the effects of combined cryotherapy and compression. The goal of this study was to compare subjective and objective patient outcomes following ACL reconstruction with combined compression and cryotherapy compared with traditional ice therapy alone. Patients undergoing ACL reconstruction were randomized to cryotherapy/compression device (group 1) or a standardized ice pack (group 2). Both groups were instructed to use the ice or cryotherapy/compression device three times per day and return to the clinic at 1, 2, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Patient-derived outcome measurements used in this study consisted of the visual analog scale (VAS), the Lysholm knee score, Short Form-36 (SF-36), and single assessment numerical evaluation (SANE). Circumferential measurements of the knee at three locations (1 cm proximal to patella, mid-patella, and 1 cm distal to patella) were also obtained as a measure of postoperative edema. Narcotic medication use was recorded by questionnaire. The primary outcome measure (VAS) was significantly different among groups in the preoperative measurement, despite similarities in group demographics. Baseline VAS for group 1 was 54.9 compared with group 2 at 35.6 (p = 0.01). By 6 weeks, this had lowered to 28.1 and 40.3, respectively, resulting in a significant 27-point decrease in mean VAS for group 1 (p {$<$} 0.0001). However, the small increase in VAS for group 2 was not significant (p = 0.34). No significant differences were noted for the Lysholm, SF-36, or SANE scores either between groups or time points. Furthermore, no significant differences were noted for any of the circumferential measurements either between groups or time points. Of all patients, 83\% of group 1 discontinued narcotic use by 6 weeks, compared with only 28\% of group 2 (p = 0.0008). The use of combined cryotherapy and compression in the postoperative period after ACL reconstruction results in improved, short-term pain relief and a greater likelihood of independence from narcotic use compared with cryotherapy alone.},

This article examines the evidence for using the available options.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Carotid endarterectomy is an effective treatment option for reducing the risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients. Patients should be stratified for future stroke risk based on both the degree of stenosis and the presence of symptoms referable to the culprit lesion. Carotid stenting is also useful in reducing stroke risk, again in carefully selected patients. Because of the publication of significant data regarding both carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in the last several years, selection can be far more personalized and refined for individual patients based on demographics, sex, patient preference, and medical comorbidities. Routine extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery remains unproven as a therapeutic option for large vessel occlusion in reducing the incidence of ischemic stroke although some carefully screened patient populations remaining at high risk may benefit; procedural risks and pathology related to alterations in blood flow dynamics are challenges to overcome. Indirect revascularization remains an appropriate solution for carefully selected patients with cerebral large vessel steno-occlusive disease, and multiple variations of surgical technique are patient specific. Indirect revascularization may benefit from clinical trials with larger patient populations for validation in specific pathologies and offers the advantages of lower surgical complication rates and reduced risk of pathologic responses to altered cerebral flow dynamics.                                         SUMMARY               Surgical solutions to reduce stroke risk provide important alternatives in appropriately selected patients and should be considered in addition to medical management and lifestyle modification for optimizing patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is an urgent global public health concern. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is an intervention used in the management of CMP aiming to reconceptualize an individual's understanding of their pain as less threatening. This mixed-methods review undertook a segregated synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies to investigate the clinical effectiveness, and patients' experience of, PNE for people with CMP. Electronic databases were searched for studies published between January 1, 2002, and June 14, 2018. Twelve randomized, controlled trials (n\,=\,755 participants) that reported pain, disability, and psychosocial outcomes and 4 qualitative studies (n\,=\,50 participants) that explored patients experience of PNE were included. The meta-analyzed pooled treatment effects for PNE versus control had low clinical relevance in the short term for pain (-5.91/100; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -13.75 to 1.93) and disability (-4.09/100; 95\% CI, -7.72 to -.45) and in the medium term for pain (-6.27/100; 95\% CI, -18.97 to 6.44) and disability (-8.14/100; 95\% CI, -15.60 to -.68). The treatment effect of PNE for kinesiophobia was clinically relevant in the short term (-13.55/100; 95\% CI, -25.89 to -1.21) and for pain catastrophizing in the medium term (-5.26/52; 95\% CI, -10.59 to .08). A metasynthesis of 23 qualitative findings resulted in the identification of 2 synthesized findings that identified several key components important for enhancing the patient experience of PNE, such as allowing the patient to tell their own story. These components can enhance pain reconceptualization, which seems to be an important process to facilitate patients' ability to cope with their condition. The protocol was published on PROSPERO (CRD42017068436). Perspective: We outline the effectiveness of PNE for the management of pain, disability, and psychosocial outcomes in adults with CMP. Key components that can enhance the patient experience of PNE, such as allowing the patient to tell their own story, are also presented. These components may enhance pain reconceptualization.},

Youth soccer has a greater reported injury rate than many other contact sports, and recent studies suggest that injury rates are increasing. Large increases in the incidence of concussions in youth soccer have been reported, and anterior cruciate ligament injuries remain a significant problem in this sport, particularly among female athletes. Considerable new research has identified a number of modifiable risk factors for lower-extremity injuries and concussion, and several prevention programs have been identified to reduce the risk of injury. Rule enforcement and fair play also serve an important role in reducing the risk of injury among youth soccer participants.

As neurologic dysfunction is one of the most frequent complications of these diseases and may even be the presenting symptom, it is important to be familiar with these complications to foster early recognition and intervention.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Advances have been made in the identification of which patients can safely undergo valvular surgery for treatment of infective endocarditis in the setting of stroke, which, ideally, will minimize the risk of recurrent stroke in these patients. Additionally, technologic advances are improving our ability to use a multimodal approach for prognostication after cardiac arrest.                                         SUMMARY               The neurologic complications from the described disorders range from cerebrovascular complications to encephalitis, cognitive impairment, sleep-disordered breathing, headache, and increased intracranial pressure leading to coma or even death.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of meniscal injuries at the time of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) can result in restrictions on weightbearing and range of motion in the early rehabilitative phases. What is unknown is the effect of (1) meniscal tear type and location at the time of anterior cruciate ligament injury and (2) meniscal treatment at the time of ACLR on quadriceps strength in adolescents during the late rehabilitative phase. HYPOTHESIS: Meniscal tears involving the root and requiring repair would adversely affect quadriceps strength at 6 to 9 months postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Patients who underwent ACLR at 1 of 2 research sites between 2013 and 2021 were identified. Adolescent participants were included if they were between the ages of 12 and 20 years at the time of assessment and had undergone primary unilateral ACLR in the previous 6 to 9 months. Participants were subgrouped by meniscal tear type (no tear, nonroot tear, root tear) and meniscal treatment at the time of ACLR (no treatment, meniscectomy, meniscal repair), which were confirmed via chart review. Isokinetic strength testing occurred at 60 deg/s, and quadriceps strength and quadriceps strength limb symmetry index were compared between the meniscal tear type and meniscal procedure subgroups using analysis of covariance while controlling for the effects of age, sex, and ACLR graft source. RESULTS: An overall 236 patients were included in this analysis (109 male, 127 female; mean {\textpm} SD age, 16.0 {\textpm} 1.9 years). There were no significant differences in ACLR limb quadriceps strength based on meniscal tear type (P = .61) or meniscal procedure at the time of ACLR (P = .61), after controlling for age, biological sex, and ACLR graft source. Similarly, quadriceps strength limb symmetry index did not differ by meniscal tear type (P = .38) or meniscal procedure at the time of ACLR (P = .40). CONCLUSION: Meniscal tear type and treatment at the time of ACLR did not affect quadriceps strength or quadriceps strength symmetry in adolescents 6 to 9 months after ACLR.},

A multidisciplinary workgroup of US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense amputation care subject matter experts was formed, and an extensive literature search was performed which identified 3685 citations published from January 2007 to July 2016. Articles were excluded based on established review criteria resulting in 74 studies being considered as evidence addressing one or more of the identified key issues. The identified literature was evaluated and graded using the National Academies of Science GRADE criteria. Recommendations were formulated after extensive review. Eighteen recommendations were confirmed with four having strong evidence and workgroup confidence in the recommendation. Key recommendations address patient and caregiver education, consideration for the use of rigid and semirigid dressings, consideration for the use of microprocessor knees, and managed lifetime care that includes annual transdisciplinary assessments. In conclusion, this clinical practice guideline used the best available evidence from the past 10 yrs to provide key management recommendations to enhance the quality and consistency of rehabilitation care for persons with lower limb amputation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Anterior Cruciate Ligament Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scale is a reliable and valid tool for evaluation of psychological readiness to return to sport after ACL injury, but its responsiveness to change has not been extensively evaluated. PURPOSE: To determine the responsiveness of the ACL-RSI scale. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: The ACL-RSI scale and the knee confidence question from the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Quality of Life subscale was completed at 6 and 12 months after ACL reconstruction surgery. Responsiveness was assessed using distribution and anchor-based methods for the full- and short-form versions of the scale and subgroup analyzed for sex. From distribution statistics, the standardized response mean (SRM) and the smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated. Using the anchor-based method, the minimally important change (MIC) that was associated with an improvement in knee confidence was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 441 patients (257 men, 184 women; mean age of 25 years) were included in this study. An SRM of 0.7 was found for both versions, indicating a moderate level of responsiveness. The MIC was 13.4 points for the full-form version and 15.1 points for the short-form version. These values were larger than SDC values at the group level but not at the individual patient level. Responsiveness was similar between male and female patients. CONCLUSION: The ACL-RSI scale had sufficient responsiveness to investigate the efficacy of an intervention at a group level, but it may be more limited at an individual patient level.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Sporadic IBM is the most common acquired muscle disease in patients older than 50 years of age and is becoming more prevalent because of the increasing age of the population, the emerging development of more inclusive diagnostic criteria, and the advent of a diagnostic autoantibody. No effective therapy is known, and the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. Some pathogenic insight can be gleaned from other myopathies with pathologic similarities or hereditary inclusion body myopathies. Although clinically distinct from sporadic IBM, preclinical models of hereditary inclusion body myopathy have offered an opportunity to move some therapies toward clinical development.                                         SUMMARY               Patients with sporadic IBM experience significant morbidity, and the disease is associated with a large unmet medical need. As therapies are developed, improved diagnosis will be essential. Early diagnosis relies on awareness, clinical history, physical examination, laboratory features, and appropriate muscle biopsy processing. Future research is needed to understand the natural history, identify genetic risk factors, and validate biomarkers to track disease progression. These steps are essential as we move toward therapeutic interventions.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms have been increasingly recognized in PD and DLB, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment strategies. While PD is most associated with and diagnosed by the presence of motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms can often be the most debilitating for patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent nonmotor features and include cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, psychosis, impulse control disorders, and apathy. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can be difficult to recognize and diagnose in patients with PD, in part because of comorbidity and symptom overlap with core PD features. Treatment strategies are a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions used in the general population and those specific to PD. DLB is a clinical dementia syndrome, often with similar cognitive, behavioral, autonomic, and motor features as PD. Moreover, DLB has shared underlying pathophysiology with PD, as both are associated with postmortem findings of {$\alpha$}-synuclein neuropathology at autopsy and have shared genetic risk and prodromal symptoms. DLB is clinically differentiated from PD by the presenting features of cognitive impairment in DLB, compared with the variable onset of cognitive impairment occurring 1 year or more after established motor onset in PD. Thus, diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB are similar to that of PD and have important implications for maintaining patient independence and providing support for caregivers because motor, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric symptoms have an additive effect on patient functional disability.                                         SUMMARY               A careful history and physical examination are often needed to accurately diagnose and treat the heterogeneous cognitive and behavioral symptoms of PD and DLB. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in PD and DLB are important, as these are a considerable source of patient disability and caregiver burden.},

Referral questions, principles of evaluation, and common instruments to detect abnormalities in cognition and behavior in this population are reviewed. The integration of neuropsychological test findings with other clinical and biomarker information enhances early detection, differential diagnosis, and care planning.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, and, accordingly, the prevalence and incidence of dementia associated with age-related neurodegenerative brain disease are rising. Age is the greatest risk factor for the dementia associated with Alzheimer disease, the most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia in people over 65 years of age; other etiologies, such as the class of frontotemporal lobar degenerations, are increasingly recognized in individuals both younger and older than 65 years of age. The clinical dementia diagnosis, unfortunately, is imperfectly related to disease etiology; however, probabilistic relationships can aid in diagnosis. Further, mounting evidence from postmortem brain autopsies points to multiple etiologies. The case examples in this article illustrate how the neuropsychological evaluation increases diagnostic accuracy and, most important, identifies salient cognitive and behavioral symptoms to target for nonpharmacologic intervention and caregiver education and support. Sharing the diagnosis with affected individuals is also discussed with reference to prognosis and severity of illness.

  abstract = {Study Design Prospective cohort. Background The high risk of second anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries after return to sport highlights the importance of return-to-sport decision making. Objective return-to-sport criteria frequently use limb symmetry indexes (LSIs) to quantify quadriceps strength and hop scores. Whether using the uninvolved limb in LSIs is optimal is unknown. Objectives To evaluate the uninvolved limb as a reference standard for LSIs utilized in return-to-sport testing and its relationship with second ACL injury rates. Methods Seventy athletes completed quadriceps strength and 4 single-leg hop tests before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and 6 months after ACLR. Limb symmetry indexes for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures at 6 months. Estimated preinjury capacity (EPIC) levels for each test compared involved-limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved-limb measures before ACLR. Second ACL injuries were tracked for a minimum follow-up of 2 years after ACLR. Results Forty (57.1\%) patients achieved 90\% LSIs for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Only 20 (28.6\%) patients met 90\% EPIC levels (comparing the involved limb at 6 months after ACLR to the uninvolved limb before ACLR) for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Twenty-four (34.3\%) patients who achieved 90\% LSIs for all measures 6 months after ACLR did not achieve 90\% EPIC levels for all measures. Estimated preinjury capacity levels were more sensitive than LSIs in predicting second ACL injuries (LSIs, 0.273; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.010, 0.566 and EPIC, 0.818; 95\% CI: 0.523, 0.949). Conclusion Limb symmetry indexes frequently overestimate knee function after ACLR and may be related to second ACL injury risk. These findings raise concern about whether the variable ACL return-to-sport criteria utilized in current clinical practice are stringent enough to achieve safe and successful return to sport.

This study examines the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale when applied to persons with neck dysfunction. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale and Neck Disability Index were applied at the initial visit, within 72 hours of the initial visit, and following 1-4 weeks of treatment in 31 patients with cervical dysfunction. At the time of the initial visit, the clinician made an estimate of patients' prognoses on a five-point scale. This estimate served as an priori construct for change: patients with better ratings would change more. The results demonstrate excellent reliability (R = .92) validity (r = .73-.83 compared with the Neck Disability Index, and r = .52-.64 compared with the prognosis rating), and sensitivity of change (r = .79-.83 compared with Neck Disability Index change scores, and r = .46-.53 compared with the prognosis rating). No difference was found between the Patient-Specific Functional Scale and Neck Disability Index in their ability to detect change over time. The results of this study are consistent with previous investigations which have concluded that the Patient-Specific Functional Scale is an efficient and valid measure for assessing disability and change in disability in persons with low back pain and knee dysfunction.},

This review was performed to identify the scores most commonly used and to evaluate them according to the 4 core domains of shoulder trials (according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [COMET] initiative) and their respective psychometric qualities. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature of 3 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed) was undertaken. Studies were identified using eligibility criteria and critically appraised by 2 authors. Data were extracted using an a priori template. Outcome scores were identified and assessed regarding COMET domain inclusion and their psychometric properties. RESULTS: The most frequently used scores were the Rowe (58\%), Constant (33\%), Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI; 24\%), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (23\%) scores. The majority of outcome scores assessed pain and all assessed physical functioning. Quality of life and a global assessment of treatment success were rarely incorporated. No single outcome score considered all core COMET domains. The WOSI was the most acceptable measure of those assessed with respect to its validity, reliability, and responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The WOSI incorporated 3 of the 4 core domains for shoulder trials (pain, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life). It had the most psychometric testing of the identified scores, confirming its reliability, validity, and responsiveness in the setting of shoulder instability. We recommend its use in this setting; however, it should be supplemented with additional outcome scores, such as the University of California-Los Angeles score, to cover all of the core COMET domains.},

This article defines and describes LGMDs, delineates a diagnostic strategy, and discusses treatment of the LGMDs.                                         recent findings               In 2018, the definition of the LGMDs was further refined, and a new nomenclature was proposed. Diagnosis of the LGMDs was long guided by the distinctive clinical characteristics of each particular subtype but now integrates use of genetics---with next-generation sequencing panels, exomes, and full genome analysis---early in the diagnostic assessment. Appreciation of the phenotypic diversity of each LGMD subtype continues to expand. This emphasizes the need for precision genetic diagnostics to better understand each subtype and formulate appropriate management for individual patients. Of significant relevance, the explosion of research into therapeutic options accentuates the need for accurate diagnosis, comprehensive disease characterization, and description of the natural histories of the LGMDs to move the field forward and to mitigate disease impact on patients with LGMD.                                         summary               The LGMDs are genetic muscle diseases that superficially appear similar to one another but have important differences in rates of progression and concomitant comorbidities. Definitive diagnoses are crucial to guide management and treatment now and in the future. As targeted treatments emerge, it will be important for clinicians to understand the nomenclature, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of the LGMDs.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed, accounting for over 200,000 cases annually. Despite the high prevalence, there is still much debate as to the optimal graft choice. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current literature and discuss the reported outcomes for the most common graft choices. RECENT FINDINGS: The most common autografts being used include bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB), hamstring tendon (HT), and quadriceps tendon (QT). Hamstring tendon might have a slightly higher re-tear rate when compared with BPTB (2.84 versus 2.80). However, BPTB has a higher rate of anterior knee and kneeling pain in the short- and mid-term follow-up. This has not been shown to be the case in long-term follow-up. Allograft is a viable option for revisions and primaries in patients greater than 35~years old; however, re-tear rate increases significantly in younger patients. ACL reconstruction graft choice is a highly studied and yet still exceedingly debated topic. Most large studies report either no significant difference or a small difference in failure rate and outcome scores between the different autograft choices. Allografts have been demonstrated to have an increased risk of failure in younger athletes and should be reserved for revision cases and those aged 35~years and older. Graft choice should ultimately be decided upon based on surgeon comfort and experience and individual patient characteristics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this overview, new and existent material on the organization and composition of the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) will be evaluated in respect to its anatomy, innervation biomechanics and clinical relevance. The integration of the passive connective tissues of the TLF and active muscular structures surrounding this structure are discussed, and the relevance of their mutual interactions in relation to low back and pelvic pain reviewed. The TLF is a girdling structure consisting of several aponeurotic and fascial layers that separates the paraspinal muscles from the muscles of the posterior abdominal wall. The superficial lamina of the posterior layer of the TLF (PLF) is dominated by the aponeuroses of the latissimus dorsi and the serratus posterior inferior. The deeper lamina of the PLF forms an encapsulating retinacular sheath around the paraspinal muscles. The middle layer of the TLF (MLF) appears to derive from an intermuscular septum that developmentally separates the epaxial from the hypaxial musculature. This septum forms during the fifth and sixth weeks of gestation. The paraspinal retinacular sheath (PRS) is in a key position to act as a `hydraulic amplifier', assisting the paraspinal muscles in supporting the lumbosacral spine. This sheath forms a lumbar interfascial triangle (LIFT) with the MLF and PLF. Along the lateral border of the PRS, a raphe forms where the sheath meets the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis. This lateral raphe is a thickened complex of dense connective tissue marked by the presence of the LIFT, and represents the junction of the hypaxial myofascial compartment (the abdominal muscles) with the paraspinal sheath of the epaxial muscles. The lateral raphe is in a position to distribute tension from the surrounding hypaxial and extremity muscles into the layers of the TLF. At the base of the lumbar spine all of the layers of the TLF fuse together into a thick composite that attaches firmly to the posterior superior iliac spine and the sacrotuberous ligament. This thoracolumbar composite (TLC) is in a position to assist in maintaining the integrity of the lower lumbar spine and the sacroiliac joint. The three-dimensional structure of the TLF and its caudally positioned composite will be analyzed in light of recent studies concerning the cellular organization of fascia, as well as its innervation. Finally, the concept of a TLC will be used to reassess biomechanical models of lumbopelvic stability, static posture and movement.},

Epidemiologic and neurobiological data are reviewed as well as common associated symptoms, including sleep disruption, and treatment approaches to these conditions.                                         RECENT FINDINGS                                PTSD is no longer considered an anxiety-related disorder in the                 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition                 classification and instead is associated with trauma/stressor-related disorders. PTSD symptoms are clustered into four domains including intrusive experiences, avoidance, mood, and arousal symptoms. Despite this reclassification, similarities exist in consideration of diagnosis, treatment, and comorbidities with anxiety disorders. PTSD and anxiety-related disorders are heterogeneous, which is reflected by the neural circuits involved in the genesis of symptoms that may vary across symptom domains. Treatment is likely to benefit from consideration of this heterogeneity.                              Research in animal models of fear and anxiety, as well as in humans, suggests that patients with PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder have difficulty accurately determining safety from danger and struggle to suppress fear in the presence of safety cues.               Empirically supported psychotherapies commonly involved exposure (fear extinction learning) and are recommended for PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been shown to be effective in other anxiety-related disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly used in the treatment of PTSD and anxiety disorders in which pharmacologic intervention is supported. Treating sleep disruption including sleep apnea (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]), nightmares, and insomnia (preferably via psychotherapy) may improve symptoms of PTSD, as well as improve mood in anxiety disorders.                                         SUMMARY               PTSD has a lifetime prevalence that is close to 10\% and shares neurobiological features with anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental conditions and are highly comorbid with other disorders; treatment considerations typically include cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacologic intervention. Developing technologies show some promise as treatment alternatives in the future.},

RECENT FINDINGS               The discovery of several neural autoantibodies and their antigenic targets has revolutionized the investigation and treatment of immune-mediated myelopathies. Detection of these serologic biomarkers can support or establish a diagnosis of an autoimmune myelopathy, and, in the case of paraneoplastic syndromes, indicate the likely presence of an underlying malignancy. Distinctive lesion patterns detected on spinal cord or brain MRI narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with acute or subacute inflammatory myelopathies, including those not associated with autoantibody markers.                                         SUMMARY               Immune-mediated myelopathies usually present acutely or subacutely and have a broad differential diagnosis. A systematic diagnostic approach using data from the clinical setting and presentation, MRI lesion patterns, CSF data, and autoantibody markers can differentiate these disorders from noninflammatory myelopathies, often with precise disease classification. This, in turn, provides prognostic information, especially whether the disorder is likely to relapse, and facilitates therapeutic decision making. Diagnostic accuracy informs selection of acute immunotherapy aimed at arresting and reversing recent neurologic injury and, when necessary, selection of long-term treatment for prevention of disease progression or relapse.},

Practical treatment strategies are applied to common behavioral symptoms.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Aggressive and agitated behavior is common in dementia. Behavioral symptoms lead to reduced quality of life and distress for both patients and caregivers. They can also lead to poor outcomes and are associated with significant financial implications for the individual and health care system. A wide range of difficult behaviors exists, with limited evidence for deciding on treatment. Clinicians should integrate the available evidence with practical and commonsense strategies to target these difficult-to-treat behaviors.                                         SUMMARY               Treating aggression and agitation in dementia is challenging. Viewing behaviors as a response to either internal or external stimuli can help guide treatment. Treatment should emphasize nonpharmacologic approaches as an initial step, using practical and commonsense strategies. Caregivers and family should be actively involved in the planning and implementation of behavioral plans. It is essential to minimize both medical and nonmedical factors that may be contributing to behaviors. When pharmacologic options are required, it is important to choose medications that will target specific behavioral goals, having both practical consideration and the best evidence in mind.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a 2-week multisite program of CIMT vs usual and customary care on improvement in upper extremity function among patients who had a first stroke within the previous 3 to 9 months. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Extremity Constraint Induced Therapy Evaluation (EXCITE) trial, a prospective, single-blind, randomized, multisite clinical trial conducted at 7 US academic institutions between January 2001 and January 2003. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-two individuals with predominantly ischemic stroke. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned to receive either CIMT (n = 106; wearing a restraining mitt on the less-affected hand while engaging in repetitive task practice and behavioral shaping with the hemiplegic hand) or usual and customary care (n = 116; ranging from no treatment after concluding formal rehabilitation to pharmacologic or physiotherapeutic interventions); patients were stratified by sex, prestroke dominant side, side of stroke, and level of paretic arm function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), a measure of laboratory time and strength-based ability and quality of movement (functional ability), and the Motor Activity Log (MAL), a measure of how well and how often 30 common daily activities are performed. RESULTS: From baseline to 12 months, the CIMT group showed greater improvements than the control group in both the WMFT Performance Time (decrease in mean time from 19.3 seconds to 9.3 seconds [52\% reduction] vs from 24.0 seconds to 17.7 seconds [26\% reduction]; between-group difference, 34\% [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 12\%-51\%]; P{$<$}.001) and in the MAL Amount of Use (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.21 to 2.13 vs from 1.15 to 1.65; between-group difference, 0.43 [95\% CI, 0.05-0.80]; P{$<$}.001) and MAL Quality of Movement (on a 0-5 scale, increase from 1.26 to 2.23 vs 1.18 to 1.66; between-group difference, 0.48 [95\% CI, 0.13-0.84]; P{$<$}.001). The CIMT group achieved a decrease of 19.5 in self-perceived hand function difficulty (Stroke Impact Scale hand domain) vs a decrease of 10.1 for the control group (between-group difference, 9.42 [95\% CI, 0.27-18.57]; P=.05).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons. Due to its rarity and rapidly progressive nature, studying the epidemiology of ALS is challenging, and a comprehensive picture of the global burden of this disease is lacking. The objective of this systematic review was to describe the global incidence and prevalence of ALS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL to identify articles published between January 1, 2010, and May 6, 2021. Studies that were population based and reported estimates of prevalence, incidence, and/or mortality of ALS were eligible for inclusion. This study focuses on the incidence and prevalence. Quality assessment was performed using a tool developed to evaluate methodology relevant to prevalence and incidence studies. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021250559. RESULTS: This search generated 6,238 articles, of which 140 were selected for data extraction and quality assessment. Of these, 85 articles reported on the incidence and 61 on the prevalence of ALS. Incidence ranged from 0.26 per 100,000 person-years in Ecuador to 23.46 per 100,000 person-years in Japan. Point prevalence ranged from 1.57 per 100,000 in Iran to 11.80 per 100,000 in the United States. Many articles identified cases with ALS from multiple data sources. DISCUSSION: There is variation in reported incidence and prevalence estimates of ALS across the world. While registries are an important and powerful tool to quantify disease burden, such resources are not available everywhere. This results in gaps in reporting of the global epidemiology of ALS, as highlighted by the degree of variation (and quality) in estimates of incidence and prevalence reported in this review.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Determining the correct diagnosis can be challenging in patients presenting with hip pain. The physical examination is an essential tool that can aid in diagnosis of hip pathology. The purpose of this review is to provide an updated summary of recent literature on the physical exam of the hip, particularly as it relates to diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome, labral injury, and hip microinstability. RECENT FINDINGS: Physical exam findings consistent with the diagnosis of FAI include reduced supine hip internal rotation and positive flexion-adduction-internal rotation maneuvers. Labral tears can be detected on exam with the Scour test. Studies demonstrate altered hip biomechanics in patients with FAI during activities such as walking and squatting. Those with FAI have slower squat velocities, slower sit-to-stand tests, and increased hip flexion moments during ambulation. Hip microinstability is a dynamic process, which can occur after prior hip arthroscopy. For hip microinstability, the combination of the three following positive tests (anterior apprehension, abduction-extension-external rotation, and prone external rotation) is associated with a 95\% likelihood of microinstability as confirmed by examination under anesthesia at the time of surgery. A comprehensive hip physical exam involves evaluation of the hip in multiple positions and assessing hip range of motion, strength, as well as performing provocative testing. A combination of physical exam maneuvers is necessary to accurately diagnose FAI syndrome and labral pathology as individual tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity. While an elevated level of suspicion is needed to diagnose hip microinstability, the provocative tests for microinstability are highly specific.},

These five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. Of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. Consumption of 30~g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological,~muscular, cartilage,~neurological, and cardiovascular health. The present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). Dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. Furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system. Red meat (including beef) is a functional food for optimizing human growth, development and health.},

  abstract = {Spine Anatomy Collectively, the spine has an anterior and a posterior region (see Image. Lumbar Vertebral Anatomy). The cylindrical vertebral bodies comprise the anterior spine, separated by intervertebral (IV) disks and held in place by the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. The IV disks have the gelatinous nucleus pulposus in the middle, surrounded by the cartilaginous annulus fibrosus (see Image. Intervertebral Disk). The cervical and lumbar spinal segments have the largest IV disks, owing to these regions' mobility. The anterior spine is a shock absorber of bodily movements. The vertebral arches and processes constitute the posterior spine. Each vertebral arch has an anterior pair of cylindrical pedicles and a posterior pair of laminae (see Image. Lumbar Vertebra, Superoposterior View). Other structures emanating from the vertebral arch include 2 lateral transverse processes, 1 posterior process, and 2 superior and 2 inferior articular facets. Facet joints form from superior and inferior facet apposition. The spinal canal, which houses the spinal cord, is formed by the vertebral bodies and IV disks anteriorly and vertebral arches posteriorly. The nerve roots exit superior to their corresponding vertebral body through the intervertebral canal. The ligamentum flavum (yellow ligament) is a thick, fibrous structure passing between adjacent laminae. The lateral recess is an anatomic space in the posterior spine bounded anteriorly by the vertebral body and disk, posteriorly by the ligamentum flavum and vertebral arch, laterally by the pedicle, and medially by the thecal sac. This region is narrow and is a potential area of nerve root compression. The posterior spine has various functions, including spinal cord and nerve root protection and muscle and ligament support.~~ Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the narrowing of the lumbar vertebra in the central canal, lateral recess, or neural foraminal areas.~Central canal stenosis may compress the thecal sac and bilateral spinal segments and thus, in the severe form, may produce bilateral symptoms. Lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis may compress the nerve roots and produce unilateral lumbar radiculopathy symptoms.~ Central stenosis arises from anterior ligamentum flavum hypertrophy compounded by posterior disk bulging. This condition is more prevalent at the L4 to L5 level than other spinal segments. Meanwhile, lateral recess stenosis results from facet arthropathy and osteophyte formation, compressing the nerve before it passes the intervertebral foramen. Foraminal stenosis is due to disk height loss, foraminal disk protrusion, or osteophyte formation. These changes impinge on the nerve root inside the intervertebral foramen. Extraforaminal stenosis is usually due to far lateral disk herniation. This condition compresses the nerve root after exiting the intervertebral foramen laterally.~ LSS is a significant cause of disability in older individuals and a common spinal surgery indication in patients older than 65 years.~Henk Verbiest first described relative and absolute spinal stenosis as lumbar canal midsagittal diameter of less than 12 mm and 10 mm, respectively. However, LSS clinical and radiologic diagnostic criteria have not been established despite this condition's global prevalence. Thus, this clinical entity has no universally accepted definition.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Neoplastic myelopathies are uncommon neurologic disorders but cause significant morbidity when they occur. Primary spinal cord tumors can be classified into intramedullary, intradural extramedullary, or extradural tumors. Diffuse gliomas and ependymal tumors are the most common intramedullary tumors. Diffuse gliomas include the World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III astrocytomas, the grade II and grade III oligodendrogliomas, the grade IV glioblastomas, and newly recognized pediatric diffuse midline gliomas with H3 K27M mutation. The majority of diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas are                 IDH                 -mutant tumors, whereas only 10\% of glioblastomas are                 IDH                 -mutant. Oligodendrogliomas are typically                 IDH                 -mutant and are characterized by the molecular signature of 1p/19q codeletion. Nine distinct molecular subgroups of ependymomas have been identified based on their genetic features and location.                 NF2                 mutations are frequently found in spinal cord ependymomas. Metastatic tumors are the most common tumors of the spine and can be extradural, leptomeningeal, or, rarely, intramedullary. Extradural metastatic spinal cord compression is a neurologic emergency and should be promptly diagnosed as pretreatment neurologic status dictates the posttreatment outcome.                                                        SUMMARY               Neoplastic myelopathies encompass many diagnoses ranging from benign and malignant spinal tumors to paraneoplastic syndromes heralding cancers. The knowledge of the clinical features and management of neoplastic myelopathies is essential to practicing neurologists as early diagnosis and treatment can prevent devastating neurologic sequelae.},

  abstract = {The two functional bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), namely, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles, must work in concert to control displacement of the tibia relative to the femur for complex motions. Thus, the replacement graft(s) for a torn ACL should possess similar tension patterns. The objective of the study was to examine whether a double-bundle ACL reconstruction with the semitendinosus-gracilis autografts could replicate the tension patterns of those for the intact ACL under controlled in vitro loading conditions. By means of a robotic/universal force moment sensor (UFS) testing system, the in situ force vectors (both magnitude and direction) for the AM and PL bundles of the ACL, as well as their respective replacement grafts, were determined and compared on nine human cadaveric knees. It was found that double-bundle ACL reconstruction could closely replicate the in situ force vectors. Under a 134-N anterior tibial load, the resultant force vectors for the intact ACL and the reconstructed ACL had a difference of 5 to 11 N (p {$>$} 0.05) in magnitude and 1 to 13 degrees (p {$>$} 0.05) in direction. Whereas, under combined rotatory loads of 10-N-m valgus and 5-N-m internal tibial torques, the corresponding differences were 10 to 16 N and 4 degrees to 11 degrees, respectively. Again, there were no statistically significant differences except at 30 degrees of flexion where the force vector for the AM graft had a 15 degrees (p {$<$} 0.05) lower elevation angle than did the AM bundle.},

These adaptive morphologic changes are thought to be independently protective against shoulder injury; however, their relationship to each other is poorly understood. PURPOSE: To determine if an association exists between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders of professional pitchers. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The HRT and GRV measurements were determined using published techniques in asymptomatic bilateral shoulders of 32 professional pitchers (mean age, 23 years). Three measurements for each variable were averaged, and the reliability of the techniques was verified. The relationship between HRT and GRV within the same shoulders was determined with Pearson correlation coefficients. Paired t tests were used to compare HRT and GRV between the throwing and nonthrowing shoulder. Simple ratios were calculated between HRT and GRV. RESULTS: Humeral retrotorsion and GRV were both significantly greater on the throwing side compared with the nonthrowing side (HRT: throwing = 9.0{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 11.4{$^\circ$} and nonthrowing = 22.1{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 10.7{$^\circ$}, P {$<$} .001; GRV: throwing = 8.6{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 6.0{$^\circ$} and nonthrowing = 4.9{$^\circ$} {\textpm} 4.8{$^\circ$}, P = .001). Within the same shoulders, there was a statistically significant positive association between HRT and GRV on the throwing side (r = 0.43, P = .016) but not on the nonthrowing side (r = -0.13, P = .50). The HRT:GRV ratio was 2.3:1 for throwing shoulders and 7:1 for nonthrowing shoulders. CONCLUSION: The concurrent increases in dominant shoulder HRT and GRV were observed as a 2:1 "thrower's ratio." As this relationship was not observed on the nondominant shoulder, it suggests that bony adaptation of the proximal humerus and glenoid are coupled during skeletal development in the throwing shoulder. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Cold water immersion (CWI) is very popular as a method reducing post-exercise muscle stiffness, eliminating fatigue, decreasing exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), and recovering sports performance. However, there are conflicting opinions as to whether CWI functions positively or negatively. The mechanisms of CWI are still not clear. In this systematic review, we used meta-analysis aims to examine the effect of CWI on fatigue recovery after high-intensity exercise and exercise performance. A total of 20 studies were retrieved and included from PubMed, PEDro and Elsevier databases in this review. Publication years of articles ranged from 2002 to 2022. In selected studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Crossover design (COD). Analyses of subjective indicators such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and objective indicators such as countermovement jump (CMJ) and blood plasma markers including creatine kinase(CK), lactate/lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), C-reactive protein(CRP), and IL-6 were performed. Pooled data showed as follows: CWI resulted in a significant decline in subjective characteristics (delayed-onset muscle soreness and perceived exertion at 0~h); CWI reduced countermovement jump(CMJ) significantly at 0 h, creatine kinase(CK) was lowered at 24 h, and lactate at 24 and 48~h. There was no evidence that CWI affects C-reactive protein(CRP) and IL-6 during a 48-h recovery period. Subgroup analysis revealed that different CWI sites and water temperatures have no effect on post-exercise fatigue recovery. Recommended athletes immersed in cold water immediately after exercise, which can effectively reduce muscle soreness and accelerate fatigue recovery.},

The reason for such separation remains unknown. We found that evolutionarily SOC appears in animals conquering the land - amniotes. Analysis of the ossification pattern in mammals with specialized extremities (whales, bats, jerboa) revealed that SOC development correlates with the extent of mechanical loads. Mathematical modeling revealed that SOC reduces mechanical stress within the growth plate. Functional experiments revealed the high vulnerability of hypertrophic chondrocytes to mechanical stress and showed that SOC protects these cells from apoptosis caused by extensive loading. Atomic force microscopy showed that hypertrophic chondrocytes are the least mechanically stiff cells within the growth plate. Altogether, these findings suggest that SOC has evolved to protect the hypertrophic chondrocytes from the high mechanical stress encountered in the terrestrial environment.},

Prompt diagnosis of the underlying mechanism may improve secondary prevention strategies. This article reviews recent randomized trials, observational studies, case reports, and guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of cardioembolic stroke.                                         LATEST DEVELOPMENTS               Several pathologies can lead to cardioembolic stroke, including atrial fibrillation, aortic arch atheroma, patent foramen ovale, left ventricular dysfunction, and many others. Secondary stroke prevention strategies differ across these heterogeneous mechanisms. In addition to medical treatment advances such as the use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, surgical treatments such as closure of patent foramen ovale have been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in select patients. Furthermore, left atrial appendage occlusion is a promising strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation who are candidates for short-term oral anticoagulation therapy but not long-term oral anticoagulation therapy.                                         ESSENTIAL POINTS               A thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential to determine cardioembolic causes of stroke. In addition to risk factor management and lifestyle modifications, identification and targeting of the underlying cardioembolic stroke mechanisms will lead to improved stroke prevention strategies in patients with cardioembolic stroke.},

References of important articles were searched manually for relevant studies. Articles were eligible for the meta-analysis if they were high-quality RCTs and reported data on stool frequency, stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and gastrointestinal symptoms. The data were extracted independently by two researchers (Yang J and Wang HP) according to the described selection criteria. Review manager version 5 software was used for analysis and test. Weighted mean difference with 95\%CI was used for quantitative data, odds ratio (OR) with 95\%CI was used for dichotomous data. Both I(2) statistic with a cut-off of {$\geq$} 50\% and the {$\chi$}(2) test with a P value {$<$} 0.10 were used to define a significant degree of heterogeneity. RESULTS: We searched 1322 potential relevant articles, 19 of which were retrieved for further assessment, 14 studies were excluded for various reasons, five studies were included in the analysis. Dietary fiber showed significant advantage over placebo in stool frequency (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05). There was no significant difference in stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation between the two groups. Stool frequency were reported by five RCTs, all results showed either a trend or a significant difference in favor of the treatment group, number of stools per week increased in treatment group than in placebo group (OR = 1.19; 95\%CI: 0.58-1.80, P {$<$} 0.05), with no significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2)= 0, P = 0.77). Four studies evaluated stool consistency, one of them presented outcome in terms of percentage of hard stool, which was different from others, so we included the other three studies for analysis. Two studies reported treatment success. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P {$<$} 0.1, I(2) {$>$} 50\%). Three studies reported laxative use, quantitative data was shown in one study, and the pooled analysis of the other two studies showed no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups in laxative use (OR = 1.07; 95\%CI 0.51-2.25), and no heterogeneity was found (P = 0.84, I(2)= 0). Three studies evaluated painful defecation: one study presented both quantitative and dichotomous data, the other two studies reported quantitative and dichotomous data separately. We used dichotomous data for analysis. CONCLUSION: Dietary fiber intake can obviously increase stool frequency in patients with constipation. It does not obviously improve stool consistency, treatment success, laxative use and painful defecation.},

We analyzed the images and set a quadrant-linked hand surface. Subsequently, we measured the lengths of both axes and the coordinates of the branch locations in the quadrant. The surface locations of branches that innervated the lumbricals and interossei were clearly quantified. The branches of dUN exhibited a 4-group distribution pattern.

Treating acid-base disorders in greater detail facilitates pathophysiologic understanding and improved therapeutic planning. Understanding the ratiometric relationship between the lungs, which excrete volatile acid as carbon dioxide, and the kidneys, which contribute to maintenance of plasma bicarbonate, allows precise identification of the dominant acid-base disturbance when more than a simple disorder is present and aids in executing a measured treatment response. Concordantly, mapping paired values of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and the bicarbonate concentration ([HCO3 -]) on a Cartesian coordinate system visually defines an acid-base disorder and validates the ratiometric methodology. We review and demonstrate the algebraic and logarithmic methods of arterial blood gas analysis through the example of a complex acid-base disorder, emphasizing examination of the PCO2-to-[HCO3 -] ratio.},

The association between Fe deficiency without anaemia (IDNA) and fatigue is unclear. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effect of Fe on fatigue in patients with IDNA and the association between IDNA and fatigue in the population. Articles from the PubMed database up to 19 January 2016 were systematically searched. A total of six relevant randomised controlled trials (RCT) and six relevant cross-sectional studies were identified. All outcomes were converted into effect sizes. In the meta-analysis of the six RCT, we identified a significant therapeutic effect of Fe in fatigue patients with IDNA (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}33; 95 \% CI 0{$\cdot$}17, 0{$\cdot$}48; I 2=0{$\cdot$}0 \%; P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. significant association) were robust. In the meta-analysis of the six cross-sectional studies, the association between IDNA and fatigue was not significant (pooled effect size 0{$\cdot$}10; 95 \% CI -0{$\cdot$}11, 0{$\cdot$}31; I 2=57{$\cdot$}4 \%; P=0{$\cdot$}362). A sensitivity analysis found that the overall results (i.e. no significant association) were not robust; removal of one study made the outcomes significant. These meta-analyses suggest that improving Fe status may decrease fatigue. Further research is necessary to identify diagnostic criteria for selecting fatigue patients who might benefit from Fe therapy and to assess the prevalence of IDNA with fatigue in the general population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data reported during the past 5 years indicate that rates of survival have increased among infants born at the borderline of viability, but less is known about how increased rates of survival among these infants relate to early childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHODS: We compared survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes among infants born at 22 to 24 weeks of gestation, as assessed at 18 to 22 months of corrected age, across three consecutive birth-year epochs (2000-2003 [epoch 1], 2004-2007 [epoch 2], and 2008-2011 [epoch 3]). The infants were born at 11 centers that participated in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. The primary outcome measure was a three-level outcome - survival without neurodevelopmental impairment, survival with neurodevelopmental impairment, or death. After accounting for differences in infant characteristics, including birth center, we used multinomial generalized logit models to compare the relative risk of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment, survival with neurodevelopmental impairment, and death. RESULTS: Data on the primary outcome were available for 4274 of 4458 infants (96\%) born at the 11 centers. The percentage of infants who survived increased from 30\% (424 of 1391 infants) in epoch 1 to 36\% (487 of 1348 infants) in epoch 3 (P{$<$}0.001). The percentage of infants who survived without neurodevelopmental impairment increased from 16\% (217 of 1391) in epoch 1 to 20\% (276 of 1348) in epoch 3 (P=0.001), whereas the percentage of infants who survived with neurodevelopmental impairment did not change significantly (15\% [207 of 1391] in epoch 1 and 16\% [211 of 1348] in epoch 3, P=0.29). After adjustment for changes in the baseline characteristics of the infants over time, both the rate of survival with neurodevelopmental impairment (as compared with death) and the rate of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment (as compared with death) increased over time (adjusted relative risks, 1.27 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 1.01 to 1.59] and 1.59 [95\% CI, 1.28 to 1.99], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment increased between 2000 and 2011 in this large cohort of periviable infants.

AIM: We examined the association between meat intake and life expectancy at a population level based on ecological data published by the United Nations agencies. METHODS: Population-specific data were obtained from 175 countries/territories. Scatter plots, bivariate, partial correlation and linear regression models were used with SPSS 25 to explore and compare the correlations between newborn life expectancy (e(0)), life expectancy at 5 years of life (e(5)) and intakes of meat, and carbohydrate crops, respectively. The established risk factors to life expectancy - caloric intake, urbanization, obesity and education levels - were included as the potential confounders. RESULTS: Worldwide, bivariate correlation analyses revealed that meat intake is positively correlated with life expectancies. This relationship remained significant when influences of caloric intake, urbanization, obesity, education and carbohydrate crops were statistically controlled. Stepwise linear regression selected meat intake, not carbohydrate crops, as one of the significant predictors of life expectancy. In contrast, carbohydrate crops showed weak and negative correlation with life expectancy. CONCLUSION: If meat intake is not incorporated into nutrition science for predicting human life expectancy, results could prove inaccurate.},

RECENT FINDINGS               Although certain clinical features suggest a vascular etiology in acute and chronic myelopathy settings, accurate MRI interpretation within the clinical context is key. Recent studies have shown vascular myelopathies are frequently misdiagnosed as transverse myelitis, and recognition of this diagnostic pitfall is important. Many different vascular mechanisms can cause myelopathy; this article provides a comprehensive review that simplifies disease categories into arterial ischemia, venous congestion/ischemia, hematomyelia, and extraparenchymal hemorrhage.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliability of measurements is a prerequisite of medical research. For nominal data, Fleiss' kappa (in the following labelled as Fleiss' K) and Krippendorff's alpha provide the highest flexibility of the available reliability measures with respect to number of raters and categories. Our aim was to investigate which measures and which confidence intervals provide the best statistical properties for the assessment of inter-rater reliability in different situations. METHODS: We performed a large simulation study to investigate the precision of the estimates for Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha and to determine the empirical coverage probability of the corresponding confidence intervals (asymptotic for Fleiss' K and bootstrap for both measures). Furthermore, we compared measures and confidence intervals in a real world case study. RESULTS: Point estimates of Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha did not differ from each other in all scenarios. In the case of missing data (completely at random), Krippendorff's alpha provided stable estimates, while the complete case analysis approach for Fleiss' K led to biased estimates. For shifted null hypotheses, the coverage probability of the asymptotic confidence interval for Fleiss' K was low, while the bootstrap confidence intervals for both measures provided a coverage probability close to the theoretical one. CONCLUSIONS: Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha with bootstrap confidence intervals are equally suitable for the analysis of reliability of complete nominal data. The asymptotic confidence interval for Fleiss' K should not be used. In the case of missing data or data or higher than nominal order, Krippendorff's alpha is recommended. Together with this article, we provide an R-script for calculating Fleiss' K and Krippendorff's alpha and their corresponding bootstrap confidence intervals.},

  abstract = {Choline was officially recognized as an essential nutrient by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1998. There is significant variation in the dietary requirement for choline that can be explained by common genetic polymorphisms. Because of its wide-ranging roles in human metabolism, from cell structure to neurotransmitter synthesis, choline-deficiency is now thought to have an impact on diseases such as liver disease, atherosclerosis, and, possibly, neurological disorders. Choline is found in a wide variety of foods. Eggs and meats are rich sources of choline in the North American diet, providing up to 430 milligrams per 100 grams. Mean choline intakes for older children, men, women, and pregnant women are far below the adequate intake level established by the IOM. Given the importance of choline in a wide range of critical functions in the human body, coupled with less-than-optimal intakes among the population, dietary guidance should be developed to encourage the intake of choline-rich foods.},

Important advances in the treatment, etiology, and the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease have been made in the past 50 years. This article provides a review of the current understanding of Parkinson disease, including the epidemiology, phenomenology, and treatment options of the disease.                                         RECENT FINDINGS               Parkinson disease is now recognized to be a heterogeneous condition marked by both motor and nonmotor symptoms. It is composed of preclinical, prodromal, and clinical phases. New medications with improved ease of administration have been approved for its treatment. Innovative surgical therapies for Parkinson disease may be used when motor symptoms persist despite optimal medical management.                                         SUMMARY               Parkinson disease is a complex, heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. Considerable progress has been made in its treatment modalities, both pharmacologic and surgical. While its cure remains elusive, exciting new research advances are on the horizon.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal organ meat (offal) is a food with high nutrient density that is popular in different parts of the world, but its relationship with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unclear. We aimed to examine whether daily animal organ meat consumption is associated with the presence of NASH in individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). METHODS: A total of 136 Chinese adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included. Definite NASH was defined as NAFLD activity score {$\geq$}4 and at least one point for steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation. Daily animal organ meat consumption was estimated using a self-administered validated food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between animal organ meat intake and liver disease severity. RESULTS: The 136 participants (80.9\% men) of the study had a mean {\textpm} standard deviation (SD) age of 39.0{\textpm}12.5 years and body mass index of 27.4{\textpm}3.6 kg/m2. Prevalence of definite NASH was 65.4\%. Daily median organ meat consumption was 1.30 g/1,000 kcal. Animal organ meat consumption was inversely associated with the presence of NASH even after adjustment of demographics, lifestyle variables, metabolic and dietary factors, as well as liver fibrosis stage; adjusted-odds ratios (95\% confidence intervals) for NASH were 0.15 (0.03, 0.69) for the highest tertile and 0.18 (0.05, 0.70) for the medium tertile, compared to the lowest (reference) tertile of animal organ meat intake (P value for trend =0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest for the first time that higher animal organ meat consumption is associated with a lower prevalence of NASH in Chinese individuals with biopsy-proven NAFLD.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The onset of OA is affected by a variety of factors, which eventually lead to the loss of cartilage in the joints, the formation of osteophytes, the loss of normal knee mobility, and pain and discomfort, which seriously affects the quality of life. HUC-MSCs can promote cartilage production and have been widely used in research in the past decade. This article systematically summarizes that it is well used in basic research and clinical studies to promote inflammatory chondrogenesis in the treatment of OA. Provide a theoretical basis for clinical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study collected CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, and articles related to the treatment of OA with HUC-MSCs since their publication, excluding non-basic and clinical studies such as reviews and meta-analysis. A total of 31 basic experimental studies and 12 clinical studies were included. Systematically analyze the effects of HUC-MSCs on inhibiting inflammatory factors, promoting chondrocyte production, and current clinical treatment. RESULTS: HUC-MSCs can reduce inflammatory factors such as MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$}, induced conversion from M1 to M2 in OA to protect cartilage damage and reduce OA inflammation. Synthesize ColII, SOX9, and aggrecan at the same time to promote cartilage synthesis. CONCLUSION: HUC-MSCs not only have typical stem cell biological characteristics, but also have rich sources and convenient material extraction. Compared with stem cells from other sources, HUC-MSCs have stronger proliferation, differentiation, and immune regulation abilities. Furthermore, there are no ethical issues associated with their use. SAFETY: Primarily attributed to pain, the majority of individuals experience recovery within 24~h following injection. HUC-MSCs possess the ability to alleviate pain, enhance knee joint function, and potentially postpone the need for surgical intervention in both non-surgical and other cases, making them highly deserving of clinical promotion and application.},

This study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of SedSign in differential diagnosis of LSS and non-specific low back pain (LBP) in consecutive patients. METHODS: A series of consecutive patients with lumbar spinal MRI examination for back/leg pain in orthopeadic clinic were included. These patients were followed up and divided into two groups, symptomatic LSS and non-specific LBP, according to symptoms and radiological findings. Using MR images, SedSign was assessed by two spine surgeons and one radiologist independently. Then sensitivity and specificity of SedSign was calculated. RESULT: A total of 320 patients (105 LSS and 215 non-specific LBP) were included. The SedSign had a sensitivity of 77.1~\% and specificity of 47.0~\% in the whole cohort. When these patients were stratified by dural sac cross-sectional areas (CSA), the SedSign had a sensitivity of 95.0~\% and specificity of 4.7~\% in patients with CSA~{$\leq~$}80~mm2 (severe radiologic stenosis), sensitivity of 74.2~\% and specificity of 22.6~\% in patients with CSA 80-100~mm2 (moderate radiologic stenosis), and sensitivity of 58.8~\% and specificity of 61.0~\% in patients with CSA 100-120~mm2 (mild radiologic stenosis). In selected cases composed by LSS patients with CSA~{$\leq~$}80~mm2 and non-specific LBP patients with CSA~{$>~$}120~mm2, however, the SedSign had a sensitivity of 95.0~\% and specificity of 80.0~\%. CONCLUSION: The present data demonstrated that the SedSign was not able to discriminate symptomatic LSS from non-specific LBP after adjusting by dural sac CSA. The diagnostic value of the SedSign was still uncertain.},

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Service System, VIP Database and CNIK from inception to February 2019. Two reviewers independently assessed articles' eligibility and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-II (QUADAS-2). We used a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model to conduct the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy. RESULT: Twenty-four studies were included, involving 16 scales and 15,199 patients in intensive care settings. Results indicated that the top four risk assessment scales were the Cubbin \& Jackson Index (SEN~=~0.84, SPE~=~0.84, AUC~=~0.90), the EVRUCI scale (SEN~=~0.84, SPE~=~0.68, AUC~=~0.82), the Braden scale (SEN~=~0.78, SPE~=~0.61, AUC~=~0.78), the Waterlow scale (SEN~=~0.63, SPE~=~0.46, AUC~=~0.56). The Norton scale and the other eleven scales were tested in less than two studies and need to be further researched. CONCLUSION: The Braden scale, most frequently used in hospitals, is not the best risk assessment tool for critically ill patients. The Cubbin \& Jackson Index has good diagnostic test accuracy. However, low quality of evidence and important heterogeneity were observed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of passing items above the roof level in the gross motor subtest of Peabody development motor scales (PDMS-2) on its assessment results. METHODS: In the subtests of PDMS-2, 124 children from 1.2 to 71 months were administered. Except for the original scoring method, a new scoring method which includes passing items above the ceiling were developed. The standard scores and quotients of the two scoring methods were compared using the independent-samples t test. RESULTS: Only one child could pass the items above the ceiling in the stationary subtest, 19 children in the locomotion subtest, and 17 children in the visual-motor integration subtest. When the scores of these passing items were included in the raw scores, the total raw scores got the added points of 1-12, the standard scores added 0-1 points and the motor quotients added 0-3 points. The diagnostic classification was changed only in two children. There was no significant difference between those two methods about motor quotients or standard scores in the specific subtest (P{$>$}0.05). CONCLUSION: The passing items above a ceiling of PDMS-2 isn't a rare situation. It usually takes place in the locomotion subtest and visual-motor integration subtest. Including these passing items into the scoring system will not make significant difference in the standard scores of the subtests or the developmental motor quotients (DMQ), which supports the original setting of a ceiling established by upassing 3 items in a row. However, putting the passing items above the ceiling into the raw score will improve tracking of children's developmental trajectory and intervention effects.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Purpose of Review:               Neuropathic pain is a frequently encountered condition that is often resistant to treatment and is associated with poor patient satisfaction of their treatment. Several medications have been shown to be effective in treating neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, and these medications are often used to treat neuropathic pain associated with other conditions as well. This article summarizes the diagnosis and assessment of patients with neuropathic pain as well as available pharmacologic and interventional treatment options.                                         Recent Findings:               Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain have been published, and first-line medications include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, topical agents, as well as opioid analgesics. Interventional options include anesthetic and steroid injections, nerve blocks, and spinal cord stimulation. Essential to the treatment algorithm of neuropathic pain is the assessment and treatment of psychosocial comorbidities and the utilization of a multidisciplinary team approach, including cognitive-behavioral and rehabilitative therapies. Questions remain about the comparative effectiveness of various medications and combination therapies. Increasing interest also exists in the optimization and personalization of pharmacotherapy based upon the underlying mechanism(s) of neuropathic pain according to the quality of the patient's symptoms.                                         Summary:               The management of chronic neuropathic pain is challenging and is best achieved with the use of a multidisciplinary team. Pain is a subjective experience, and it is important to validate a patient's pain, address psychosocial comorbidities, and set realistic treatment goals. Evidence-based guidelines are available to guide treatment, but frequently, high-quality evidence-based recommendations are lacking.},

RECENT FINDINGS                                Although improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of CNS TB have occurred over the past 50 years, the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB, the advent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the subsequent availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy that can produce the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome have complicated the diagnosis and treatment of CNS TB. Advances in diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis as well as the percentage of people with a confirmed rather than a presumptive diagnosis. Advances in precision medicine have identified polymorphisms in the                 LTA4H                 gene that influence the risk for inflammation in patients with tuberculous meningitis.                                                        SUMMARY               CNS TB continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with the majority of people affected living in low-income and middle-income countries. Newer diagnostic assays promise to increase the speed of diagnosis and improve appropriate selection of antituberculous therapy and anti-inflammatory medications. Despite these advances, CNS TB remains difficult to diagnose, and clinicians should have a low threshold for initiating empiric therapy in patients with presumptive infection.},
