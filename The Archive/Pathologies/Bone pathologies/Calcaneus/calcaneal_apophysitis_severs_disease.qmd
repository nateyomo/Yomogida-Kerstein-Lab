title: Sever's Disease (Calcaneal Apophysitis)
---

Sever disease (calcaneal apophysitis) is a cause of heel pain in adolescents (8-15) with immature skeletons resulting from repetitive microtrauma due to overuse @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.



# Etiology

It is theorized that the early adolescent growth spurt results in significantly more bone growth comapred to the muscle-tendon unit @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021.
As a result, this places excess stretch and tension on the the muscle-tendon unit and decreased DF ROM @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021.
This increased tension is transmitted to the incompletely-ossified apophysis @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021.
Over time, this stress can irritate the growth plate (physis) resulting in inflammation (calcaneal apophysitis) @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021.

The microtrauma of Sever's Disease can be caused by repetitive strain and microtrauma of the strong Achilles tendon on the relatively soft calcaneal apophysis @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024. 

### Increased Achilles Tendon Tension

A shortened triceps surae directly correlates to the irritation of the apophysis @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.

### Factors Impacting Severity

- High BMI @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024
- Limited ankle range of motion @smithBiochemistryOrganicChemistry2020
- Activity
    - Increased/excessive sports activity @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024
    - Running on hard surfaces
- Shoewear
    - Poorly cushioned or worn-out athletic shoes @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024
    - Cleated athletic shoes
- Biomechanics
    - Genu varum @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
    - Forefoot varus @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
    - Overpronation @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
    - Pes cavus @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
    - Pes planus @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 



Sever disease is not generally associated with traumatic events; however, in rare cases, trauma may lead to a complete avulsion fracture.[10]

# Epidemiology

- Sever's Disease is one of the leading causes of heel pain in adolescents @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.
- Sever disease contributes to 2% to 16% of all musculoskeletal complaints in children @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024

:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### Sports

The most prevalent sports associated with this condition involve repetitive running and jumping

- Basketball @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
- Soccer @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
- Track @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
- Cross-country @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 
- Gymnastics  @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024 

### Age
Sever's Disease primarily occurs during the rapid growth phase from ages 8-15 years old @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.

### Gender


- Males are more likely to develop this condition (2-3:1) @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.


### Onset

- The typical age of onset is around 12 for males and 11 for females.

# Pathophysiology

![Anatomy of Sever's Disease @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021](/The Archive/Pathologies/Bone pathologies/Calcaneus/images/Severs Disease anatomy fig2 Fares2021.png)

### Normal

The posterior calcaneus develops as a secondary ossification center that provides the attachment point for the Achilles tendon. During the early adolescent growth spurt, bone growth exceeds the ability of the muscle-tendon unit to stretch sufficiently to maintain previous flexibility. 

### Why the apophysis?

Consequently, increased tension is exerted across the unossified or incompletely ossified apophysis. The apophysis represents the most vulnerable point in the muscle-tendon-bone attachment, unlike the tendon in an adult. Therefore, the apophysis is susceptible to overuse injuries resulting from repetitive stress.

### Traumatic Stimuli

"Repetitive and excessive traction exerted by the strong Achilles tendon leads to microtrauma and chronic irritation, resulting in thickening and pain at the apophysis" @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.

### Theoretical Mechanism

Current theories attribute 
Sever disease relies on the ongoing shear stress and repetitive impact on the open calcaneal apophysis. 

:::{.callout-note}
A study revelead that patients with Sever's Disease exhibited 880 kPa peak plantar pressure during walking compared to 88 kPa in healthy controls @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.

We can hypothesize that the peak plantar pressure would also be amplified during running and jumping @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.

# Presentation

Most Sever's disease patients will  present as an active (8-15y/o) experiencing unilateral or bilateral heel pain aggravated during and after activities such as running and jumping @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.


:::{layout-ncol="3"}
### Unilateral vs Bilateral

Up to 60% of patients experience pain in both feet

### MOI

Generally, there is no specific MOI @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.

### Onset

- Insidious onset @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021
- Onset of pain will generally coincides with a recent growth spurt or a change in activity (a new sport or training, or the beginning of a sports season) @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024.

### Aggravation


### Eases
Rest tends to alleviate pain @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024


### 24 hour period
Pain is usually absent in morning and worsens with time @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024
:::

### Observation

- no signs of erythema or ecchymosis @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024
- Mild swelling at achilles insertion @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024

### Palpation

- Tenderness at Achilles insertion on the heel @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024


### PROM

- Pain with DF PROM @smithSeverDiseaseCalcaneal2024



Pain can be reproduced with manual medial and lateral compression of the posterior calcaneus and aggravated by standing on tiptoes—a phenomenon known as the Sever sign



# DDX

Sever’s disease, retrocalcaneal bursitis, Achilles tendonitis, osteomyelitis, and plantar fasciitis @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021


# Running Considerations

Running is a risk factor for Sever's Disease since children who primarily run tend to experience in muscular imbalances @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021.

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
### Stronger muscle groups

- Strong plantar flexors
- Knee extensor muscles

### Weaker Muscle groups

- Weak knee flexors
- Dorsiflexors
:::

These imbalances cause an increased strain on the muscle-tendon-bone attachment during physical activity, which predisposes to Sever’s disease.

## Assessment

- Children with Sever’s disease have increased normalized cadence while running, which could be a subconscious attempt to decrease the peak plantar pressures and subsequent pain @faresSeverDiseasePediatric2021.

# Prognosis



# Treatment


### Orthotic

- Soft heel lift in order to decrease impulse and peak force
