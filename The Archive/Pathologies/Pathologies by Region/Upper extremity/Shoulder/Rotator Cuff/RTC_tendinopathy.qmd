title: Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy

# Risk Factors

- Anatomic abnormalities in the [Intertubercular Groove]({{< var ref-humerus-bone.intertubercular-groove >}}) are associated with RTC tendinopathy @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 



# Considerations

The Transverse Ligament is now believed to be continuous with RTC tendons and the Coracohumeral Ligament @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
In addition, the presence of free nerve endings in the Transverse Ligament indicate that it could be a source of pain in the shoulder @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
