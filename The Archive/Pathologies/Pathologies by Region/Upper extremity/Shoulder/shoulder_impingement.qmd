# Primary vs Secondary

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

### Primary Impingement

- Constant narrowing of the subacromial space due to tension from structures of the shoulder @allegrucciClinicalImplicationsSecondary1994 

### Secondary Impingement

- Dynamic narrowing of structures in the subacromial space due to instability of the shoulder joint @allegrucciClinicalImplicationsSecondary1994 
- "Alterations involving the serratus anterior and lower trapezius are a common source of dysfunction, especially in cases of secondary impingement" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
