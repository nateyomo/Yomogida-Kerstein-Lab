title: Estimating Return to Sport Post-ACL injury

# Limb Index Symmetry

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

### Pros

- Better than pure strength assessment
    - Simonson (2023) found that an increased risk of a second ACL injury with every 1 NÂ·m/kg increase in relative quadriceps strength on the ACL-reconstructed side @simonsonEffectQuadricepsHamstring2023
    - No effect of relative quad strength on risk of second ACL injury when adjusting for symmetrical quadriceps strength @simonsonEffectQuadricepsHamstring2023


### Cons

- Limb Symmetry Indexes Can Overestimate Knee Function After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury @wellsandtLimbSymmetryIndexes2017
- May not be effective at predicting reinjury
    - "quadriceps strength and symmetry at 6 months did not predict reinjury; however, every month that RTA was delayed decreased the probability of subsequent injury by 28%" @bodkinPredictingAnteriorCruciate2022
