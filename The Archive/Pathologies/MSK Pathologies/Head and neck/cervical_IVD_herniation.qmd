# Cervical Herniation protection

The Cervical spine has multiple protective measures to prevent herniations.

- The nucleus pulposus (NP) is contained by PLL thus under or thru the material must pass during a herniation @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Uncovertebral joints reinforce posterolateral aspect of IVD @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


# Epidemiology

Most rare herniation in C/S = C2/3 @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


# Examination

Difficult to diagnose = because there's no motor reflexes you can test above it/at it.
