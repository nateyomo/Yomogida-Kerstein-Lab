title: Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)
---




# Epidemiology

Age:

- TOS majority is between the ages of 20-50 y/o (neuro) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Women are 3-4x more likely to develop neurogenic TOS @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010






# Types

Types:

- Neurogenic (95%) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Venous (4%) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Arterial (1%) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020




## Neurogenic

:::{.callout-note title="Neurogenic classification"}
True neurogenic TOS is classified as TOS with objective findings of nerve compression @hooperpart2

TOS with no specific pathological evidence is classified as disputed TOS @hooperpart2.
:::

- The [inferior trunk of the brachial plexus]({{< var ref-brachial-plexus.inferior-trunk >}}) is the most commonly compressed neural structure in TOS @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

- Lower plexus (c8,t1) irritation: Symptoms on ulnar side of arm, hand, ant shoulder, axillary regions @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010

- Upper plexus ( c5,6,7): Ant aspect of neck from clavicle to mandible, ear, mastoid, occasionally radiating into the side of the face @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010

## Venous

2nd most common cause of TOS (4%) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

## Arterial

3rd (least) most common cause of TOS (1% of cases) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020



# Causes

Although TOS is affected my multiple variables, there are a few structures that directly compress the structures:

- Tumor
- [1st rib elevation]({{< var ref-1st-rib.elevation >}})
- Pec minor tight (especially at full elevation)
- Ant/mid scalene
- Cervical rib approximation
- Clavicle (movement)

## Clavicle

- Clavicular mvmt can cause TOS @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- ACJ (coracoclavicular lig complex ) tension loads during arm elevation, if compromised, can load the nerve tissue @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- SCJ limitations or subluxations can lead to clavicular dysfunction @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010


# Entrapments

There are 3 main entrapments:

- Interscalene triangle @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Costoclavicular interval @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Thoraco-coraco-pectoral space: As it passes thru coracoid process, pec minor, clavipectoral fascia to enter axillary fossa @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

#1: Interscalene triangle entrapment site:
- Tight scalenes, injury of scalene or scapular suspensory muscles  @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Fibromuscular bands in scalenes or between long transverse processes of the lower cervical vertebrae @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Entrapment here can result from cervical rib presence  @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- [Subclavian vein]({{< var ref-subclavian-vein.path >}}) not involved (bc passess anterior to ant scalene) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

#2: Costoclavicular interval

- Between ribcage and posterior aspect of clavicle, entrapment can occur here with:
    - clavicle depression, 
    - Rib elevation caused by scalene hypertonicity
    - Repetitive shoulder abd
    - First rib clavicle deformity
    - Post Fracture callus formation of first rib or clavicle

#3: Thoraco-coraco-pectoral space: As it passes thru coracoid process, pec minor, clavipectoral fascia to enter axillary fossa

- Subclavian artery/vein become axillary A/V
- Neurovascular bundle compromised with elevation, abduction, especially if ER is added with motion
- Pec minor tendon compression = associated with shoulder hyperabduction

:::{.callout-note title="Double Crush Syndrome"}
[Double crush syndrome]({{< var ref-double-crush-syndrome.path >}}) refers to peripheral nerve pain caused by 2 or more entrapment sites.

The entrapment sites include the 3 main TOS entrapment sites, but double crush syndrome requires less pressure at each site to produce symptoms @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.
:::

# Symptoms

- Mild to limb threatening @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- CC - diffuse arm and shoulder pain, especially with arm elevation beyond 90 degrees @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Symptoms: pain localized in neck, face, head UE, chest,shoulder, axilla, UE paresthesia, numbness, weak, heaviness, fatigability, swelling, ulceration, raynauds, discoloration  @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


Symptom location:

- Paresthesia in the upper limb (98%)
- Neck pain (88%)
- Trapezius pain (92%)
- Shoulder and/or arm pain(88%)
- Supraclavicular pain(76%)
- Chest pain (72%)
- Occipital headache (76%)
- Paresthesias in all five fingers (58%)
- 4th and 5th fingers only (26%)
- 1-3rd fingers (14%)

# Clinical Examination

Clinical examination: 
- Rounded shoulders, forward head, inc thoracic kyphosis, posterior tilt, downward rotation, depression of scapulae @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Supraclavicular fullness = first rib prominence indicator or soft tissue swelling @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Look for:
    - Cyanosis, edema = venous @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
    - Paleness - vascular compromise @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Palpate the supraclavicular fossa @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
    - Pain = indicator @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
    - SB away, palpate post to pulsation of subclavian artery @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- If cervical spine, shoulder and TOS testing = negative, peripheral compression neuropathy is suspected @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Doppler and angiography - arterial TOS tests @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Venous TOS: venous ultrasound, scintillation scans, plethysmography,  @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Nerve conduction velocities and electromyography - neurogenic @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010



# Diagnosis

- Inspect spine, thorax, shoulder, UE for postural abnormalities, shoulder asymmetry, mm atrophy, large breasts, obesity, drooping shoulder girdle @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Palpate supraclavicular fossa for fibromuscular bands, percussion for brachial plexus irritability, auscultation for vascular bruits @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- AROM and PROM of neck/shoulder
- Neuro exam
- [Respiration]({{< var ref-respiration.path >}}): Determine if patient is using abdominanl diaphragmatic breathing
- Assess suspensory mm: middle/upper traps, lev scap, SCM (typically found to be weak) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Assess scapulothoracic mm (ant/mid scalene, subclavius, pec minor or major) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
    - Found to be short in TOS @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- First rib position or presence of cervical rib @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Clavicle position @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
    - Post fx? @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Scapula position @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- Peripheral nerve tests/cervical radiculopathy tests @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


- Symptoms vary @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Diagnoses of the 2 vascular forms of TOS are accepted in all healthcare circles @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Neurogenic TOS are difficult to diagnose bc there is not standard objective test to confirm clinical impressions @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Diagnosis of exclusion @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Diagnosis of entrapment neuropathies of the upper limb does not exclude TOS @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- [Double crush]({{< var ref-double-crush-syndrome.path >}}) is observed in 50% of cases @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010


# Testing



- Tests for compromise at the [Interscalene Triangle]({{< var ref-interscalene-triangle.path >}})
    - [Adson’s Vascular Test]({{< var ref-tos-adsons-vascular-test.path >}}) (Tests Vasculature) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
    - [Supraclavicular pressure test (Tinel's Test)]({{< var ref-tinels-test.brachial-plexus >}}) (Tests Brachial plexus) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- [Costoclavicular Space]({{< var ref-costoclavicular-space.path >}})
    - [Costoclavicular Test]({{< var ref-tos-costoclavicular-test.path >}}) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Thoraco-coraco-pectoral gate 
    - [Wright Test (Hyperabduction Maneuver)]({{< var ref-tos-wright-test.path >}}) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Loading the plexus thru TOS container
    - [Roos Test]({{< var ref-tos-roos-stress-test.path >}}) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
- Unloading the brachial plexus through the TOS container
    - [Cyriax test]({{< var ref-tos-cyriax-test.path >}}) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
    - [Passive Shoulder Shrug]({{< var ref-tos-passive-shoulder-shrug-test.path >}}) (Rules out TOS)
- Neural tissue thru thoracic outlet under a tension load
    - [Upper limb tension tests (ULTT)]({{< var ref-ultt.overview >}}) @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010

:::{.callout-caution}
- Little reliability with these tests (despite widespread use) @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
- With all of these tests: (+) test = diminution or disappearance of pulse or neuro symptoms @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
:::

## Validity

TOS maneuvers have low false positive rates when:

- A positive test is defined as pain after adson’s test, costoclavicular maneuver or supraclavicular pressure  @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998
- Discontinuation of elevated arm stress test d/t pain @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998
- Pain in same arm with >=2 maneuvers @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998
- Any symptom in the same arm with >= 3 maneuvers @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998

So there are a lot of false positives for these various tests, IN ISOLATION, EXCEPT with pain (lower false positives for SCP, CCM, AT) @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998
If there is a discontinuation of EAST d/t pain = low false positive rate (most ppl dont stop it , even if they feel some pain, but if they need to stop d/t pain then that has a low false positive rate) @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998
Less false positives for combinations of these tests @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998


Gillard et al showed a cluster of 2 provocative tests displayed the highest sensitivity (90%) while a cluster of 5 tests increased the specificity of TOS to 84% @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010

# DDX

- MI, arthritis, fibromyalgia, cervical disk disease, stenosis, MS, causalgia, carpal tennul, pancoast tumor @plewaFalsepositiveRateThoracic1998


ULTTs can be used to understand whether a patient is suffering from TOS or [double crush syndrome]({{< var ref-double-crush-syndrome.path >}})


# Intervention


**Joint mobs**: Grade 1-2 used for pain relief for acute conditions @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

## Costoclavicular space mobility

Restoring mobility to the first rib can inc the costoclavicular space and reduce imposed load on neurovascular structures in teh thoracic outlet container @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a

- Studies reported dec’d TOS symptoms by restoring mobility of first rib thru manual therapy @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a

- Encouraging diaphragmatic breathing helps reduce overuse of scalenes during breathing
Accessory muscle of breathing (scalene)
Vigorous aerobic activities may inc scalene activity and elevation of first rib, so careful use of aerobic activities may help reduce symptoms, especially early in the rehab
Mobilization of SCJ and ACJ is necessary to restore normal end range arthrokinematics of clavicle during elevation activities
End range limits of DGJ motion can lead to compromise of costoclavicular space as well
Can be addressed w mobs in the elevated arm position (ie humerus gliding ant, post and inf) 


First rib mobilization


CVJ mobilization 


# Rehabilitation

## Conservative Management

When should you advise conservative treatment over surgery?

- Conservative measures shld be attempted for pt w/ disputed neuro TOS before surgery is considered but arterial or venous TOS should be treated with surgery to avoid loss of limb @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a.
- Hooper et al found success in conservative management in disputed neuro TOS patients at both short term (76-100%) and long term (59-88%) @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a.

When should you advise against conservative therapy?

- Conservative therapy is not recommended for venous or arterial TOS since there is a high chance of limb loss following complications @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a.
- Poor outcomes w conservative therapy (Novak et al ) → obesity, workers compensation, double crush pathology involving the carpal or cubital tunnel.

Patient education

Sleep hygiene
- Avoid provocative positions during night if pain is position dependent @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a
- Place pillows between arm and body w/ side lying or place under each arm when lying supine @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a
- [Cyriax Release Maneuver]({{< var ref-cyriax-release-maneuver.path >}}): Can unload the neurovascular structures prior to sleeping @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a

Manual Techniques

- Traction could help  @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a


## Pharmacological options

Possible Options:

- NSAIDs @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a
- Botulinum toxin (ant to middle scalenes) @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a
    - 64% of subjects had a min 50% decrease in pain, numbness, fatigue for at least one month following injection  @hooperpart2ThoracicOutletSyndrome2010a


- Can take up to 2-3 hours
- Pt education– informing pt about disease process, potential prognosis 
- Compliance to exercise program is important for determining outcomes of conservative therapy 


# Prognosis

Release phenomenon: release of tension/compression of perineural blood supply to brachial plexus and return of normal sensation = prognostic indicator of favorable outcome @hooperThoracicOutletSyndrome2010
