title: Osteoarthritis

- Perforation of articular cartilage via a single high mag or repetitive stress
- Dec fluid pressurization → load transfer from fluid to tissue matrix
- Inc stress on tissue matrix → further damage
- Results: erosion of articular cartilage → exposure of subchondral bone → pain
- Dec ability to withstand loads
