title: Proximal Tibiofibular Joint
---

"The proximal, or superior, tibiofibular joint (see Fig. 20-1) is an almost plane joint with a slight convexity on the oval tibial facet and a slight concavity on the fibular head. The joint is located below the tibial plateau on the lateral condyle of the tibia. The tibial articulating facet faces laterally, posteriorly, and inferiorly. Although the joint is often described as a simple, synovial, modified ovoid, it functions as a modified sellar when combined with the distal, or inferior, tibiofibular joint (see Chapter 21)" @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


"The joint capsule of the proximal tibiofibular joint complex is thicker anteriorly than posteriorly and, in 10% of the population, the synovium is continuous with that of the knee joint.1 The joint receives support from anterior and posterior ligaments and an interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane attaches between the medial border of the fibula and the lateral border of the tibia, providing attachment to the deep anterior and posterior muscles of the leg. The majority of its fibers pass obliquely in an inferior and lateral direction." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

"The proximal tibiofibular joint has more motion than its distal partner. The motion occurring at the proximal joint, consists of two glides, one in a superoinferior direction and the other in an anteroposterior direction.1 These motions are possible because of the orientation of the joint line, which also facilitates an osteokinematic spin of the fibula. The motion at this joint can be decreased by articular fibrosis or by softtissue restraints; the biceps femoris can pull or hold it posteriorly, whereas the tibialis anterior can pull or hold it anteriorly." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

"Although the capsular pattern of restriction for this joint is unclear, it is probably indicated by pain during an isometric contraction of the biceps femoris with the knee at 90 degrees of flexion. The close-packed position for this joint, equally debatable, is probably weight-bearing (WB) ankle dorsiflexion." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020


"Both the tibia and the fibula are vulnerable to fracture at the lower third of their shaft. Anterior joint subluxations occur at this joint as a result of medial knee joint strain or an inversion sprain of the ankle. Posterior joint subluxation can occur as a result of a lateral knee joint strain, but this is often missed because of the more serious ligament damage to the knee." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

# Innervation

"The nerve supply to this joint is provided by the common fibular (peroneal) and recurrent articular nerves. The joint receives its blood supply from a perforating branch of the fibular (peroneal) artery and the anterior tibial artery." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020

### Dorsiflexion

According to Dutton, during DF the fibula glides superiorly at the proximal tibiofibular joint @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
