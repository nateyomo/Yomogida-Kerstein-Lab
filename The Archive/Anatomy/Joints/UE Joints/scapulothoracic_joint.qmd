title: Scapulothoracic Joint
---


# Alignment

- Vertebral border
    - Parallel to spine, 2-3 finger width (3’’) from the midline of the thorax
- Between 2nd and 7th thoracic vertebrae
- 30&deg; ant to the frontal plane (scapular plane)
- 10&deg; ant tilt
- 5-10&deg; upward rotation

# Kinematics

## Upward Rotation

60 deg upward rotation during arm elevation




### Force couple

- Serratus anterior (greatest mechanical advantage for UR)
- Upper trap (Initiation and throughout)
- Late phase: Lower trap

### Stabilization

- Middle trap (add / retract) which counteract the protraction force of the Serratus anterior, resulting in stabilization of the scapula

## Downward rotation

## Anterior Tilt

## Posterior Tilt

20&deg; post tilt during arm elevation

## Elevation

Scapular elevation (pure)
Includes elevation of clavicle at SC and downward rot of scap at AC


## Depression

- Lats
- Pec Minor
- Lower trapezius

## Internal Rotation

<= 5&deg; IR/ER 

## External Rotation

<= 5&deg

# Stabilization

The Serratus Anterior (along with the rhomboids) serves to aid in scapular stability during arm elevation @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 

![Superior View of the shoulder: You can see how the rhomboids and SA both actively stabilize the scapulothoracic joint by pulling the scapula towards the thoracic wall @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020](/The Archive/Anatomy/Skeletal Muscles/Upper Limb Muscles/Axioappendicular Posterior Muscles/images/Dutton fig16.2 Superior aspect of shoulder.png)
