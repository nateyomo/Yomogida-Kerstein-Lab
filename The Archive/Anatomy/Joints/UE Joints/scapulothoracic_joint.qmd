title: Scapulothoracic Joint
---



# Upward Rotation

Force couple

- Serratus anterior (greatest mechanical advantage for UR)
- Upper trap (Initiation and throughout)
- Late phase: Lower trap

Stabilization

- Middle trap (add / retract) which counteract the protraction force of the Serratus anterior, resulting in stabilization of the scapula


# Scapular Depression

- Lats
- Pec Minor
- Lower trapezius

# Stabilization

The Serratus Anterior (along with the rhomboids) serves to aid in scapular stability during arm elevation @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020 

![Superior View of the shoulder: You can see how the rhomboids and SA both actively stabilize the scapulothoracic joint by pulling the scapula towards the thoracic wall @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020](/The Archive/Anatomy/Skeletal Muscles/Upper Limb Muscles/Axioappendicular Posterior Muscles/images/Dutton fig16.2 Superior aspect of shoulder.png)
