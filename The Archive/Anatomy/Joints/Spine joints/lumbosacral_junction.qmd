title: Lumbosacral Junction
---


- Apophyseal joints oriented closer to the frontal plane.
- Base of sacrum inclined ~40&deg; anteriorly/inferiorly
- Large amount of shear forces at L5-S1 resisted by:
    - Orientation of the articular facets.
    - ALL & iliolumbar ligaments resist shear.
- Shear forces increase with increased sacral inclination:
    - Structure of sacrum
    - Anterior pelvic tilt
