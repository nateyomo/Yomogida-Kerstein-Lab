title: Sternoclavicular Joint (SCJ)
---


The sternoclavicular joint is a saddle joint

# Arthrokinematics

Since the SCJ is a saddle joint, both the distal and proximal joint surfaces have concave and convex facets.

- Frontal plane: 
    - Convex on Concave
    - Superior roll and inferior slide
- Transverse plane:
    - Concave on convex
    - Concave clavicle on convex sternum 
    - Anterior roll and slide


# Joint position

- 6&deg; upward slope
- Posterior to the frontal plane 20 deg
- Protraction = retraction (15-30 deg)
- Rotation (post) 40-50 deg
- Elevation (45-60 deg) > depression (10-15)

### Active Stability
The subclavius muscle works to actively stabilize the clavicle in the SCJ [@duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020; @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020]
:::

# Clinical Significance

Biomechanical studies have shown a variation of 15-31 degrees in the SC joint through the rotation of the clavicle during the movements of the arm in the frontal plane (abduction) and less in the sagittal plane (flexion) @ludewigThreedimensionalClavicularMotion2004 (Ludewig et al. 2004)

# Clinical Presentation

AROM limitations 
- ABD is most limited when missing a clavicle
