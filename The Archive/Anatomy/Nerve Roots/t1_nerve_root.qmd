# Lesion

"Sensory disturbances occur on the medial arm. Paresis occurs variably in the following muscles: abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, all lumbricals and interossei, abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, and adductor pollicis [16]. The finger flexor reflex (C8 T1) may be depressed. Sympathetic fibers destined for the superior cervical ganglia are interrupted, resulting in an ipsilateral Horner syndrome." @brazisLocalizationClinicalNeurology2022

# Examination

## Muscle Strength

"Hand Intrinsics (T1) The patient is asked to squeeze the clinicianâ€™s fingers between their fingers while the clinician tries to pull their fingers away (Fig. 25-30). Based on the findings from the history, systems review, and key muscle testing, a sensory examination may be necessary (see Chapter 3)." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
