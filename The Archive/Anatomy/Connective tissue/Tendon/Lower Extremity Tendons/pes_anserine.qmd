Pes anserine refers to the complex made up of the combined tendons of semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius.

# Muscular Attachment

- Semitendinosus
- Gracilis
- Sartorius

# Function


"As a group the “pes muscles” are effective internal rotators of the knee. Connective tissues hold the tendons of the pes group just posterior to the medial-lateral axis of rotation of the knee. The three pes muscles therefore flex as well as internally rotate the knee." @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 

"Along with the MCL and posteriormedial capsule, active tension in the pes muscles resists knee external rotation and valgus loads applied to the knee" @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017 

# Dysfunction

- Pes Anserine Bursitis
