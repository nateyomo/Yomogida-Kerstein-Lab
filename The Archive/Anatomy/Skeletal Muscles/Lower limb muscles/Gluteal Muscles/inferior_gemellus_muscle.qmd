### Origin
Ischial tuberosity
Jointly with obturator internus tendon (medial surface, greater trochanter)

External rotation and extension of the hip joint (also active in abduction, depending on the joint’s position), stabilizes hip joint

### Insertion


### Innervation

Nerve to quadratus femoris ([L5]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l5 >}}), [S1]({{< var ref-nerve-root.s1 >}})) @aungAnatomicalStudyObturator2001 


### Action

:::

# Overview



“The gemellus	superior and inferior (from the Latin root geminus, meaning twins) are two, small, nearly identically sized muscles with proximal attachments on either side of the lesser sciatic notch (see Fig. 12.43). Each muscle blends in with the central tendon of the obturator internus for a common attachment to the femur. Immediately below the gemellus inferior is the quadratus	 femoris muscle. This flat muscle arises from the external side of the ischial tuberosity and inserts on the posterior side of the proximal femur. In cases of abnormal bony morphology, this muscle may become impinged between the lesser trochanter and ischium, typically during motions that involve the extremes of external rotation.212 If chronic and repetitive, this clinically termed “ischiofemoral impingement” may cause groin and buttock pain along with abnormal MR signaling from the qua­ dratus femoris muscle” @neuman
