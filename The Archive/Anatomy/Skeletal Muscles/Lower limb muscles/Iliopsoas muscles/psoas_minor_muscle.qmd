# Overview

Found in only 50% of the population @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020 

“The psoas minor, present in approximately 50% of the population, is often found on the superficial surface of the psoas major (see Fig. 31.19). It is not a muscle of the lower limb. It originates, inserts, and exerts its action on the abdomen” @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
