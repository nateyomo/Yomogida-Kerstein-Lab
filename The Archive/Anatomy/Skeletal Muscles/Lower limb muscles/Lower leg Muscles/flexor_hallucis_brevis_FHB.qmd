# MMT

"The FHB VIDEO and FHL muscles VIDEO produce MTP joint flexion and IP joint flexion. The foot is maintained in midposition. The first metatarsal is stabilized, and resistance is applied beneath the proximal and distal phalanx of the great toe into toe extension." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
