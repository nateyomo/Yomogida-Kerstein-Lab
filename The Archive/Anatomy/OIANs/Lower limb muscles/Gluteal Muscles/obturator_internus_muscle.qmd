# Overview

“Ultrasound ­guided EMG analysis of the obturator internus and several other external rotator muscles in 10 human subjects.98 The obturator internus was usually the first muscle to become active during a gradually increasing isometric effort to abduct and externally rotate the hip.” @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017
