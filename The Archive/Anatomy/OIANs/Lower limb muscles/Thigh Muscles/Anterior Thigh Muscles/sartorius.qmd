# Overview

"sartorius, the longest muscle in the body, originates at the anterior­superior iliac spine (see Fig. 12.26). This thin, fusiform muscle courses distally and medially across the thigh to attach on the medial surface of the proximal tibia (see Fig. 13.7). The name sartorius is based on the Latin root sartor, referring to a tailor’s position of cross­legged sitting, which happens to describe the muscle’s combined action of hip flexion, external rotation, and abduction." @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017
