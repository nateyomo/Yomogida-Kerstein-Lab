title: Adductor Muscle Group
---



"The hip adductors, which play an indirect role in the medial stability of the knee (Table 20-3), are described in Chapter 19. The exception to this is the two-joint gracilis muscle, the third member of the pes anserinus group, which in addition to adducting and flexing the hip, assists in flexion of the knee and internal rotation of the lower leg." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
