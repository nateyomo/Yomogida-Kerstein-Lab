title: Cuneiform Bones
---

"The cuneiform bones (from the Latin root meaning “wedge”) act as a spacer between the navicular and bases of the three medial metatarsal bones (see Fig. 14.4). The cuneiforms contribute to the transverse arch of the foot, accounting, in part, for the transverse convexity of the dorsal aspect of the midfoot." @neumannKinesiologyMusculoskeletalSystem2017
