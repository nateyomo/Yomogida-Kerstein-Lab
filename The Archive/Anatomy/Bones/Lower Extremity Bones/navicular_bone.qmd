title: Navicular Bone

# Palpation

"he navicular is the most prominent bone on the medial aspect of the foot. The navicular tuberosity can be located by moving proximally from the medial aspect of the first cuneiform (see Fig. 21-1). The talonavicular joint line lies directly proximal to the navicular tuberosity. In addition, the posterior tibialis, which can be made more prominent with resisted plantar flexion, adduction, and supination, can be used as a reference as it inserts on the plantar surface of the navicular (see later). Tenderness of the navicular could indicate the presence of a fracture or osteochondritis of the navicular (KÃ¶hler disease)." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
