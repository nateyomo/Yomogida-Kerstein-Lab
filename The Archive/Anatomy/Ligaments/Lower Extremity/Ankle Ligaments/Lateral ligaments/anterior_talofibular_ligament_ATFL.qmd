title: Anterior Talofibular Ligament (ATFL)

# Palpation

"The ATFL can be palpated two to three finger-breadths anteroinferior to the lateral malleolus (see Fig. 21-5). This is usually the area of most extreme tenderness following an inversion sprain. The anterior aspect of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis may also be tender following this type of sprain." @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
