title: Ligaments

---


# Histology

- More Type I Collagen than Elastin
- Low/moderate number of GAGs


# Mechanical Properties

- Can vary depending on ligament.
- Stiffer for joint protection.
- Fiber bundles oriented in multiple directions to withstand multi‚Äêdirectional loads.
- Blood supply varies based on ligament.

# Remodeling

- Reduced stress (immobilization):
    - Decreased CSA
    - Decreased stiffness
    - Decreased strength
- Increased stress (exercise): healthy levels
    - Increased CSA
    - Increased stiffness
    - Increased strength

# Injury

- Results in instability
- Many people unable to attenuate JRFs
- Injury/degeneration of other periarticular structures

# Healing

Healing depends on extent of injury, blood supply and
angiogenesis.

# Treatment

- Natural history
- Repair
