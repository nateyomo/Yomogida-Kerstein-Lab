# Compression

Interscalene space compression can cause pathologies, such as thoracic outlet syndrome


- Thoracic outlet syndrome
    - The Adson's Test is believed to improve
    - According to those who proposed the Adson's Vascular test, this position theoretically tensions anterior and middle scalenes, compromising (compressing) the interscalene triangle @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020.

Contrasting biomechanical evidence finds the scalene angle to increase, which should reduce likelihood of compression @duttonDuttonOrthopaedicExamination2020
