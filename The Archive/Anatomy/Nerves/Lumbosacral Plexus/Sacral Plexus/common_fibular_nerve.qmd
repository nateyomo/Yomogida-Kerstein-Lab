# Pathway

# Motor innervation

## Direct Motor Innervation

Bicep femoris (short head) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Cutaneous Innervation

- There is no direct cutaneous innervation from the common fibular nerve, but there is indirect cutaneous innervation through its branches @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020. 
    - Sural nerve (shared common fib and tibial)
