# Roots

[L1]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l1 >}}), [L2]({{< var ref-nerve-root.l2 >}}) @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020

# Pathway

- Pierces psoas major anteriorly below the former 2 nerves to immediately split into 2 branches that run down on ant side of the muscle
- Genital branch differs in Males vs Females
    - Males: runs in spermatic cord and then sends sensory branches to scrotal skin. In males in supplies motor innervation to cremaster
    - Females: runs w teres uteri ligament and sends sensory branches to labia majora
- Passes through inguinal canal



# Motor innervation

# Cutaneous Innervation

- Lateral, femoral branch = sensory
- Supplies skin below inguinal, prox lat aspect of femoral triangle

# Dysfunction

Entrapment; rare
