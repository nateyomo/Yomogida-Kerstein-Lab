"Ischemia (diminished blood flow) of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh can result when the nerve is stretched or entrapped by the inguinal ligament (see Fig. 34.11B) during hyperextension of the hip or with increased lordosis (curvature) of the lumbar spine, as often occurs during pregnancy. This results in pain, numbness, or paresthesia (tingling or burning) on the outer aspect of the thigh. It is most commonly found in obese or diabetic individuals and in pregnant women." @gilroyAtlasAnatomy2020
