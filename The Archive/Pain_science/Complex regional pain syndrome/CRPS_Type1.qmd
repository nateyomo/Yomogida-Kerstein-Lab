title: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I (Formerly reflex sympathetic dystrophy)
---

A syndrome that usually develops after an initiating noxious event, is not limited to the distribution of a single peripheral nerve, and is apparently disproportionate to the inciting event. It is associated at some point with evidence of edema, changes in skin blood flow, abnormal pseudomotor activity in the region of the pain, or allodynia or hyperalgesia. Specific criteria for the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) have been proposed. @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019
