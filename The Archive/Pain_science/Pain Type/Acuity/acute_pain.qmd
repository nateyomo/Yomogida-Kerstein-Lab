# Definition

## Problems with traditional acute/chronic classification 

Traditionally, Acute vs chronic pain has been defined based on an arbitrary time frame (3mo or 6mo) @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019.
These criteria do not take into consideration

- Intensity of pain @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019
- Severity @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019
- Nature of its impact on functioning or treatment-seeking behaviors @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019
- Whether pain must be present every day @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019
- How frequent it occurs in this interval @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019

## New Classification
A new classification was proposed conceptualizing acute and chronic pain on two dimensions: time and physical pathology @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019

Acute pain is the physiologic response to and experience of noxious stimuli that can become pathologic, is normally sudden in onset, is time-limited, and motivates behaviors to avoid potential or actual tissue injury @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019. 
Pain is elicited by the injury of body tissues and activation of nociceptive transducers at the site of local tissue damage @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019. 
The local injury alters the response characteristics of the nociceptors and perhaps their central connections and the autonomic nervous system in the region @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019. 
In general, the state of acute pain lasts for a relatively limited time and remits when the underlying pathology resolves @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019. 
This type of pain often serves as the impetus to seek health care, and it occurs following trauma, some disease processes, and invasive interventions @ballantyneBonicaManagementPain2019.
