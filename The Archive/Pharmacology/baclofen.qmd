# Cerebral Palsy

- Baclofen: oral or intrathecal administration
- Works through decreasing transmissions at
spinal level in CSF
- Adverse effects: drowsiness, lethargy, ataxia, dizziness

As a clinician you should look for these side effects, and if the patient's side effects are worse than the benefits, maybe you should recommend that they reassess with the doctor.
