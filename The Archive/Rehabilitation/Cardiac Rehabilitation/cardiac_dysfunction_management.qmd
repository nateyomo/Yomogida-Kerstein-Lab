# Revascularization and reperfusion of myocardium

- Thrombolytic therapy
- Percutaneous revascularization procedures
    - PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty)
    - Balloon procedure
    - Vessel can not be fully occluded, only partially
    - Can place stent in valve (keeps vessels open)
    - A lesser intervention compared to bypass
    - Most common
    - Vessels cant be fully occluded
    - May place endoluminal stents

# Transmyocardial Revascularization

- Catheter w laser tip
- Creates channels from patent arteries into ischemic area
- For chronic angina in pts unable to have PTCA or CABG
- Last line of defense for chronic angina, and unable to target full balloon or bypass (if not great surgical candidates for other procedures)

# CABG
CABG: Coronary artery bypass graft

:::{.callout title="Reading CABG Documentation"}

- CABGx4 = A CABG with 4 vessels treated
:::



- Coronary artery is completely occluded (can't do balloon and stent at this point)
- Vascular graft used to revascularize myocardium
    - Saphenous vein  (MOST times) 
    - Radial artery
    - Left internal mammary artery
    - Right internal mammary artery
    - Artery to artery is nice, veins have valves 
- [Median sternotomy]({{< var ref-median-sternotomy.path >}})
    - Intense, big surgery
    - Balloon is first line of defense if possible
    - This will be a couple a day stay 

## Minimally invasive CABG

- Laparoscopic and robotic techniques
- Avoids median sternotomy
- Decâ€™d pain and infection in leg incisions
- Best for occlusions in ant coronary arteries
- May combine w/ PTCA for multiple blockages

## Off Pump CABG

- Median sternotomy
- Grafting w beating, normothermic heart
- Regional ischemia for 5-15 min 
- Reduced inflammatory response, suggests less myocyte injury


# Median sternotomy


:::{.callout title="Sternal PRecautions"}

- Premise is to reduce dehiscence
- ? evidence
- 8 weeks
- Restrict UE lifting to < 10 pounds
- No pushing, pulling 
- No scapular ADDUCTION
- No resistance or loading of UE past 90 in flexion or abduction
- Minimal arm use for transfers

# Ablation procedures

Catheter ablation
Venous access usually
Indications
SVT
AV node dysfunction
A fib
A flutter
V tach (certain types)
Low power, high freq AC current to destroy cardiac tissue
