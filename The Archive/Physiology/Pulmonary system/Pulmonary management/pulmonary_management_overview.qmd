title: Pulmonary Management
---


# Pharmacologic agents

- Adrenocortical steroids
- Antihistamines
- Bronchodilators 
- Leukotriene modifiers
- Mast cell stabilizers

:::{.callout-note}
PTs should time their treatment with the patient's medications in mind
:::


# Surgical interventions

- Depending on pt and condition., common w cancer or lung pneumonia or fibrosis
- Wedge resection, segmental resection, lobectomy 
- Pneumonectomy - whole lung removed 


# PT interventions

## Goals 
- Independence in mobility
- Maximize gas exchange (improve ventilation and airway clearance)
- Increase aerobic capacity
- Increase respiratory mm endurance

## Patient education
Review the condition and offer advice on how to help patient maximize rehab or perform compensations to maximize current level of function


# Bronchopulmonary Hygiene / Airway clearance techniques (ACT)

- Understand pathophysiology of condition
    - ACT not always indicated
- Assess before, during and after ACT
    - Vital signs before and after
    - Auscultation before and after
- Combine with O2 and meds as needed

## Contraindications

- Blood in lungs
- Burns
- Recent incision sites
- Lung contusion, empyema– in pleural space so NO = pleural effusion or something, dont do it! , rib fx etc can be reasons to not do airway clearance


## Cough effectiveness

:::{layout-ncol="3"}

### Medications

- Pain meds (if pain is limiting issue to the cough)

### Splinting

- Use splints if they have incisions
- can be w pillow (ie heart pillow for sternal precaution)
- Provide counterpressure w arms

### Positioning

- Positioning

### Hydration

- Especially important with older patients
- dehydration makes secretions harder to mobilize
:::


## Examples of ACT

- Percussion
- Vibration
- Autogenic drainage
- Active cycle of breathing
- Nasotracheal Suctioning (NT)
- Flutter valves: Flutter valves should be used in adjunct to manual ACT
- Postural drainage (see Ch22 of Paz @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020)

## Choosing ACT based on disorder

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

### Obstructive disorders

- Pursed lip breathing
- Rest breaks between coughs

### Restrictive disorders

- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Chest wall stretching 
:::



# Activity progression

- RPE better than HR - pulmonary usually more limiting that cardiac
- Shorter more frequent sessions
- Education on energy conservation– pacing
- Document need for rests and duration of rest during txt
- Bronchopulmonary hygiene prior to exercise may be beneficial


# Precautions

- Table 22.3 - test question!!!!
- Consider head position (ICP monitor – no less than 30 deg on the bed, remember certain positions can be limited)
- ICP monitoring 
- Chest wall complications
- Platelets <20k (risk of bleeding w percussion)
- Osteoporosis

## Percussion, Postural Drainage, and Vibration/Shaking

:::{layout-ncol="3"}

### Benefits

- Feasible for use with patients who are unable to follow commands @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Can individualize treatment to target specific lobes based on patient disease process @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020

### Considerations

- Most beneficial when used in conjunction with additional airway clearance techniques (ACTs) @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Patient cannot be independent with percussion or vibration/shaking; requires caregiver assistance @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Passive @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Time and effort intensive @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- May be uncomfortable if pain is present @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Modification of postural drainage positions may be required with patients with increased intracranial pressure, decreased cardiac output, pulmonary hemorrhage, and severe dyspnea 
- Postural drainage should be modified to remove head down positioning in infants and patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020


### Contraindications

- High intracranial pressure (>20 mmHg) @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Uncontrolled hypertension @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Uncontrolled or unprotected airway with risk of aspiration 
- Recent esophageal surgery @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Significantly distended abdomen @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Pulmonary edema and/or orthopnea @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Integumentary abnormalities over the area to be percussed or vibrated, such as burns, skin grafts, or open wounds @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Rib fractures, flail chest, rib metastases @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Acute hemorrhage and/or hemodynamic instability @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
- Unstable head or neck injury @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020
