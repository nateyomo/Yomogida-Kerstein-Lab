# Pharmacologic agents

- Adrenocortical steroids
- Antihistamines
- Bronchodilators 
- Leukotriene modifiers
- Mast cell stabilizers

:::{.callout-note}
PTs should time their treatment with the patient's medications in mind
:::


# Surgical interventions

- Depending on pt and condition., common w cancer or lung pneumonia or fibrosis
- Wedge resection, segmental resection, lobectomy 
- Pneumonectomy - whole lung removed 


# PT interventions

## Goals 
- Independence in mobility
- Maximize gas exchange (improve ventilation and airway clearance)
- Increase aerobic capacity
- Increase respiratory mm endurance

## Patient education
Review the condition and offer advice on how to help patient maximize rehab or perform compensations to maximize current level of function


# Bronchopulmonary Hygiene / Airway clearance techniques (ACT)

- Understand pathophysiology of condition
    - ACT not always indicated
- Assess before, during and after ACT
    - Vital signs before and after
    - Auscultation before and after
- Combine with O2 and meds as needed

## Contraindications

- Blood in lungs
- Burns
- Recent incision sites
- Lung contusion, empyemaâ€“ in pleural space so NO = pleural effusion or something, dont do it! , rib fx etc can be reasons to not do airway clearance


## Cough effectiveness

### Medications

- Pain meds (if pain is limiting issue to the cough)

### Splinting

- Use splints if they have incisions
- can be w pillow (ie heart pillow for sternal precaution)
- Provide counterpressure w arms

### Positioning

- Positioning

### Hydration

- Especially important with older patients
- dehydration makes secretions harder to mobilize
:::


## Examples of ACT

- Percussion
- Vibration
- Autogenic drainage
- Active cycle of breathing
- Postural drainage (see Ch22 of Paz @pazAcuteCareHandbook2020)

### NT suctioning (nasotracheal suctioning)

### Flutter valve 
Flutter valves should be used in adjunct to manual ACT

## Choosing ACT based on disorder

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

### Obstructive disorders

- Pursed lip breathing
- Rest breaks between coughs

### Restrictive disorders

- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Chest wall stretching
