# Stroke volume

- 55-100 ml/beat
- Three factors that can affect it=
    - Preload: Max volume of blood in L ventricle (LVEDV = L ventricular end diastolic volume)2
    - Inotropy: ability of ventricle to contract 
    - Afterload: force L ventricle must generate during systole to overcome aortic p to open aortic valve

# Cardiac output

- Amount of blood d/câ€™d from L or R ventricle per minute

$$ 
\textrm{Cardiac Output} = (\textrm{Stroke Volume}) \times (\textrm{Heart Rate})
$$

- Average adult: 4-5 L/min

# Ejection fraction

- Percent of blood emptied from ventricle during systole
- Average = 60-70%

$$
\textrm{Ejection Fraction} = \frac{\textrm{Stroke Volume}}{\textrm{Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume (LVEDV)}}
$$
