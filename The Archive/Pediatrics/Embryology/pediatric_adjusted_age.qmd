title: Adjusted age in pediatrics
---


The adjusted age is used to determine the age a premature child would be if they had been born "on time" (40 weeks of gestation).
This is an important calculation since it will help the clinician understand how developed the child should be at this point in time.
A premature baby may be 1 year old, but if they were born 8 weeks premature, then their level of development should be at 10 months.

# Calculation

Adjusted age = Chronological age - (Prematurity)

Adjusted age = Chronological age - (40 weeks - Time in gestation)

:::{.callout title="Example Calculation"}
Baby who was born at 30 weeks of gestation on june 6 and the current date is December 10th

Chronological age: 7 months 0 weeks 4 days

Prematurity = (40 - 30 weeks of gestation) = 10 weeks premature

Adjusted age = Chronological age - 10weeks

Adjusted age = 4mo 2 weeks 4 days
