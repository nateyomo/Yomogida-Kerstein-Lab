# Why should we care about normal development?

- Need a baseline for “normal” to identify problems
- Identifies atypical behavior

# Developmental sequence 


:::{.callout title="Darrah et al. (1998)"}

Darrah et al 1998, tested motor skills of 45 infants every month from 2 weeks to time of independent walking

- Ton of variability is what he found
- Created Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS)
- LARGE variation in motor skills in first year
- All pts will present differently, Examination is a snapshot of what happens in that moment
    - Could differ (dependent on emotion, sleepiness, etc) 
- So may not be entirely accurate– must keep in mind

# Variability in Development

## Intrinsic and Extrinsic factors

- **Individual**:  physiology (ie height weight of baby), temperament, cognition 
<details>
(one with lower cognition will have less motivation to move)
</details>

- **Environment**: immediate microsystem → womb, family, home, surroundings, peers 
<details>
    - (could also be in utero environment, was there trauma w their pregnant person)
</details>

- **Exosystem**: extended family, neighborhood, school
- **Macrosystem**: community, economic system, culture
