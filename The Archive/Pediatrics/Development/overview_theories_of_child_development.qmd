# Neuromaturational Theory

- Development follows a set, invariant sequence @effgenMeetingPhysicalTherapy2021.
- Development is tightly tied to central nervous system development @effgenMeetingPhysicalTherapy2021.
- Motor development is cephalocaudal and proximal to distal @effgenMeetingPhysicalTherapy2021.
- Recent modifications acknowledge variations in the sequence and input from all systems @effgenMeetingPhysicalTherapy2021.

McGraw & Gesell were the main proponents of the original theory, which consisted of a step type sequence of development and intervention, Not totally linear, but more or less linear

There is a Newer version of theory; can you adapt /change pattern 
CNS maturation drives development
Normal sequence / hierarchy of skill development
Classic developmental scales based on this work
Importance of developmental reflexes and stepwise sequence of development in intervention


Gessell
She says: As you start to master one skill, and u introduce the other skill, u may see a regression is previous skill or new skill wont look perfect
Development happens in a proximal to distal sequence, motor skills develop gross to fine
Development is dynamic and characterized by alternating advancement and regression
Crawling: initial symmetrical arm pattern, then alternates UE
Regression to earlier patterns as more mature version occurs 


# Cognitive Theory

•Thinkingdevelopsinstagesofincreasingcomplexity. • Children organize mental schemes through the use of mental operations @effgenMeetingPhysicalTherapy2013.

Piaget: cognitive development theory
- 4 stages of cognitive development (inc complexity)
    - Sensorimotor stage (0-2 years): reflex activity leads to purposeful mvmt
    - Pre operational stage (2-7) : unidimensional awareness of environment
    - Concrete operational stage (7-11) less egocentric, solve concrete probs
    - Formal operational stage (11+): solve abstract probs, deductive reasoning
    - Child’s active involvement in environment (not just neuromaturation) critical to infant development
- Scaffolding: parents/therapists provide environmental challenge that encourages a child to perform higher level skill
- Some EC programs based on this
    - Montessori: uses cognitive and developmental theories
        - Child given freedom to interact and engage in environment and self select activities from specialized materials
    - Reggio emilia: investigatory and exploratory environment helps with problem solving skills
