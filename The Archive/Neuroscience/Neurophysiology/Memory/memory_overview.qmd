- Implicit memory:



# Neurophysiology

Stored in hippocampus temporary then moves to association areas then other areas

# Types

## Explicit Memory

- AKA declarative memory
- A collection of memory systems that together are responsible for the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of information that can be consciously and intentionally recollected
- Examples of explicit memory include remembering a specific fact, a specific event, or the steps required to complete a task.

## Implicit memory

- AKA "procedural memory" or "nondeclarative memory"
- Cannot be accessed by conscious recall but occurs through unconscious systems such as movement or perception

# Impairments

- Immediate Re-call & Short term Memory â€“ Remedial Tx Suggestions:
    - address attention first, organize material with associations, for easy retrieval, ask about previous strategies
- Compensatory: 
    - Diary, Logs, Environmental Prompts
