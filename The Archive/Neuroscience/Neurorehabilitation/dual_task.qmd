title: Dual Tasking
---

Dual tasking is defined as concurrent performance of 2 tasks that can be performed independently and have distinct and separate goals.
Each task can be measured independently as a single task.


# Dual Task Effect (DTE)

- Measure performance of each task in isolation *single task*
    - Gait alone, 
    - Cognitive task alone
- Measure performance of each task while performed concurrently (dual task)

How to measure DTE:

- Absolute measures: single task and dual task parameters (ie gait speed)
- Relative measures: dual task effect (cost/benefit)
- DTE (%) = ((+- (dual task - single task)/ single task ))x100
- Motor cognitive tasks
- Motor motor tasks

$$
\textrm{Dual Task Effect (5)} = \frac{}{} 
$$


# Indications

Dual tasking improves:

- Progression of parkinsons, 
- Risk of dementia


# Dual task T&M

- Cognitive Four Square Step Test: CFSST
    - (similar to how tug has a cognitive tug ) 
- Serial 3s subtraction
- Spell a 6 or 7 letter word backwards
- Digit span recall
- 6 word recall (words presented prior, 1 min to memorize)
- 6 word generation (pt picks category, names words during)
- Remembered sequence with direction change
- DT cost in terms of %, a function of time loss +/- cognitive %


# Why Dual tasking is important

- Dual tasking cannot be avoided in real life, 
- Ability to tolerate a distraction 
    - Can **habituate** or improve w training
    - Can draw awareness to the impact of distractions
- Improves independence
- TRAINABLE

# Neurophysiology

- Primary attention center
    - DLPFC: DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX
    - Allocates attention according to your perception about whatâ€™s going on at that time
- If had the ability to proceduralize a task before injury
    - They should be able to use DLPFC
    - The more we ask a pt to think about a task, the more we ask them to be cogntiively aware
- When we ask someone to dual task
    - Absorb DLPFC resources so that they are constrained or forced to use procedural memory centers (PreMotor, BG, cerebellum, SMA)
    - Natural centers to process the task

# Types of Dual tasking

- Manual
- Visual
- Cognitive
- Auditory

## Manual
Dual tasking in gait: Manual

- Zipping, buttoning/unbottoning a shirt, jacket
- Pouring water
- Texting

## Visual

- Add coins presented to total
- 2-3 d shape rotation
- Face to name matches (novel)

## Cognitive

- Relaying directions (from here to my home)
- Explain favorite sport
- Generate a list of sports teams, red items, etc

## Auditory

- Encoding/recalling grocery list for later recall
- Listening/ Talking to friend


# Taxonomy

Resource of type of task (single task vs dual) 

- Task novelty 
- Complexity low vs high 
    - Dependent on ability

Start with lowest complexity, choose a task with minimal novelty
