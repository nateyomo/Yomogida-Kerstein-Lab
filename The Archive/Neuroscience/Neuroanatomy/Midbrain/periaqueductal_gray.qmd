# Anatomy

- Surrounds cerebral aqueduct

# Function

- Primary Control center for Descending pain modulation / Analgesia:
    - Produces: Enkephalin or Dynorphin = Suppress pain
    - Pain bypasses Thalamus & limbic system
    - Critical in ANS responses
    - Behavioral responses to threats

# Output

Sends nerves to the Locus coeruleus to increase activation and therefore release of Norepinephrine
