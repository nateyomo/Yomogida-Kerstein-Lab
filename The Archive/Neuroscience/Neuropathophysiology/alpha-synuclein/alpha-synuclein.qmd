title: "&alpha;-Synuclein (&alpha;-syn)"

---


&alpha;-synuclein refers to highly soluble unfolded protein that accumulates in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in [Parkinson's disease (PD)]({{< var ref-parkinsons-disease.path >}}) and other synucleinopathies.


# Causes

- Several studies have given different reasons for abnormal aggregation of α-syn @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024.
- For example, researchers have found mutations of the A30P, E46K, and A53T proteins, as well as duplications of the SNCA gene, which encodes α-syn @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024
- Oxidative stress is an important factor for the aggregation of α-syn to form Lewy’s bodies @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024.
- Defects in ubiquitination have also been described as a cause for abnormal degradation of the protein by neuronal proteasomes @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024.
