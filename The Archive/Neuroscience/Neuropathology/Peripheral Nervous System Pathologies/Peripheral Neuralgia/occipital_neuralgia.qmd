# Anatomy

- Pathway
    - Leaves the spinal column through the arch of the atlas and the axis
    - Travels toward the area of C2/3 facet joint inferolaterally and then curves around the inferior oblique capitis mm to ascend toward the occiput deep to the semispinalis capitis mm
    - Pierces either the tendon of the trap or between then trap and semispinalis to reach the occipital area
- Formed by posterior division of CN II 
- Greater  occipital nerve is the largest purely afferent nerve in the body

# Innervation
Innervates the post skull from suboccipital area to the vertex

# Associated pathologies

- Cervicogenic headache
