# Braak's Hypothesis

1. &alpha;-syn is produced in the periphery @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024
1. &alpha;-syn proagates to the CNS @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024
1. &alpha;-syn in the CNS causes the disease @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024



# Movement of &alpha;-syn to the CNS 
Furthermore, it was observed that vagal nerve sections prevented the intestine-to-brain propagation of fibrils and neurodegeneration [11]. Thus, the vagus nerve seems to serve as the conduit for Î±-syn propagation from the gut to the CNS @montalban-rodriguezGutBrainRole2024
