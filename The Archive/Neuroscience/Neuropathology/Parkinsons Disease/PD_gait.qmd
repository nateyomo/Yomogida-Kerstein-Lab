### Effective Treatments

- Gait training was found to increase stride length in PD patients @osbornePhysicalTherapistManagement2022
- Step length improved with treadmill and RGAT @osbornePhysicalTherapistManagement2022
- There is no consensus on which type of gait training is best for stride length @osbornePhysicalTherapistManagement2022

### Ineffective Treatments

- PNF based (nonambulatory) gait training (rhythmic initiation, slow reversal, and agonistic reversal exercises applied to the pelvic region) did not improve step length @osbornePhysicalTherapistManagement2022
