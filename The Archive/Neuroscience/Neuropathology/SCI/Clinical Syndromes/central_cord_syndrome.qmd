title: Central Cord Syndrome
---

# Epidemiology

- Most common spinal cord syndrome @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019

# Etiology

- Generally occurs from hyperextension injuries to the cervical region
- Congenital or degenerative narrowing of the spinal canal
    - The compressive forces give rise to hemorrhage and edema, producing damage to the most central aspects of the cord. 
    
# Clinical Presentation

There is characteristically more severe neurological involvement of the upper extremities (UEs) (cervical tracts are more centrally located) than of the LEs (lumbar and sacral tracts are located more peripherally).

Varying degrees of sensory impairment occur but tend to be less severe than motor deficits. With complete preservation of sacral tracts, normal sexual, bowel, and bladder function may be retained. Patients with central cord syndrome typically recover the ability to ambulate. Some distal UE weakness and loss of fine motor control remain, which can result in moderate to severe limitations in the ability to perform functional tasks.
