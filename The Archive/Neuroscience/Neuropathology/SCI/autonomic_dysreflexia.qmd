# Epidemiology

- Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in patients with an injury at T6 level or above. 


The condition is induced by sensory stimulation below the level of the injury, and is characterised by sudden, uncontrolled response in the sympathetic nervous system.
- This results in episodes of paroxysmal hypertension, frequently accompanied by baroreflex-mediated bradycardia (9, 10). Systolic blood pressure of 250–300 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 200–220 mm Hg have been recorded with autonomic dysreflexia (11).
