Lets start with a paddle "stance."
You should try to keep your position as hydrodynamic as possible.

| Region | Optimal Position | Why| Cueing tip |
|---|-------|--------------|-------|
|T/S| Extension | Better vision & better shoulder position for striking the water  | |
| Pelvis | Posterior pelvic tilt (PPT) | Reduce low back fatigue | Drive pubic bone down into the board |
| Legs | Together (not apart) | Less drag | |
