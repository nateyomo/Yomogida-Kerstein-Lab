# Notes on how to begin hitting aerials

Speed and timing are the main prerequisite skills combined with a wave that allows for a couple pumps (speed) and becomes vertical enough for one to launch off of.

## Speed
- If you go too fast you will be sent to the moon and lose control.
- The goal is to launch while but only slightly off the wave and controlled.
    - 1/5 m is the starting goal here.

## Timing

- Look for small wedging end sections
- Like a waist/chest high wave with a nice little waist high wedge launch ramp. 

You need a wave that will let you get a few pumps for speed, then is vertical enough to actually let you launch up and out over it, not a mushy wall that's really slopey. If you need to stall up and wait for the section to start closing out. If you watch pros they'll frequently stomp the tail and wait for the wave to wall up more, then pump down the line a few times before launching off the lip.

As far as how long it takes, it just depends on the person and I think more importantly age. I learned to surf around 8-10 and didnâ€™t learn to do a real air until 8th grade. So however long that is was my time taken. Im 30 now and still trying to learn how to do new grabs and rotations. Also, I think as a kid its a bit easier as you are trying to one up all your friends etc and have 8hr surf days and endless energy haha.

## What kind of waves are best for learning?


- Waves that throw a nice lip
- Not too big heavy or shallow, so you can get enough energy to go up in the air from the wave. 

Probably a good size to start is like waist to chest high. You don't need super long waves, you just need the right section that throws a nice lip and you need to time it right. I'd recommend practicing stalling up high on the wave next to the white water while you wait for the close out section to stand up, then pump and get some speed and hit the lip at the right time and you'll do an air. It's all about timing. You want the lip to hit you forward toward the beach so you don't go out the back of the wave. Having a super light board will help too because it's very quick and lighter so it will go in the air easier.

# Be Careful!
Launching higher and higher on aerials without "soft landings" is a great way to break your board into many pieces.

When you launch high, go for a grab. This technique allows you to bail and toss the board to the side safely
