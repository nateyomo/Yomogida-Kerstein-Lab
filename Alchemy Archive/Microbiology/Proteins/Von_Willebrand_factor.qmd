# Overview

- vWF is a multimeric plasma protein present in blood plasma and platelets and produced in endothelium, megakaryocytic and subendothelial tissues @hassanStructureFunctionWillebrand2012
- Facilitates hemostasis by stabilizing coagulation factor VII (a clotting protein, helps in platelet adhesion) and recruiting platelets to injured vessel wall or thrombi through interaction with GPIb-Î± @hassanStructureFunctionWillebrand2012

# Clinical significance

- Increase in vWF in the blood = indicator of endothelial injury @hassanStructureFunctionWillebrand2012
