# Singh et al. (2017) Effects of Topical Icing on Inflammation, Angiogenesis, Revascularization, and Myofiber Regeneration in Skeletal Muscle Following Contusion Injury @singhEffectsTopicalIcing2017b

- Independent variable: Icing vs sham treatment
- Dependent variable: presence of [neutrophils]({{< var ref-neutrophil.path >}}) and [macrophages]({{< var ref-macrophage.path >}}); expression of CD34, von Willebrands factor (vWF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and nestin; vessel volume; capillary density; and myofiber regeneration in skeletal after muscle contusion injury in rats
    - Muscle tissue was collected 1, 3, 7, and 28 d after injury
- Population
    - Rats
    - n =
