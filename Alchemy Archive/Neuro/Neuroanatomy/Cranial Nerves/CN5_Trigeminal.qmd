# Overview
CN V Trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial nerve and provides general somatic sensory to the scalp, teeth, oral and nasal cavity as well as branchial motor functions to the muscles of mastication and some surrounding musculature [@blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022; @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014].

Additional functions

- Additionally, The trigeminal system plays a role in facial and dural sensitivity and has also been considered a component in brain nociceptive innervation @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.
- "Proprioceptive nerve fibers from the masticatory muscles and (probably) extraocular muscle" @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014.



The Trigeminal nerve's course can be broken down into:
- Brainstem
- Cisternal segment
- Meckel’s cave segment
- Trigeminal ganglion
- Pperipheral divisions: Opthalmic division (V~1~), Maxillary division (V~2~), and Mandibular division (V~3~).

Why should I care about this nerve?
- The trigeminal nerve is the anatomical substrate of several pathologies or conditions, including: Headaches (primary or secondary), trigeminal neuralgia, and alternate types of orofacial pains @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.
- Understanding the complex anatomical arrangement of CN V's pathway is crucial to understand these conditions’ pathophysiology and treatment @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.

# Anatomy
## Brainstem
Within the brainstem there are 4 central nuclei of CN V:
- [Mesencephalic nucleus]({{< var ref-mesencephalic-nucleus.path >}}) (Conveys afferent proprioceptive fibers from extraocular and masticatory muscles and allows for bite modulation @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014)
- Principal sensory nucleus
- Motor nucleus
- Spinal trigeminal tract & nucleus



Afferent fibers of the mesencephalic nucleus convey pressure and kinesthesis sense from the teeth, periodontium, hard palate, and temporomandibular joint capsule. This nucleus is concerned with mechanisms that control the force of the bite (Carpenter, 1991b). It is located within the lower midbrain and upper pons lateral to the sylvian aqueduct along the lateral mar-gin of the periaqeductal gray matter and anterolateral to the fourth ventricle, medial to the sensory nucleus (Figs. 1A and 1B) (Go et al., 2001).

# Sensory Aspect
## Sensory Pathway

![Trigeminal Sensory System Nuclei and Pathways (from Blumenfeld figure 12.8 @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022)](/Alchemy Archive/Neuro/Neuroanatomy/Cranial Nerves/images/fig12.8 Trigeminal sensory system nuclei and pathways blumenfeld2022.png)

- Somatosensory afferent nerves convey crude touch, pain, and temperature sensation from the face and mouth to the lateral pons @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- These nerve fibers then descend the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the [spinal trigeminal nucleus]({{< var ref-spinal-trigeminal-tract.path >}}) @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- . Similarly, the spinal trigeminal tract is analogous to Lissauer’s tract (see Figures 6.4 and 7.2). Secondary sensory neurons from the spinal trigeminal nucleus cross the brainstem to ascend as the trigeminothalamic tract (or ventral trigeminothalamic tract). The trigeminothalamic tract is analogous to the spinothalamic tract (see Table 12.6), and the pathways travel together to the thalamus (see Figures 12.8 and 14.3). Trigeminothalamic tract fibers synapse in the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), and tertiary sensory neurons then travel in the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex. Like the anterolateral systems in the spinal cord, there are also pathways from the spinal trigeminal nucleus to intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the reticular formation, and other areas, to mediate the affective and arousal aspects of facial pain.


In summary, it is generally believed that sensory fibers involved in the conduction of pain and temperature spread over the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and then cross over to the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex @henssenNewInsightsTrigeminal2016


## Sensory Function

- V~1~ Opthalmic supplies the upper face
- V~2~ Maxillary supplies the middle face
- V~3~ Mandibular supplies the lower face

The trigeminal nerve also provides touch and pain sensation for the nasal sinuses, inside of the nose, mouth, and anterior two-thirds of the tongue. 

## Dysfunction

- [Trigeminal neuralgia]({{< var ref-trigeminal-neuralgia.path >}})

# Motor Aspect
## Motor Function

# Meninges Sensitivity

The trigeminal system not only supports sensation to the face, but also the dura and pia @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.


# Brain innervation

# Pathways



- The trigeminal nerve exits the brainstem from the ventrolateral pons @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- Next CN V enters Meckel's Cave (a small fossa posterior and inferolateral to the cavernous sinus) @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- CN V synapses on the trigeminal ganglion (sensory ganglion) in Meckel’s cave @blumenfeldNeuroanatomicalBasisConsciousness2016.
- The ophthalmic division (V~1~) travels through an inferior section of the cavernous sinus and exits the skull through the superior orbital fissure @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- The maxillary division (V~2~) exits via the foramen rotundum @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022
- The mandibular division (V~3~) via the foramen ovale @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022

## Mnemonic
A way to remember the exit points of each trigeminal division is "Standing Room Occupancy", or SRO (for Superior, Rotundum, Ovale)
:::

In addition, pain sensation for the supratentorial dura mater is supplied by the trigeminal nerve, while the dura of the posterior fossa is innervated by CN X and upper cervical nerve roots.
