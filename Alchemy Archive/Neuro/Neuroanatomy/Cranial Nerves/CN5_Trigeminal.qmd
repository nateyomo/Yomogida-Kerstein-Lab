# Overview
CN V Trigeminal nerve is the largest cranial nerve and provides general somatic sensory to the scalp, teeth, oral and nasal cavity as well as branchial motor functions to the muscles of mastication and some surrounding musculature [@blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022; @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014].

Additional functions

- Additionally, The trigeminal system plays a role in facial and dural sensitivity and has also been considered a component in brain nociceptive innervation @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.
- "Proprioceptive nerve fibers from the masticatory muscles and (probably) extraocular muscle" @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014.



The Trigeminal nerve's course can be broken down into:
- Brainstem
- Cisternal segment
- Meckel’s cave segment
- Trigeminal ganglion
- Pperipheral divisions: Opthalmic division (V~1~), Maxillary division (V~2~), and Mandibular division (V~3~).

Why should I care about this nerve?
- The trigeminal nerve is the anatomical substrate of several pathologies or conditions, including: Headaches (primary or secondary), trigeminal neuralgia, and alternate types of orofacial pains @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.
- Understanding the complex anatomical arrangement of CN V's pathway is crucial to understand these conditions’ pathophysiology and treatment @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.

# Anatomy
## Brainstem
Within the brainstem there are 4 central nuclei of CN V:
- [Mesencephalic nucleus]({{< var ref-mesencephalic-nucleus.path >}}) (Conveys afferent proprioceptive fibers from extraocular and masticatory muscles and allows for bite modulation @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014)
- [Trigeminal sensory nucleus]({{< var ref-trigeminal-sensory-nucleus.path >}}) Conveys tactile and pressure sense @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014
- [Trigeminal motor nucleus]({{< var ref-trigeminal-motor-nucleus.path >}}) (Modulates degree of bite)
- [Spinal trigeminal nucleus]({{< var ref-spinal-trigeminal-nucleus.path >}}) & [Spinal Trigeminal tract]({{< var ref-spinal-trigeminal-tract.path >}})

## Trigeminal Root (Cisternal Segment)

- The 4 trigeminal nuclei (3 sensory, 1 motor) extend throughout most of the brain stem @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014
- "The trigeminal root is composed of the large sensory root and the small motor root" @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014
- "The sensory root receives somatosensory sensation from the entire face , temple, external acoustic meatus, and the anterior scalp as far posterior as the vertex of the skull" @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
The trigeminal nerve supplies somatosensation to the entire face except the angle of the jaw innervated by the cervical plexus @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014
:::


 The proprioceptive impulses from the masticatory muscle run through the motor root to enter the mesencephalic nucleus @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014

The large sensory rootlets of the trigeminal nerve exit the lateral aspect of the midpons medial to middle cerebellar peduncle with the ophthalmic division being most inferior, the maxillary in the middle, and the mandibular division in the superior position (Fig. 2A). As the roots pass anteriorly through the prepontine cistern and Meckel’s cave to the trigeminal ganglion in the middle fossa, they rotate approximately lateral 180 degree rotation (Jannetta, 1996; Shankland, 2000). However, Rhoton (2000) reported that the fibers from the mandibular division remain in a caudolateral position in the trigeminal root throughout the interval from the ganglion to the pons, the ophthalmic division rostromedial, with maxillary division fibers in an intermediate position @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014

he small motor roots emerge from the pons anterosuperomedial to the entry point of the large sensory root (Saunders and Sachs, 1970; Lang, 1981). Some authors defined two motor rootlets groups of the trigeminal nerve; a primary superior and a secondary inferior motor rootlets, with numerous connections between both of these and the sensory root. The superior rootlets group, with its distinct position, and relative isolation from the main sensory root, represents the classic origin of the motor root (Fig. 2B) (Saunders and Sachs, 1970; Lang, 1981; Yousry et al., 2004). The inferior motor rootlets are visualized after retraction of the superior motor group from the sensory root (Figs. 2B and 2C). Pelletier at al. (1974) contend that the physiological characteristics of the inferior motor root were identical to that of the motor fibers and subserved either a motor or proprioceptive function rather than a sensory function (Pelletier et al., 1974). The two separate motor groups join together a short distance from the brain stem to form a single root and passes through the Meckel’s cave on the medial side of the sensory root and ganglion to join the mandibular division @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014

Peker et al. reported cisternal portion of the 100 trigeminal nerves measured 12.3 mm (range 8–15 mm). The root exit zone (REZ) of trigeminal nerve (the precise nerve-pons junction) and central-peripheral myelin transition zone (TZ), mentioned in the trigeminal neuralgia, are separate structures. The length of central myelin (distance from pons to TZ) on the medial aspect of the nerve (range, 0.1–2.5 mm; mean, 1.13 mm; median, 1 mm) was shorter than that on the lateral aspect (range, 0.17–6.75 mm; mean, 2.47 mm; median, 2.12 mm) @jooMicrosurgicalAnatomyTrigeminal2014

## Sensory Pathway

![Trigeminal Sensory System Nuclei and Pathways (from Blumenfeld figure 12.8 @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022)](/Alchemy Archive/Neuro/Neuroanatomy/Cranial Nerves/images/fig12.8 Trigeminal sensory system nuclei and pathways blumenfeld2022.png)

- Somatosensory afferent nerves convey crude touch, pain, and temperature sensation from the face and mouth to the lateral pons @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- These nerve fibers then descend the spinal trigeminal tract to synapse in the [spinal trigeminal nucleus]({{< var ref-spinal-trigeminal-tract.path >}}) @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- . Similarly, the spinal trigeminal tract is analogous to Lissauer’s tract (see Figures 6.4 and 7.2). Secondary sensory neurons from the spinal trigeminal nucleus cross the brainstem to ascend as the trigeminothalamic tract (or ventral trigeminothalamic tract). The trigeminothalamic tract is analogous to the spinothalamic tract (see Table 12.6), and the pathways travel together to the thalamus (see Figures 12.8 and 14.3). Trigeminothalamic tract fibers synapse in the thalamic ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM), and tertiary sensory neurons then travel in the internal capsule to the primary somatosensory cortex. Like the anterolateral systems in the spinal cord, there are also pathways from the spinal trigeminal nucleus to intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the reticular formation, and other areas, to mediate the affective and arousal aspects of facial pain.


In summary, it is generally believed that sensory fibers involved in the conduction of pain and temperature spread over the trigeminal sensory nucleus complex (TSNC) and then cross over to the contralateral thalamus and cerebral cortex @henssenNewInsightsTrigeminal2016


## Sensory Function

- V~1~ Opthalmic supplies the upper face
- V~2~ Maxillary supplies the middle face
- V~3~ Mandibular supplies the lower face

The trigeminal nerve also provides touch and pain sensation for the nasal sinuses, inside of the nose, mouth, and anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

The trigeminal system not only supports sensation to the face, but also the dura and pia @terrierTrigeminalPathways2022.


# Brain innervation

# Pathways



- The trigeminal nerve exits the brainstem from the ventrolateral pons @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- Next CN V enters Meckel's Cave (a small fossa posterior and inferolateral to the cavernous sinus) @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- CN V synapses on the trigeminal ganglion (sensory ganglion) in Meckel’s cave @blumenfeldNeuroanatomicalBasisConsciousness2016.
- The ophthalmic division (V~1~) travels through an inferior section of the cavernous sinus and exits the skull through the superior orbital fissure @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022.
- The maxillary division (V~2~) exits via the foramen rotundum @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022
- The mandibular division (V~3~) via the foramen ovale @blumenfeldNeuroanatomyClinicalCases2022

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Mnemonic
A way to remember the exit points of each trigeminal division is "Standing Room Occupancy", or SRO (for Superior, Rotundum, Ovale)
:::

In addition, pain sensation for the supratentorial dura mater is supplied by the trigeminal nerve, while the dura of the posterior fossa is innervated by CN X and upper cervical nerve roots.
