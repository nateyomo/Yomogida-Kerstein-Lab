[Emotion processing (Salience)](#emotion-processing)\n1. [Agency](#agency)\n1. [Attention](#attention)\n1. [Interoception](#interoception)\n1. [Predictive processing/inference](#predictive-processing-inference)\n\n## Emotion processing (salience) {#emotion-processing}\n\nDysfunction in the emotional processing construct manifests as emotional reactivity, deficits in emotional awareness (ie physiological arousal in absence of emotional arousal), amplification of FND symptoms in some mood states (ie panic, shame), aberrant salience processing, etc @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\n\n## Agency {#agency}\n\nDysfunction in Agency manifests as impairment in belief/circuit around: Pt is agent of action/Free will → produces voluntary movement @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nMovement lacking self agency is experienced as involuntary @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nThese involuntary movements are clinically deemed functional tremors or functional seizures, but the brain areas generating these movements are the same ones involved in the production of voluntary movements @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\n\n## Attention {#attention}\n\nAttentional perseveration is defined as the \"tendency to focus on a physiological system to the neglect of other systems, and an impaired ability to adaptively, volitionally shift attention @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\"\nThis concept is analogous to hemineglect syndrome wher patients *can* attend to his/her unaffected body parts but this focus is considerably difficult and requires conscious effort @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nLikewise, patients wtiAllocate attentional resources to threat stimuli (ie angry faces) (especially those with functional seizures)\n\n## Interoception {#interoception}\n*Interoception* refers to a process by which the nervous system senses/interprets/integrades internal body signals into conscious and unsconscious perceptions of sensation @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nIn FND, the percetion produced through interoception can be abnormally enhanced or diminished @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nAbnormal interoception sensations can materialize as attenuated visual, auditory, or skin sensitivity @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020. \nAbnormal interoception can impact movements and result in tremors, dystonia, seizures, and weakness @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\n\n## Predictive processing/inference {#predictive-processing-inference}\n\n*Predictive processing/inference* refers to the process by which a person generates beliefs about cause/effects of events within/outside body @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nEnvironmental conditions can rapidly alter this process @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nFND patients with this dysfunction can demonstrate erroneous perceptual inference (about sensorimotor or emotionally valenced phenomena), and their beliefs become reality @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\n\n:::{.callout-note title=\"items that need to be cleaned up and added to the paragraph\"}\nDeficits in decision making and sensory processing @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\nPrior history dominates ongoing perspectives @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout title=\"Examples\"}\n\n- Someone who expects weather to be cold will wear a winter jacket even on a sunny day in summer @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\n- Functional leg weakness → pt does not sense that limb IS there, opposite of phantom limb syndrome @draneFrameworkUnderstandingPathophysiology2020.\n:::\n\n\n## Abnormal sensory input {#abnormal-sensory-input}\nupdated by sensory input that indicates it IS there\n\n\n# Subjective {#subjective}\n\n## History\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nDue to the importance of MOI and risk factors, the subjective should Focus on predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors! @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n\n:::\n\n\n- Adverse experience in childhood/recently? (very common)\n    - Attachment theory (life growing up) \n- Consider: Social/cultural norms, life experiences, religion, language, stress \n- Psychological comorbidities\n- Comorbidities\n\n## Other medical evaluation\n\n- Beliefs about the medical system\n- Low rate of misdiagnosis → did a doctor diagnose? @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n    - IBS?

Dissociation? infection?)  @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n- What are your triggers now? (if any) @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n\n\n\n## Functional limb Weakness {#functional-limb-weakness}\n\n- Functional limb weakness\n    - Does it feel like the body does not belong to them? @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n    - Any sensory disturbances associated with it? @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n    - Collapsing weakness? @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n    - Any falls?\n- Expect: voluntary movements are hard while automatic ones are preserved. Also expect that there is a global pattern- affects flexors/extensors equally @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n\n## Involuntary movements\n\n- Functional tremor?\n    - aggs/eases?\n- Functional seizure: @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021\n    - any urinary incontinence/physical injury?\n    Seizure plan?\n    - Any precursors like autonomic arousal? → note: \n\n:::{.callout-note}\nfunctional seizures can be seen as an involuntary, learned brain “reflex” that gets rid of unpleasant sensations.

The examiner ensures that the patient's face is shielded (in case of an organic etiology) and lifts the patient's plegic arm, suspending it over the patient's face, then abruptly allowing the arm to fall. The patient will deflect the arm from hitting the face in the case of FMD.79\n\n\n## Functional Tremor\n\nIn the arms, ask the patient to copy a rhythmical movement made between finger/thumb using their better hand @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021.\nIn the legs, ask the patient to copy foot tapping @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021.\nAnd in the neck, have the patient follow movements of your hand with their tongue @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021.\n\nIn a functional tremor, one should expect to see variable frequency (not amp) tremor that changes dramatically during externally cued rhythmic movements @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021.\nIf the tremor on the other hand stops, entrains to the same rhythm, or pt has difficulty copying movement → consider functional tremor @bennettPracticalReviewFunctional2021.\n\n\n:::{.callout title=\"Other distraction maneuvers via APTA\"}\n\n- Finger tapping movements at different speeds\n- Side-to-side tongue movements\n- Counting-serial 7 backward\n- Contralateral rhythmic ballistic movements\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nWhile a functional tremor will entrain with distraction, an organic tremor will typically increase in amplitude with distraction.
